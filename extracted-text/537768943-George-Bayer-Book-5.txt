Relationship between Hebrew Letters 
and Wheat Movements 
by George Bayer 
 
My old Hebrew grammar, published in 1892 says on page two: "The Hebrew alphabet consists 
of twenty-two letters, which represented originally pictures of objects or their framework, whose names 
began with these letters". 
Ginzberg, in his "Legends of the Jews", vol. l, 5 says: "When God was about to create the world 
by his word the twenty-two letters of the alphabet descended from the terrible and august CROWN of 
God whereon they were engraved with a pen of flaming fire". 
Using these two thoughts together the one a plain statement of what the writer of   Hebrew 
grammar had in mind as to the meaning of the alphabet and the other, the religious thought, brought 
forth via legends from the so-called "dark ages", when certain men knew more than we ever shall know, 
I concocted an explanation of my own as to the meaning of the alphabet. It cannot be very well 
explained how I gradually drifted towards these thoughts. Suffice to say, that the results should be 
worth the reader's careful attention. 
We are treating here a very difficult subject---one that includes many various thoughts and 
ideas, which have to be digested. For better understanding, tests should be made on your own part with 
various charts of stocks and on charts of the various commodities covering several years. 
The rules and explanations which follow may be at times a little disconnected anticipating at 
times facts that are explained a little later, or I may be going back to some previous thought in order to 
cover all possibilities for clearer understanding. 
The main idea of this, and of all other articles that will follow from month to month is to impart 
to the reader a clearer conception about the movements in the stock and wheat market their causes and 
effects. None of my articles have anything to do with creed or race, neither with politics. All my work 
is original and solely deduced through the studies of market movements, whereby all other sciences 
have to be entered into facts taken out and incorporated into stock market science. 
Let us inspect for a moment our ancient Hebrew alphabet as shown on Page 5. We note it is not 
the alphabet in current use to write in Hebrew. It is the “old style” Hebrew alphabet. The letters 
resemble more Egyptian hieroglyphics than they do the present Hebrew alphabet. It should not surprise 
us that this is so when we consider for a moment that this ancient Hebrew script must have been used at 
a period that may be close to three or four thousand years ago. The ancients alphabet reveals its true 
meaning, while the Modern Hebrew alphabet has its meaning partly removed. 
The only thing retained in the present Hebrew alphabet is the direction in which the letters are 
written, i.e. instead of writing forward as is done in all modern languages, the letters are written 
backward. But to the keen eye, which gradually has become accustomed to look for hair splitting detail, 
it shows that the originators of these writings covered up something of great importance. 
We shall attempt to put the hidden meanings of the ancient Hebrew alphabet to practical use in 
stock marker operations. 
The Hebrew alphabet starts with 'haleph'' or "alpha" in Greek and ends with "taw, the Greek 
"omega". For our purpose we have to turn the entire alphabet around and start with ''taw', i.e. "omega" 
and proceed the other way so that after "raw" follows "sin", "rash" and "qoph" until we reach "haleph". 
In the Scriptures it says: "I am the alph and the omega, the beginning and the end". It should be read: ''I 
am the taw going as far as haleph, from the beginning to the end. I am one complete cycle. 
 
Here is the law, which I am trying to prove in the present article:  
 
3
ONE CYCLE such as we call IN THE STOCK MARKET a bull movement or a bear movement 
IS REPRESENTED BY THE TWENTY|-TWO LETTERS OF THE ANCIENT HEBREW 
ALPHABET. 
The letters are written backwards, from taw via sin up to haleph as stated above. We now 
attempt to join the letters shown on page5 by writing them tentatively into a bull movement as well as 
into a bear movement on hand of a daily high and low chart. We obtain two scales: let us call them 
"ladders" because they have to incline upwards or downwards in conformity with the trend of a bull 
movement respectively or a bear movement. 
We can see them actually in motion fully alive and moving on the wheat chart given on Pages 6 
and 7. 
A bear trend started for wheat in July 1937 and continued till March 1939. 
The illustration shows the wheat performance from July 1937 to June 1938. The balance of the 
chart from June 1938 to June 1939 will be brought in the June 20th, 1939 issue. 
On the church steeple of a catholic church we find a cross. This is the Hebrew letter Taw, or the 
Greek letter Omega. It is "on top" of the church because that is where it belongs the same as the letter 
taw belongs on top of a bull movement at which place the alphabet begins. When I say of beginning I 
actually mean the end of the alphabet, because letters are written backwards so the beginning is at the 
back, at the 22nd letter. 
Let us trace the letters one by one on hand of the wheat chart and let us see how we fare in 
discovering them, one by one, as they follow in accurate order of the alphabet during the entire 
movement from July 6th, 1937 to May, 1939. 
It must be remembered that occasionally a short movement creeps in, such as the one from 
January 9th over to January 19th, 1938, which seemingly cannot be incorporated into the letter 
belonging to this period. However, we have to consider that in modern writing we do not set each letter 
singly, but join one to the other. The same occasionally have been true with the ancient Hebrew writing. 
In stock or wheat movements when a "new letter" is about to be written into the graph or daily high and 
low chart we need a connection a "hyphen". This idea anticipates somewhat things, which we need later 
on and it is given here so as not to interrupt the drift of thought at the time we reach such cases. 
Our first letter of the ancient Hebrew alphabet is "Taw". In the market i.e. in our wheat chart of 
1937, it represents nothing but the peak day of July 6th 1937:  top of the market. 
The second letter backwards is "sin". It is expressed in the form of a W,  
 
whose lines are all drawn heavy. Any stroke in a letter drawn heavy means: Any stroke in a 
letter drawn heavy means:  big volume should occur at this time. "Sin's" first stroke is from July 5th 
down to July 10th, the up-stroke from July 10 to July 14th, the second down stroke from July 14th to 
July 16th and the last up-stroke from July 16th to July 17th, 1937. 
By this time the letter ''sin'' was completed. Now, when anyone "sins" according to religious 
thoughts, he is apt to go to h... The wheat market, by that time, completed the letter "sin" and just look 
at the chart and see what happened to it. It began to form the letter "resh". The small ring in the letter 
"resh" should mean a "gap", i.e. a small space between the trading range of one day compared to the 
trading range of the next day.  In our actual wheat example it did not make the gap, however, July 20th, 
1937 was a wicked day of decline.  
 
The next letter in the alphabet is "qoth".  It begins July 25th, makes the little head of the ''qoph'' 
over to July 31st; and then followed the stroke down to August 9th. Volume was heavy during this 
down stroke because the letter ''qoph'' this a heavy line down.  
The next letter is "tsadhe". Its movement begins August 12th and ends August 31st, 1937. Here 
4
we have our first case of the "hyphen" mentioned before. It seems impossible to connect ''qoph'' with 
"tsadhe" in one sequence; therefore we had a run-up August 10th and 11th, for two days so as to fit our 
next letter ''tsadhe'' real nicely into the picture.  
The letter "pe" is somewhat harder to find for the inexperienced eye, but just look at the play 
between August 31st, September 8th, down to September 13th. Its shape is triangular: a sharp up and a 
sharp down. It is not rectangular such as the ancient Hebrew ''pe'' is written. In case you had 
commitments in wheat at that time you surely felt as if everything was rectangular. However, aside of 
this, I must state that the letter ''pe" as well as the letters ''lamedh'' and ''gimel'' which we will find later 
do not have to have the very slant as written.  After ''pe'' comes ''hajin".   "Hajin's|" form is an O; the 
only thing that is round in the market is a gap or a day when one single sale is made at one price. In my 
estimation the letter ''hajin'' means end of one phase, beginning of a new phase.  
The letter ''hajin'' represents the low point of September 13th, 1937, the point where ''pe'' ends, 
and ''szamekh'' our next letter starts. The form of 'szamekh'' shows ups and downs; such movements we 
had between September 13th, and September 30th, on fairly light volume since the thin lines of the 
''szamekh'' indicate it.  
Our next letter "nun" was a heart breaker; wheat broke 15c until it completed its engraving on 
the tape. The volume during this decline representing the letter "nun" (none!) was rather small. Most 
traders expected the resumption of the bull movement since we had fallen back to levels, which 
prevailed at end of March and early April 1937 in Winnipeg wheat prices. The thinness of the letter 
strokes of "nun" shows that the 15c had to be lost on small volume. However very few knew that the 
letter "mem" was following the letter "nun". We note that this letter extends from October 14th to 
November 8th, 1937. The end of "nun" was October 13th, 1937 and the two waves belonging to "mem" 
where formed thus: low October 13th, first dome October 16th, next low October 19th, second dome 
October 21st and October 26th, 1937.  
Then followed the wicked stroke down on big volume to November 21st, and 26th, because the 
letter shows heavy shading at the second top from where the sheer drop was supposed to start. Close 
inspection of the original Hebrew letter "mem" reveals that the bends are at the topside of it. This, 
however,  
 
5
does not bring any difficulty since we know the form of “mem”.  Its “tail” is pointed down like 
6
the tail of Scorpio.  The next letter is "lamedh" or the Greek letter lamda. Its Hebrew form is like the 
abbreviation demarking an angle of 45o. This letter, if you had known about it at that time would have 
been worth a mere 26c in wheat's movement because we rose from 1.04 1/4 to 1.18 3/4 by November 
17th, only to lose practically all of it again by Thanksgiving 1937. At that time wheat registered 1.06 
1/2. Next we find the letter "kaph". The length or duration of this letter was from November 25th, 1937 
to January 9th, 1938. Its form is rather weird being similar to our modern letter Y. The tail end contrary 
to what developed with the letter "mem" was not downward, but upward and is shown in the movement 
of wheat from December 31st up to January 9th, 1938. Therefore, let us say: in the letter ''kaph'', some 
sort of a twist develops as it reaches beyond the second half of its form. 
No explanation can be found for the cause of the movement that follows the letter ''kaph'' other 
than its being a "hyphen" to get over to our next letter ''jodh'' I am speaking of the decline which 
occurred between January 9th, 1938 and January 19th, 1938. In itself it was but a movement of 6 1/2c, 
but since we are at analyzing we cannot omit such a swing. 
January 19th, 1938 was the beginning of the letter "jodh". Since its shape and form is an up and 
down, and an up once more, the picture which had to develop in due time had to have a form of a 
modern Z lying sidewise. We find that the first upstroke lasted to February 25th, the down stroke lasted 
from February 25th to March 22nd and the second upstroke till April 8th, 1938. We note in the letter 
proper chat the first upstroke was to be on small volume. The other two strokes were to be on heavy 
volume because these ancient Hebrews purposely made the two other strokes heavy and they knew the 
reason. Close examination of Chicago wheat's performance during this period will reveal that its action 
was not the same but nearly so. Chicago rallied somewhat but we can not very easily decipher our letter 
"jodh" therein. Wheat traders should keep daily high and low charts of Chicago, Winnipeg and even of 
Liverpool, to find the letters. 
Our next letter ''teth'', is produced like an 0 with a dash in the middle. Looking at letter "teth" 
from the distance, it appears to be an "eye" with a big pupil in the center, telling you "watch your step". 
The movement from April 8th, 1938 bowed down a bit to the 12th, and came up for the final run till 
April 20th, 1938 and the ''eye'' was complete. As the most wicked letter of all the twenty|-two I name 
''cheth'' which is our next letter. The Hebrew grammar spoken of in the beginning carries an explanation 
about the letter "cheth" it says: cheth means, "house". I am sure that whenever we form our letter 
''cheth'' in the market a lot of people will go home discouraged. The entire movement is a slow but 
steady decline one day after the other; every time we buy long during this period we get it "in the neck" 
and only he who is short and just plays golf until the "house" is full, i.e. complete, will have big profits. 
''Cheth'' began April 20th and ended May 31st, 1938. 
The next letter "Zajin" began June 1st, 1938. ''Zajin'' is similar to ''jodh'', the only difference is in 
the line that issues in the center which is larger in ''jodh'' and a mere dot in "zajin". These lines also 
have certain meanings and I know their meaning. However, it would lead us too far off at this time to 
delve into this. To satisfy our immediate desire to know what they mean, be it said that it has to do with 
positions of the gaps or with days when sharp breakaway movements are due to begin. The up-stroke of 
''zajin'' leered to June 20th, 1938. The downstroke ended July 27th and the second upstroke ended 
August 4th, 1938. This latter movement was not in proportion to the first up-stroke movement June lst 
to June 20th, 1938 but it is there nevertheless. 
Next in the rhythm of letters is "waw". Its underground meaning might just as well be: "wow", 
as we say to a horse when we want to stop it. The engraving of the letter   "waw'' is similar to a dagger 
and when we compare the movement from August 4th, 1938 down to September, 6th 1938, we have the 
picture of a dagger or a saber, as good as anyone could make.  
It was Mr. Hitler who made this saber during the war scare, rattling it during all that time. 
 
Following "wow" we get the letter "he". Let us pronounce this letter carefully and if repeated a 
7
couple of times you get a word that sounds somewhat like: he-he-he, the e's being short and their tone 
high. Look at the performance of wheat between September 6th and September 28th, 1938 and you will 
recognize the "he-he" or ''ha-ha'' laughs wheat traders got after the "dagger drop" of August. The ''ha-
ha'' was worth a mere 12c, provided you knew your Hebrew alphabet backwards!  
Next letter is "daleth"; in Greek its name is delta. Using either the Greek form in capital letter or 
the Hebrew form, we find the period of October 5th to November 3rd covers this letter and its apex 
occurred on October 21st.   The next letter is ''gimel'' which reminds me very much of people who have 
the ''gimmies', give-me; a lot of the profits pocketed during the moves from July 5th, 1937 apparently 
faded away during the long stretched sidewise jiggling of wheat prices during which time this letter was 
formed. Instead of its picture being sharply down on small volume (entire letter ''gimel'' consists of two 
thin strokes), a thing that was nearly impossible to believe because major bottoms would have been 
broken through that were established back in 1936 and early 1937 on the adjusted wheat charts. 
Therefore, ''gimel'' has to be laid sidewise and not upright when laying out the market performance for 
this period. 
The next letter is "beth". It starts with a line sidewise a sort of a continuation of the sidewise 
lying "gimel". Where ''gimel" ends is not easy to say. It might have been the December 12th top 1938 
or else the January 4th top, 1939. The first stroke of letter "beth" extends to March 17th, the second 
stroke ends May 10th, 1939. 
The last letter of the alphabet is ''haleph''. This letter singular to the letter ''taw'' represents but a 
point. Around this point a complete change of feeling within the traders mind should occur. Crop 
conditions and other things that apparently influent changes in the price of wheat should turn the tide 
from a major decline that began July 6th, 1937, into a reversal of a major bull movement from this 
point on. 
However, our next letter, the 23rd letter should not be "taw " followed by "sin", but the 
movement should be from ''haleph'' via "beth", ''gimel'' and up with the only differentiation that the 
formation of the signs may have to be used just in reverse. By this I mean that "beth" should not be 
written as we have it with a side stroke as base, a line upward with a ring on top, but that the loop 
should be at the base, a sharp up-move following and a sidewise movement around high levels for a 
while so as to complete an inverted "beth". 
The rules given above should not only apply to wheat, but also to stocks and the various 
commodities as well only remember they are moving in different cycle periods. For example, in stocks 
we seem to move forward around the letter " szamekh", coming to ''hajin'' at this period, having 
produced "mem" and "nun" between January and April, 1938. In stocks the partition between "mem" 
and "nun" is shown between March 18th and March 21st, 1939 and the first part of "nun" comprised 
March 21st to March 22nd, the second part, March 22nd to 28th and the third part ended April 11th, 
1939. 
With this example I believe I have shown that some internal connection exists between the 
ancient Hebrew letters and the movements of markets when the daily high and low prices are plotted in 
graph form. Most people who trade stocks or wheat do not keep charts but they are so easy to keep and 
take but a few minutes   each day. When we are to make the entries of the day's performance it becomes 
automatically a part of our daily routine. 
 
There is no material available to check on the numbers used in ancient Hebrew. The numbers, 
no, doubt, should also reveal certain secrets. When we temporarily branch off to our modern way of 
writing and look at our Arabic numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. we immediately are able to connect them with the 
rules explained above.  They seem to represent "gaps", because they have loops such as number 2, 3, 5, 
6, 8, 9 and 0. Only she numbers 1, 4, and 7 fail to contain gaps and indicate only strong down 
8
movements with heavy volume. We note that the numbers 2 and 9 have their "gaps" on top, while 
numbers 5 and 6 have them on the bottom and numbers 3 and 8 have double gaps, the former using half 
a side, the latter full circles, a sort of a "loop-the-loop". Number 0 points to the full circle of 360* 
number 8 shows two sections of 180 each, number 3 form two sections of 90' each. Using this line of 
thought many interesting things may be found about numbers. 
The modern scripts such as we use to day also the German script, the modern Hebrew, even the 
Russian, writing seem to have been derived from this original Ancient Hebrew. At all times we have to 
be aware of the fact that up to a few hundred years or so ago comparatively few people knew how to 
read or write and it was a science by itself to know how to write. The few who did know were either 
scientists or copyists. 
The scientists' aim was to solve the secrets of motion the same as we are trying to solve. The 
secret has been solved in past ages I am sure of that and the Scriptures are proof of it. The hieroglyphics 
of Egypt also contain these secrets, as we shall see later.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Mrs. B. H. Seattle Washington. 
Would switch out of Alaska Juneau and substitute a rail stock. 
Mr. J. N., L. I., N. Y. 
Take a hedge in wheat against your cottonseed oil; hold both long. 
Mr. N. P., Ontario. 
That you failed to take on wheat when suggested does not imply that you sell your lard. It is 
apparently getting ready for the move and should be held into fall. 
Mr. R. T. Bronx N. Y. 
CN should try to get back to 20 within a reasonable time and why not pick also MOPpfd? Yes, 
trade in active stocks only and stay away from unlisted issues. 
Mr. A., Temple Texas. 
In any bull movement whenever indicated, I surely like to have commitments in pfd utilities; 
there are not many to go around and they jump in points and are much in a hurry. 
Mrs. E. B. San Francisco Calif. 
Hides move similar to stocks most of the time; while it costs little to carry a contract, they are 
dynamic movers and it is not what the broker wants now to start a commitment, it is what does he want 
after it when a temporal drop of 100 points occurs? Be careful with hides and have plenty of margin 
even though you are right in the trend. 
SUGGESTIONS: 
Especially during periods of hectic markets many traders avail themselves of Bayer's WEEKLY 
Close Range ANALYSIS of stocks and commodities. 
Its price has been reduced to $12.50 for a three months subscription. Quite frequently, during 
important runs, Bayer's opinion may be desirable so as to know how he feels about the situation from 
week to week. 
For 13 weekly issues, in some periods 14 issues, the cost amounts to but 1-8 point of a hundred 
share lot or l-4c of a contract of wheat.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
Many years of patient research concerning the movements of stocks and commodities have 
passed. No field of science has been overlooked which would give even a mite of information in 
finding laws upon which market movements could be based with any degree of safety. 
 
In the course of time we shall touch upon subjects so foreign to the average trader, so remote 
from the field of normal thought and activity that their relation to the subject could not even be 
suspected. It shall be shown gradually that vast unexplored fields yielding laws upon laws have been 
opened. These laws are not based upon what is commonly termed as astrology, but upon laws that are 
taken exclusively from the Scriptures and allied works. 
 
If you enjoy the reading of my articles, and benefit by the "Preview of Markets", tell your 
friends and traders about it.

PREVIEW OF MARKETS FOR JUNE 1939. 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO. 
 
The tide seems to be just about ready to turn. June should bring the change. The beginning of 
the month is not very favorable for stocks and as we enter the month we should decline and keep on 
declining to the 6th. An attempt of a rally should come up to June 14th, however in the two days 
following that date we can lose what little we made the 8 days previous. Between the16th June, over to 
the 15th, stagnancy should be noticeable together with small "summer" volume when everyone is ready 
to go to the World's Fair at San Francisco. 
These three days, June 16th, to June 19th, 1939 should represent the actual low levels for a long 
time to come. A fairly sharp rally should begin June 19th or 20th, calling for slowly higher levels until 
the end of the month. Small amount of trading activity, possibly the smallest in several years, should be 
witnessed during the month of June 1939. 
There are no trading opportunities during June as far as I can judge, unless you carry a timid 
short position over from May into the first part of June.  However, the main work for traders during this 
month should consist of planning and making commitments in all sorts of stocks on weakness whenever 
weakness comes into the market. I do not believe the 120 level of the Dow Jones will be broken 
anymore; and if it is broken by a point or two it should not cause uneasiness. 
Some great surprises should be in the offing next month (July) to stock traders. I do suggest to 
readers to accumulate a full line of stocks during the middle period of June and stick to it for good sized 
profits. 
WHAT WHEAT SHOULD DO. 
 
It is a somewhat different condition when we talk about wheat. This commodity seems to have 
been liquidated to a standstill during the last eight months. After long sidewise movements an important 
move should begin. In that we had a major bear market in wheat from $1.45 down to .56c, it is not very 
likely that we drop another .56c. Traders speak about excess crop conditions. Anyone who every 
studied "disappearance of cottonseed oil", for example, for which commodity figures are released every 
so often, will find that while during a certain month "disappearance of cottonseed oil" is normal, at 
other months it is so astoundingly large that we gasp. The same way, the wheat surplus should get into 
"disappearance" and nothing will be said anymore. 
Wheat should start its upward movement ahead of stocks; in fact, as we enter the month of June, 
1939, wheat should be moving up already and keep on moving up during the entire month with only 
minor reversals. One of those is indicated for June 14th, the other for June 20th, and their duration 
should each be but two days. 
Therefore, wheat traders should have long lines as we enter the month of June, 1939, and still 
have the same long lines as are leave it. However, as soon as we get into July, wheat should begin to 
make a top. 
WHAT COTTON SHOULD DO. 
 
Cotton shows bullish from June 1st up to June 19th, but it is not in a position to retain that gain 
as far as I can judge, so that after June 19th, we should lose nearly all we have gained on the upside by 
the end of the month. June 30th, however, should prove to become an important bottom for cotton and a 
brand new important upward movement should be inaugurated.

In previous years my works and articles could be obtained only in magazines, which were 
completely disinterested in actual marker movements. Magazines whose editors are orthodox believers 
in economics and "outlook" as factors from which markets could be deducted, would never have 
allowed my articles to reach their public. 
In all articles the law of repeating cycles is stressed and explained as near as we can approach it. 
Everything can be applied in a practical way to your own problems not only in market operations but 
also in your own particular line of business. 
Now that the reception of my first monthly "Preview" for June, 1939 has been satisfactory I 
present to you, this second issue July, 1939, and hope it also meets your complete satisfaction. 
Each one of my readers is requested to help me get additional readers and subscribers by ceiling 
his friends and acquaintances about this publication its purpose and aim. Many traders would be glad to 
get it; if they only knew such a work could be had. Your help in acquainting them will be greatly 
appreciated. 
You know my ability with cyclical work; let me see yours by helping get "Preview" into good 
circulation. 
Some old client when asked for his minion about ways to get "Preview" into quick circulation 
suggested that I each reader to start a chain letter, such as was used successfully by some people in 
Denver a few years ago, telling their friends and traders about my publication, but this, I consider, as 
asking too much of the readers. It is merely mentioned to record this idea.

WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS 
 
From Pecos, Texas a road leads north through the desert for 84 miles to Carlsbad New Mexico. 
After leaving this village there is no house, no farm for about 45 miles; all is desert in its true sense: the 
land is level as far as the eye can see, barren, nothing grows, trees are an unknown quantity, not even 
cactii make their homes in these parts. There is some desert grass, even occasionally single petal pretty 
flowers. 
When we cut across from Carlsbad to El Paso Texas (see map page 17) we also pass through 
desert land but the scenery is somewhat different. We find on this 150 mile stretch to start with washed 
out gravel land, scrub bush, plenty of cacti; further west meadows of spinly grass and a few cows. 
Soon after leaving White City, 20 miles west of Carlsbad, travelers have to pass through many 
richer deep dried out streambeds over which there are no bridges. What interested me about these beds 
were the huge signs at the approach, which announced: "Do not cross when it rains". Imagine rain in the 
desert!  When we went through it end of March, these stream beds were bone-dry so that we wondered 
if there ever was really any water flowing in them. Some 40 miles beyond White city, the first house, a 
gasoline station popped up. Inquiring about the signs yonder, the good man explained that at times 
during the "rainy season" these streams are impassable; they fill up so fast and become very deep so 
that a car would just disappear with the floods. However he explained further, usually they last but half 
an hour or so and the stream is again dry as before. 
What prompts me to write about this desert condition was an article in the papers last winter. It 
dealt with a bar keeper who won the first prize in the sweepstake back in 1930. He had worked in 
London and disappeared after cashing in his winnings. He was an Italian and probably went to 
Mussolini land to enjoy the unexpected flood of money forever. 
 
The story further to explain that this barkeeper came recently back to London, broke, crying to 
get his old job back. It took 8 years to reduce the first prize winnings to zero. 
Aside of the story being interesting, there is actually nothing unusual about it when we apply 
cosmic laws as we shall presently see. 
The man might just as well have been a stock or commodity trader who made a killing in the 
market as happens at times. In our thoughts then, let us imagine constantly that it is a trader we are 
thinking of as we go on into explanations of the phenomena. 
Let us get back to the desert trip! We stopped several times to look over the vast barrel area; we 
examined and ad- mired the single, faded red or pale yellow flower, half starving because they just can't 
exit on a constant diet of undisolved silicium oxide. They felt happy just the same in their surrounding. 
They waved their pretty little heads in the soft desert wind as if   they wanted to say: Get going, and   
don't worry about us! We'll get along all right!                   
Human life is part of Nature. The way we are born is the way we shall be. With "we" I don't 
mean John or Bob or Bill, I mean by "we", Nature, all the flowers, whatever their name, the mosquito, 
the cat, the tree, US steel, lard, wheat, anything that has a beginning. The snapshot of the birth moment 
indicates the way of life. What has begun cannot be altered; it has to take its course. 
The position of the planets at the time the "something" is born will indicate what is due for it; all 
we need to know are the laws that govern "motion". The Scriptures contain these laws covered over 
with paint, with many coats of paint. The writers knew their laws so well that they could devote years 
on the paint job and make no errors. 
 
Planetary positions, as they gradually change, produce upheavals on our earth. They are also 
the cause, which produce hills and dales up and down moves, deserts and streams forests and lakes, 
male and female, and oceans. Normal planetary action begets normal persons normal stock movements, 
normalcy all around. This is why the average is taken as a yardstick to judge. There are comparatively 
18
few who measure above the average; there is a large quantity found below the average. This large 
quantity of people, or of stocks which are found below the average might be compared to the large 
deserts that exist on the various continents of our earth; the Arabian desert, the Sahara and Gobi deserts, 
the vast desert land of Northern Australia, our own desert in the South-west. 
When I chose the title for this article I thought of myself as being in the desert where, when it 
rains it pours. Sometimes it is the same with people. To the barkeeper, a perfectly normal specimen of 
human mankind working day after day on his job earning an honest living fell the lot and he made a 
killing. However, since water in the desert does not stay for any length of time, winnings too, usually 
do not stay very long as many of you have also already experienced. The old, average condition 
prevails once more. Unless, UNLESS, something done immediately to protect it. We should be wise 
and build a dam. The governments, long ago, have discovered this secret for the good of all concerned.  
They build big dams (Boulder Dam) big water reservoirs where they store up Rain i.e..  Money, or in 
biblical, terms: they lock up Mr. Jupiter, which is the Planet that gives us water and money. This 
dammed water is used when and if needed. 
When we read back our first two paragraphs and make the proper substitutions, we obtain the 
ideal normal man. 
There is a normal amount of money in the family; a normal amount of money is earned. There is 
a little enjoyment here and there everything runs normally, but there is contentment and satisfaction just 
the Same. At times, better conditions develop, things begin to look brighter, and the individuals begin 
to say; "From now on things will be different, everything shapes up nicely". However ordinarily these 
conditions are but temporary. The main trend is always very slow even though it may be upwards. 
At very large intervals individuals may get some heavy rains. Big money is then made fast 
compared to the normal income. If such a streak arrives it can't be slopped; it just pours. In such a case 
the individual should pay more attention to erecting his dam so that the water doesn't flow off too fast 
as happened to the Barkeeper. But, as it is with human beings they spend it the way they make it. If it 
comes fast they let it go fast and strange, their brain matter acts in harmony with Nature's will. 
Supposing a bull movement is in full swing. Traders are all long of stocks and accumulate paper 
profits. How can they take care of these paper profits and turn them into cash in due time? There are 
two ways:  
 1) To take profits on sharp run ups and keep the cash until another opportunity presents itself.  
 2) To protect the profits with stop loss orders a reasonable number of points below the then 
prevailing price level. Such stop-loss orders, when once placed with the broker, should never be 
removed or moved downward. In case the movement keeps on going further upward, these stop loss 
orders should be gradually raised higher. As the trend changes and we go into a downtrend or even into 
a bear market, these orders should not be taken out at the moment, as many are prone to do. Let them 
have it!  
 
Do not think the whole market is declining just because "they know" you have 200 shares stopped 
below, and that after "they picked them up" the whole market turns face and runs into a new bull 
marker 200 shares, even 1000 shares count too little when 1 1/2 or 2 million shares are traded in one 
single day. 
The bar-keeper, our winner, must have spent his money like a drunken sailor, as the saving 
goes, until he had it all spent. Traders often act similarly. They buy stocks, and as the marker goes up 
they gain confidence buying more and more until, finally, they make the big commitment right near the 
top hoping "rain" will never end. They are drunk with prosperity. 
A stop loss order is left with the broker to buy or sell your stock at a time it reaches a fixed 
price, which does not compare to the current momentary price at all. It may be from 3 to 10 points 
below the current level, depending upon the type of the stock and upon visible chart resistance levels 
19
that should not be broken. 
 
For some reason or other Nature provides us with deserts, also with oceans along with this it 
provides fertile land. In comparing human beings to fertile land we must take the rich not only in 
money, but in health, in intelligence, in power, in friends etc.; the same as we have many kinds of soil 
fitted to grow the various food products. Nature also has its oceans. But when looking for similarities 
among human beings we do not fare so well unless we class among the group covering oceans the 
multi-millionaires, the celebrities whose names are known all over the world such as Mahatma Gandhi, 
Charley Chaplin and especially people who are used in caricatures. When once newsreel photographers 
are after you consider yourself very close to becoming a celebrity, even though only a temporary one. 
When the stock market moved in dizzy heights back in 1929 it also was a celebrity for a while. 
 
Since our field of explanation in this article lies down around Carlsbad, New Mexico, we might 
just as well tackle another phenomenon that I found at the big Caverns of Carlsbad. The beauty and size 
of these caverns is unsurpassed though out the world. Magnificent is no word. They must be seen. Jim 
White also must be seen. I looked at him and watched his every movement for about half an hour. He 
was so interesting! Who is Jim White? A celebrity, from my point of view. He is but a little cowboy, 
roaming the hills of the Guadelupe Mountains in the neighborhood of White City, New Mexico. This 
latter place was apparently named after him although the city can boast of but a restaurant and some 
cabins for tourists, it is nevertheless called a city just to spite New York. 
 
One day Jim White discovered a hole on the mountain near the top, which led down into the 
earth. He slid down with ropes to see what was in it. The next day he went down again and stayed three 
days exploring it. This hole is now known as the Carlsbad Caverns a National   Monument. He told his 
fellow cowboys all about what he had found its grandeur and vastness its formations but they just called 
him the "crazy cavern" or something of the sort and took no further interest in his discovery. Jim went 
to Carlsbad to spread the news about the Caverns. Then everyone said:   "That's interesting", "that’s 
nice", but that was all. He offered people to take them without cost to just show them what he found. 
Nothing doing; they wouldn't go on any fool's errand. The Caverns were all his. Sometime later he 
found another hole next to the big one out of which he saw, every evening, millions of bats emerging to 
feed. He investigated this new discovery. For thousands of years millions of bats must have lived there 
because he found dung from 30 to 100 feet deep. Going back to Carlsbad he offered to show the people 
the bats.  
 
They did not care to see bats either. Caverns and bats were taboo. Finally he found a man, a 
dealer in fertilizers, who wanted to ''1ook''.  His business sense told him than bat manure may be 
profitable to sell if obtained for nothing. Tim White, happy as a lark, had found his first visitor. After 
inspection of the bat manure deposits the fertilizer man financed its excavations, using Tim as foreman 
of the "mine". Notwithstanding the fact that this fertilizer-man was around the Caverns   for years, he 
refused to even think of interesting himself to look over the wonderful caverns. He never saw them.

22
Jim White never gave up trying to convince somebody, whoever he might turn out to be, to just 
come, please, look and see for yourself my beautiful caverns: Patience and insistence even though it 
took him nearby 25 years to achieve it brought results. He found occasionally some tourists who dained 
to look them over if it wouldn't cost too much. But Jim was reasonable. One day a fellow who, as Jim 
explained looked like a stockbroker, rich and wealthy, wanted to see the caverns. On the way over the 
23
hills Jim "made a touch" suggesting that he buys this land for a few hundred dollars, build some sort of 
approach and show the caverns to the world at large. Nothing came of that. But, they were worth 
something and Jim knew it. Finally the talk about these caverns came around to Washington and the 
result was that today the Caverns are a National Monument with daily summer visitors amounting to 
between 4 and 5 thousand people. Jim's faith in his discovery was crowned with success. 
He now runs the restaurant one thousand feet below the entrance near one of the large 
underground halls so vast that the Capitol Building at Washington would fit nicely into it even allowing 
space for the grounds. He sells a book containing his life story. Most visitors come up from the Caverns 
with one of them, and 75c is not too much for what he has written in it. It's raining in the desert for him 
and it most assuredly will stay that way for him. He deserved it!  
Let us turn this example into market operations, especially into commodity markets of the 
present time! Commodities such as lard, cottonseed, oil, cocoa and sugar have been in the dumps for 2 
1/2 years. They have been declining continuously. After darkness comes daylight. Patient accumulation 
of commodities at this period, especially the ones mentioned should bring big profits. Lard at 16c at the 
end of 1936 and 6 1/2c in June 1939 has lost all the "water" it contained. It has to "rain" again and swell 
up the price of lard as well as of other commodities even of grains.  When it does begin, the advance 
will last some time. Anyone short of these commodities since early 1937 would have to cover now and 
reverse, but who had that much nerve? This statement of holding positions for long times does not 
imply that in between movements should be utterly ignored. Trading commitments should be in one 
direction only when the board cannot be watched closely. In a bear market it is poor policy, as far is my 
experience has shown to go long for rallies and leave the market unattended for several days; while 
shorts may be covered on weakness temporarily, they should be put out again on sharp rallies that never 
fail to come into bear swings. The same way in a bull movement, short selling at such periods is often 
disastrous. The procedure should be to sell out on fast run-ups when big volume occurs and buy back 
on weakness. Should weakness not develop but important resistance points be crossed on the upside 
long positions must be resumed immediately So as to remain in the trend. For this reason it is so 
important to keep charts of the daily performance of the commodity one actually trades. 
 
SPACE FILLERS . . . .
In analyzing the statement clipped from a news paper of May 26th, 1939, from the heading "HIGH 
LIGHTS", I tried to get the drift of the story because Chrysler stock is one of my pets, and since this 
special report was found next to the stock quotations it apparently was meant for traders to decide from 
it whether stock should be held, sold or added to from here on. Three times I went over it; now you try 
and see what you can make of it! See ill. 3, page 17 
 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THE REST OF THE YEAR? 
Note: The forecast in chart form for stocks for wheat or for cotton for the second half of the year 1939, 
giving you a broad view of the way the market should develop for the balance of the year is still 
available and may be had for $12.50. The outcome of the next election, is pretty well discernible from 
the stock forecast, at least Bayer thinks so. Would it help your business? If so, get them. 
 
PREVIEW FOR JULY 1939. 
 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO: 
24
 
The uninteresting market in stocks during June 1939 has about run its course. Such narrow movements 
when not even a tape trader can catch two points in a week are usually the forerunners of big events. 
The month of July 1939 should become one of the "star" months that are not witnessed very often. It is 
hard to visualize that we should get a movement this month that has hardly any kink in it. Not since the 
big move from July 12th, 1932, up to August 15th, 1932 did this happen. However things do repeat 
once in a while and it is only up to us to find when this should occur again. There is actually nothing 
more to be said except that a steady uninterrupted upward movement is indicated for stocks all of July. I 
would have no shorts in such a market and if one intends to pyramid, mid-July would be a good time to 
add to positions as far as my work indicates. 
 
WHAT WHEAT SHOULD DO: 
 
Wheat should have completed its big movement the very day we enter into the month of July. A period 
of distribution is indicated for wheat during the month.  A reaction should start from the first of July; 
that day should become the high day for the year, unless, after going through a reaction to the 6th of the 
month, the ensuing rally brings the high on the 8th of the month. Remember, July lst as well as July 7-
8th, are always important days for wheat. You could pick 4 out of 5 in recent years that brought 
important turns of trend on those dates. A little bigger reaction should begin from July 8th, lasting until 
July 17-18, when small trading rallies that should miss the previous tops are indicated but end rather 
suddenly. The month should close at or near the lows of the month. Crop news after the early July 
government report, should be interpreted as slightly bearish by the public and readers who are wheat 
growers would do well, as far as I can judge to dispose of their crop or take hedges against it when the 
government report is ready to be released. 
Therefore wheat should get into a trading market as we enter July with gradually lower levels in view. 
 
WHAT COTTON SHOULD DO: 
 
Cotton's picture comes rather near to the wheat picture this month. While sharp run-up is indicated the 
first four days of July, the price approach to the June high would become a signal for a top, especially 
so if the volume starts ''to peter out" after the initial spurt to July 4th. A gradual sagging tendency for 
the balance of the month is indicated at least till the 28th of July. That day should find us around the 
lows of the month with higher prices indicated for August, in fact new highs should be produced. July 
17th or 18th would be a time to buy cotton back, and the rest of what you intend to carry would pick up 
between July 25th and 28th on weakness. Cotton points more bullish than grains. 
Other commodities. Due to the time it takes to analyze the many other commodities some 
distance in advance, they are not given. Sixteen of them are treated in the weekly analysis; they all 
move individually by themselves in their own cycles and must be individually judged.

HOW TO BUILD A TRADING PYRAMID 
When markets are active and moving in one direction, upward in a major up move or downward 
in a bear market, many traders are in doubt how to operate at such times.  We want to get the best out 
of trading without jeopardizing safety. We are talking about margin trading and not so much about 
outright buying. A pyramid as we commonly understand it is one of those rock piles in the Egyptian 
desert erected some 4000 years ago for a purpose apparently unknown to us. 
In mathematics a pyramid is a polyeder limited by a polygon and of as many triangles as the 
polygon has sides. When we construct a polygon Fig. ABCDEF and take outside of the plane of the 
polygon point S. From the corner points A, B, C, D, E F of the polygon we draw straight lines toward 
the point S, and lay planes between each of two adjoining lines. Such construction produces a body, 
called a pyramid. 
 We build a trading pyramid when operating in markets upon long stretched sidewise movements at 
low levels. One of these long sidewise movements illustrated in our wheat chart page 17 between 
September 1938 and April 1939. 
The base of the pyramid is the longest area in number of days that have to pass on the chart. As 
we go higher, step by step towards the peak (S of our pyramid illustration), the top of the major 
movement, the planes parallel to the base plane, become smaller and smaller in area, until we reach a 
plane which in itself is but the end point, the top. 
Let us assume the market is in a major uptrend. Most of the buying should be done at or near the 
lowest plane at the base. Stocks and commodities are prone to make big bases before they start a bull 
move. Look at wheat from September 1938 to April 1939, Sugar, from Oct. 1938 to March 1939, 
Cocoa, this Spring, Silk, last summer and fall; Stocks, June and July 1932, also from October 1932 to 
April 1933, etc. As we come into higher regions a pyramid can be started, additional purchases can be 
made at higher levels of course but in lesser quantities. As markets move still higher we still add to 
commitments on weakness when such weakness develops, but reducing the amount once more and so 
on up till we near the peak. 
As an illustration we take U.S. Steel such as it performed during the last few years. 
U.S. Steel around 40, normally forms big bases (except in extreme bear cycles). Thus a pyramid 
can be started whenever U. S. Steel reaches around the 40 level. Let us say a trader can buy 500 shares 
of stock around this level, intending to pyramid as the time becomes propitious. Charts of the daily 
performance of steel for several years back are necessary to judge right. Whenever an important level is 
crossed, the stock can be pyramided on weakness following such crossing; let U.S. Steel cross 52 1/2, 
an important resistance point. On weakness after such crossing this trader should add 300 shares more 
67 1/2 is another important point. When this level is crossed some more stock should be bought with 
parts of the accrued profits say 200 shares. When the 90 level is crossed, one more attempt may be 
made to add say 100 shares. But, when we know that the average top level in normal movements for 
steel is a little above 100 and not 262, we cannot possibly add more without endangering our pyramid. 
The higher we get in price, the nearer we get to the top of the pyramid and the bigger the reactions that 
ensue. 
Pyramids should be made in sizable distances and not a point or two apart. It would be wrong to buy 
100 shares of Steel say at 40, 100 at 41, 100 at 42, etc.  It would be worse yet to buy U.S. Steel when a 
big base has been made the following way: Say the base point is around 40 and one would enter orders, 
100 at 40, 100 at 39, 100 at 38, etc. He may get none whatever but will be glad to pay 52 for the entire 
intended lot. 
 
When the market is a buy it is a buy "at the market", and not at a stipulated price, especially 
when "chiselers" see a stock sell at 40 1/8 for two hours on big volume and they dare to enter an order 
26
at 40 or even at 39 7/8. Usually, if it does go there under conditions explained above then the stock is a 
sale and not even a buy. 
As we approach the end of an upward move, the selling period must be carefully analyzed. U.S. 
Steel crossing 100 in our assumed example would start the beginning of unloading to people who begin 
to buy at high levels, figuring that the stock now goes to 200. The first amount bought, i.e. the 500 at 
the low base could be dropped first, and as we go higher, every 4 or 5 points the next lowest bought lot 
should be sold out until nothing is left from the buying period. Immediately thereafter, without much 
delay short selling should begin. This matter of short selling has a lot of traders baffled. They don't dare 
to sell short. However, we realize that after a rise there must be a decline again. Nature changes the 
minds of people from "wanting" into "not wanting" stocks. Short selling is but anticipating lower levels. 
Because an immense lot of people see only roses blooming, they invariably buy with their accumulated 
funds, stocks at high levels. In fact they act so anxious to get stuck that they buy at "your price". Let 
theme buy stocks from you at or near the top even though you have to go out and borrow stock, 
especially so when you are fairly sure in your judgment that prices have to recede and that the big bulls 
who usually buy a stock like U.S. Steel above 100 get discouraged later on and you buy that stock at 30 
to 50% rebate or even less from them and turn it over to the man you borrowed it from. Those who loan 
stocks are usually big investment trusts or estates who hold stocks through bull and bear markets for 
dividends or for some other reason. Whoever lends the stock does not matter, but what matters is that 
you sell it to those who want stocks at high levels without even having these stocks yourself and when 
their price has receded sufficiently you buy them back from the discouraged bulls at "your price", 
turning them back to the owner, The difference in price is your profit. 
After all long stocks are disposed, a pyramid should be started for the decline; so that you 
should sell short in certain definite ways that usually turn out profitable. 
The biggest lot in the original short sale should be sold first. Say you sell 500 U.S. Steel around 
110.  Sell the next lot of 300 shares short about 10 points later, whether it is 10 points above the original 
sale or 10 points below it. The next lot of 200 shares another 10 points beyond this above or below, so 
that the full short line is out within about 30 points. As we reach the lows of a decline again we cover 
these shorts and buy long in the same manner as we proceeded on the top, only reversing the action. 
Intermediate swing traders can do the very same way when using the swings that are about the 
size of an ellipse (see my work "Time Factors''), however more discrimination has to be applied 
pertaining to gaps and it is a good rule in this type of trading to make the various purchases or short 
sales whenever a gap is made. The proportionate buying and selling should be maintained. 
A smaller trader can avail himself of the same mode of trading when using an amount of 50, 30, 
20, 10 shares, or other proportionate amounts to suit his fund. 
Such procedure precludes first of all "over trading", the worst weakness traders have. Secondly, 
it precludes ''plunging'', or what I call "being carried away with enthusiasm". It is folly to suddenly buy 
a 500 share lot of stock because you overheard an "insider" talk about this and that stock going to 130 
for sure….. Giving ear to all sorts of talk does influence traders tremendously. One case I heard of 
myself when a trader explained to me that he bought a certain stock at high levels because his uncle had 
a friend whose 2nd cousin was a runner or doorman at a big investment house and that fellow told this 
second cousin that he heard of some big man buying this stock at current levels........ So he bought that 
stock too. 
Pyramiding requires the biggest risk at the beginning of a cycle, either close to an important low 
or close to an important peak. This is when the biggest commitment must be risked. All others do not 
entail any risk whatever, as far as I can discern unless the procedure is undertaken in a different way as 
explained above. After the first commitment you play practically with the profits. It takes patience and 
time, but big profits can be made that way. 
 Of course, there are traders whose blood runs different. They are in the market for the 
27
excitement they derive from it. They should adopt these rules for the intermediate swings and should 
fare well. 
At the present period a pyramid may be started in stocks. 
 
MAKING GRAPHS FROM STOCKS AND COMMODITIES 
 
A graph or chart of a stock or a commodity should be neatly kept and be legible. The most 
suitable paper is the K.&E. paper, such as is used in the forecast tracing. I marked off a square in the 
stock forcast, see page 17. This square is the unit of plotting. For low and medium priced stocks selling 
up to about 12 dollars, one such square should represent $50 or 1/2 point in its movement (fluctuation). 
All other stocks, should be plotted one full point or dollar to the square, making the small lines in 
between the quarter points and leaving place to plot also the eights within these small lines. 
For commodities we have to make special adjustments so as to keep the price structure in 
certain proportions to lay ellipses. 
For wheat and all other grains, whether Chicago or Winnipeg, use 1c for one square or 1/4c for 
each small thin line. 
Therefore, each square represents fluctuation of $50.00 per contract unit. 
Cotton takes 10 points per square in the chart; Hides 12 1/2 points; Cottonseed oil 8 1/3 points 
per square, so that every third square you have an even number. Copper 9 points; Butter 1/4c; Coffee 15 
points per $50 fluctuation; Eggs 3/8c per square; Cocoa 17 points; Lard 10 points; Rubber 22 points. In 
Silk 4 points represents a $50 movement; Sugar 4 1/2 points (for simplicity take 4 points); Wool tops, 
one square for a single cents movement. Wool tops are always quoted in tenths of a cent thus 10/10c is 
one square. 
The charts suggested are dated on top and bottoms margin so that it is easy to plot the daily high 
and low prices on the right line. Each day of the year is contained, even the 29th of February in case we 
strike a leap year. It necessitates the omission of Sundays and holidays which spaces simply remain 
vacant. 
Readers inexperienced in drawing should first make their entries with pencil by plotting the high 
and the low price of the day with a dot and then connecting these dots with a line. Later on use a hard 
pen to draw the lines. 
Commodities must be plotted in one option as long as possible, usually until about one month 
before expiration of the option. As we get nearer to the expiration date buying by actual consumers 
comes in which apparently throws the price structure out of its equilibrium, as inspection of any chart 
will show that is kept up to the last day an option is traded. Therefore we have to "switch out" of an 
option and go into a later one usually one that has still some six months to run. From September option, 
which should be abandoned for plotting purposes about mid-August, switch into March or May options. 
The switching must take care of the price differential that exists between the plotted option and the one 
that is to be plotted from that time. On the day you change an option, you proceed as follows (as 
example use August 15th). Supposing September Wheat is selling between 81 1/2 and 82 1/4 while on 
the same day May wheat of the year following is traded between 76 3/8 and 77 1/2, then you make a 
new scale by calling the old 81-82c level from now on 76-77c level and keep on plotting the new option 
as if nothing ever had happened, ignoring completely the values of the September option.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
There are eras in existence in our world. One of them was in existence when the Bible, the 
greatest astrological work was written. At that time some people knew all the laws governing you and 
me, the markets and the life of anything, when they had to be born, when they had to die. There were no 
''shoulds nor woulds". They knew also that according to their laws the knowledge of these laws was to 
disappear again and some makeshift ideas were to take their place. This was the reason why they wrote 
the Bible. They wrote it in words that dared thousands or serious students to solve the meaning. In one 
of the Midrash it says: "If after five years of work you have not made any great progress with your 
studies, give up". I came across this passage just about five years after I had begun to really and truly 
devote practically all my time towards the study of Sacred Literature. This was around June 1st, 1939. 
At that time I asked myself candidly: How far did the five years of study bring you? The answer was: A 
few thousand pages of notes were produced, some five thousand index cards were marked with 
explanations as to what the individual words "might mean". Every corner and nook of the house has 
Bibles or other related books lying around. Whenever I got stuck in one book, I started all over with 
another, until by June 28, 1939 I was so thoroughly disgusted with the books that I just stared into 
space, saying: "George, what a fool you were, trying to solve something that cannot be solved." But, 
similar expressions I had used on myself already several times. 
Around 6:30 p.m. on June 29th, 1939, right after dinner, I decided to start for the 101st or l25th 
time, whichever time it might have been, just once more, the very last time, with Genesis 1, I and see if 
I could not find a cue as to time.. I jumped quickly over to the generations of Adam, because in them, I 
knew, had to be the timing. Once, I would know what is a year, the "beginning" was made. 
I drew on a sheet the ages of the various men quoted and by 6:45 p.m. JUNE 29th, 1939 - I 
FOUND THE TIMING, pure and simple, so astonishingly true, that I had to stop for ten minutes to get 
over the spell that gripped me right there and then. 
This point is the beginning of a NEW ERA. You shall see that it is so. Since that moment I have just 
taken enough time to rest. I have reached already Jacob as he sleeps under the heavenly ladder on the 
earth. This ladder reached to heaven (Genesis 28). 
Every word up to that point is absolutely clear to me as to its meaning and what follows will be 
clear to me within the next two months at the outside. I have, of course, subjected certain parts to tests 
already and, boys, it is grand, the Grandest thing that could be found. We all shall benefit of it real 
soon, so have just a little more patience!  
Here are a few high lights of the find:    
1. The Bible is the book explaining the effects of planets. 
2. The effect can never be obtained with what is commonly known as astrology. 
3. The names quoted in the Bible can be angles or points of conjunctions. 
4. The meaning can only be discovered by discarding completely everything that 
is shown in astrology books, excepting the names of the planets. 
5. He who is well versed in ordinary astrology and who begins to devote his full time, some 14 
hours a day, for fully five years may, if he is fortunate, his the spot to know: what is ONE YEAR that is 
always quoted in the Bible. Then he can start to build the house which does not take long to do after 
that, because by that time he has gone through the Bible a hundred times "a-hunting".    
6. The hieroglyphics of Egypt, the Mohammedan Koran, the Jewish Scriptures, the Christian 
Scriptures are all one and the same:  works that explain the effects of planets to later generations. 
 
7. Every word of the Bible is absolutely true and in its right place; it contains not one unnecessary 
30
word.

HOW CAN A TRADER STAY IN BUSINESS 
 
31
 I recall that a medium sized delicatessen store on Broadway in Long Island City, N. Y., 
changed hands several times. The price involved in the transaction was each time between $7500.00 
and $8,500.00. The stock of goods went with the deal, so did the five year lease that covered the "right" 
to be at that place under a stipulated rental which was about $100.00 per month. The new buyer each 
time had to put up in cash between $3,000.00 and $3,500.00, the balance in notes at so much a month 
until fully paid. 
The little stationery store next to it also changed hands twice in three years. The change 
involved each time $3,000.00. The cash needed to buy that place amounted to $1000.00 and the balance 
to be paid monthly until paid in full. 
Now, what did these people buy who acquired these stores? They bought a permit to operate a 
store, from the owner of the property for which they pay monthly $100.00, business or no business. 
They sought the location of the place, a fairly thickly populated section where three other delicatessen 
stores are within two blocks and four stationery stores are offering the same ware. They bought the 
"unknown quantity," the customers who are expected to buy their goods. They also bought the troubles 
that were left behind by the former owners, such as dissatisfied customers wear and tear of fixtures by 
the former owner, they bought expenses of remodeling, redecorating, renewing the store to suit their 
own taste which, as I understood cost the delicatessen men some $1,500.00 with-in three weeks. They 
bought the merchandise as is, salable and unsalable, some that might have been stocked three years ago 
by some other owner who bought it with the idea of selling it again, but since it turned out to be 
merchandise that may sell at some other place, it seems it could be sold in this place. 
The new owner had to buy additional goods from wholesalers to stock up and replenish the 
store. Thus, when we add up the expense a fellow incurs to get a store of the kind described   into 
operation, it amounts in round figures to about $5,000.00 and a debt to start with of about another 
$5,000.00. The first $5,000.00 he must have in cash else he can't start the store; the second $5,000.00 
must come out of profits. 
Everybody knows that the average delicatessen or grocery store works with a brut profit of 25%. 
After deducting rent expenses light, helps and miscellaneous, such as paper bags, he may clear 10% net, 
out of which his salary and living costs must come forth, his payments on the mortgage plus the interest 
and other incidentals not mentioned of which there are quite a few, small in single items but 
aggregating as a whole. 
He opens the store at 7 a.m. and closes at midnight. Time is no object. During hours when 
customers are scarce, he might go to his home and take a nap to be freshened up for the rest of the day. 
During all these years that I lived in that neighborhood it very seldom happened that I passed that store 
and did not see these store-keepers in their stores whatever hour it might have been; they are constantly 
on the job. 
Why are these people so much at the job? First to make money, secondly to protect the money, 
which they have invested in the store. The result of such work is a fairly steady income, which depends 
of course, upon the neighborhood and upon the individuals that patronize this store and not one of the 
three stores nearby. Courtesy to anyone who buys something, however small the purchase might be, is 
of prime importance. Price, as low as consistent with quality, is another important factor. If the house 
wife can get a package of washing soda a block away for 11c she surely is not going to pay 12c to that 
other store because of the good looks of the man. She wants to save that lc and rightly so. Whether the 
man bought it per case for 10c or for 9c or for 3c does not interest her. She is out to get a certain brand 
at the lowest possible price. Here at Carmel I noticed our own grocer charging for a can of coffee 33c 
and some time ago made a special of same, for 30c, while in all other stores the price is 29c. Upon 
inquiry he told me he cannot buy as much as the big chain stores and consequently has to pay more for 
it and thus cannot afford to sell it cheaper; result, the coffee stays on the shelf, and people go 
somewhere else to buy their coffee and many other things that otherwise would have been bought from 
32
him. 
The next factor a storekeeper has to watch is cleanliness, the display of goods to attract the eye 
of the purchaser towards his merchandise. This is an expense that costs work and material he also has to 
be a good conversationalist, besides being a good listener to all sorts of gabbing and gossiping about 
events in the neighborhood. He must know who wants to hear news and who doesn't. He must know 
about children and listen carefully when mothers explain to him about the vitamins A and B and C and 
D. 
He lives in a world of his own as small as it may be, covering but 1 1/2 or 2 city blocks. He has 
to consider himself being the Sun and the customers rotate around his store, affecting him sometimes 
and not affecting him at other times (not buying). 
As the time comes around that he doesn't care for the store any more, which includes location, 
customers amount of sales done, profits or losses accumulated he takes an agent who offers the place to 
someone else and another "king" enters to rule the store to take profit and loss and all that goes with it. 
Let us apply the thoughts and laws contained in the above case and apply them to market traders. 
The greatest fallacy in a market trader is his idea to get rich quick. As it is with a grocery man 
who has to open once his first store, so a trader has to open once an account. The grocery man however, 
opens his store or buys his store with the idea to make a living and normal profits, while a trader who 
opens his account usually does so on account of:  
1. Hearing from other people how much profits they made in this or that stock, and he tries to do 
the same. 
2. Making some side-money apart from the regular business. 
3. Going into business of trading the same as a man goes into the grocery business. 
4. Some inheritance arrived which is of abnormal size compared to what he is used to. 
5. The gambling spirit gets a hold of the man. 
On item No. 1 we just have to frequent brokers offices and listen for five minutes to traders. 
You hear all about their profits but you never hear a sound about their losses. They take for granted that 
you are not interested in losses else you would not be at that place where apparently "all is profits". He 
may tell jokes and at the very same time swear inwardly about his stock having gone off another quarter 
just now on the tape and he will not tell you that his paper loss is already seven points; he will not even 
tell which stocks he is "hooked" with, but persistently explain how he did make those two points a year 
ago and how he outwitted the smart Alecks, although after he took his profit --those two points-- that 
stock went another 12 points but he will say: "You never get poor taking a profit......" 
About item No. 2:  A store that takes in a sideline admits without stating so that his own income 
is not enough and has to take recourse to some outside item to save the business. People who trade 
stocks or commodities as a sideline are not trying for pin money although they may tell you so. They 
are trying for bigger money than their business brings in. However, trading stocks or commodities is 
different than selling a pound of meat or a can of sardines. In the latter case you are satisfied with a 2c 
profit, but in stocks or commodities one tick on the tape may represent the whole day's receipts of the 
store. When one is used to measuring in cents he is unable to measure in dollars, but strange as it may 
sound, he who can figure in dollars can do so in cents because it is easy to go down the ladder but very 
difficult to go up on it. In this instance I am not referring to the traders who are trying for swings, but of 
traders who try to catch a point here on the upside and another point the day after. 
Item No. 3:  The trader who opens an account the same way as a Grocer buys a store.  
This man usually takes an amount of say between $3000.00 to $10,000.00. He might have been 
watching markets for quite some time, so as to get acquainted with his merchandise. He knows that his 
merchandise is for selling purposes. Before he sells he has to buy (unless it is a short sale). In order to 
sell with a profit he has to buy lower than where he sells it. He knows that grocers also have 
merchandise that is unsalable for a long time because nobody wants it. When a stock does not act good 
33
or does not move within a reasonable time with the others he knows there is something wrong with it, 
and if something is wrong and the grocer does not know the reason, he will try to eliminate that article 
as fast as he can, even at a loss. The same a trader should do. A trader of that type tries to earn as much 
as he can learn about his "goods." He will try to detect what makes these up and down moves. He soon 
will realize that the secret is not buried in the corporation whose stock he trades but somewhere else. He 
knows that the number of shares off a corporation is usually the same, whether they sell for $8.00 or 
$108.00. The goods made by the corporation also remain the same; as a rule, the factories and real 
estate properties change very little too. Just the same, at one period the stock is worth 8 and at some 
other period 108. He also knows pretty soon that a stock is not always cheap because it sells at 8 and it 
is not always high priced if it sells at 108. Al1 these values are relative, belonging to the momentary 
time cycle. 
Item No.4:  Inheritance or some other source of funds that seek profitable employment. In this 
instance the unexpected fund is a cause of great worry. As a rule, the heir never thinks of: How can I 
make sure it does not flow away; what he thinks is: How can I double, treble, quadruple this money in a 
month or two months? I am speaking, in this case of people who have had a pretty tough struggling all 
along. In their hurry and rush they usually buy a "white eleplant" whether in stocks or in real estate or 
in some other enterprise. They lack experience to handle money. They can handle $30 and $35 a week 
marvelously, but anything beyond $1000.00 seems to go into the wrong channels for lack of practical 
knowledge. This reminds me of exceptions. The little corporal, Hitler, who commanded a handful of 
soldiers in the World War, is now able to handle 80 millions of Germans; so did Napoleon with nearly 
all of Europe. 
Money acquired step by step, climbing gradually is the best type. Something sudden is martial 
(depending upon the planet Mars). In New York we can see this phenomenon with the Jewish 
population. The poorest type lives on the lower East Side; when conditions become better they move to 
the Bronx; when still better, they shift to Washington Heights, later on down to Riverside Drive and 
finally they land at Park Avenue. You won't find them moving from the Lower East Side straight over 
to Park Avenue. If they do, they are out of place.   
 Item No. 5:  The outright gamblers. There is a trait in human beings, which we may term as 
incurable; gambling. Not everybody is subject to this weakness. Some drink, some loaf, others have 
other vices and some gamble. Poker, dice, horses and stock market, etc. are used by them. They figure, 
in that the market can only go two ways, either up or down, they have a 50-50 chance to win. But, as 
tests have proved, it is not so. The chances to be right "blindly" can occur only when the main rule of 
speculation is observed; buy when everybody thinks we can't go up, and sell when everybody believes   
we are entering a sustained period of prosperity and that idea goes as far as being enlarged in 
newspaper headlines. Strange as it may sound these people only get the idea of a sustained period of 
prosperity when we have been wading through prosperity for quite some time, which they did not even 
realize. 
A gambler goes to the Board Room in the morning, sees a stock strong, it looks good to him, 
and he jumps in. Not with a hundred shares is he satisfied; he takes right away all his account can stand. 
Quite often he gets away with “murder” and makes three points that day and calls it "luck" which it 
actually is. The conservative trader may have bought that stock three months ago and have been sitting 
patiently with it to see it move up three points and, because he is conservative, he gets out when the 
gambler jumps in who takes it over. Both may make three points; one in three months, the other in one 
day. However, he who made it in three months is much better off as far as I can judge than the one who 
makes it over night. The former did honest work and earned a normal profit while the latter just 
gambled. 
At periods it happens that markets run against you. The normal trader knows it. He is prepared 
for it. He does not over trade and has enough reserves to keep him above water so that he does not have 
34
to sell. Unless the situation changes completely, he will not have to take a loss. It is quite different with 
the trader who takes too much of risk. Supposing we look back to the wheat situation of 1924, when 
wheat rose from $1.00 to $2.08 in one year. The fluctuations were sizable. A rise of 25 points; was 
followed by a drop of 20c; and a renewed rise of 30c; followed by a drop of 25c; within a month or six 
weeks period. Supposing you felt the main trend was upward in wheat at that time and you bought as 
the trend started upward, nevertheless you had to have substantial margin to withstand shocks of 20-
25c. At the present period, when wheat fluctuates in a 10c range and good many got themselves into 
trouble because first of all they would not buy at or near a low but persistently waited until a 10c up 
move had occurred and then bought wheat for the next 10c up move. Such an up move should still 
develop, because wheat is not worth 60c normally but its normal price is around $1.00. So where can a 
fellow be wrong when he buys wheat between 50 and 80c if within a reasonable time it can be sold for 
close to a dollar? But, a contract of wheat cannot be handled with $500.00 margin in such a case. He 
may have to use $1,000.00 for it to make sure he is within the safety zone. A grocer uses $8000.00 to 
buy a store and has to wait for customers. A trader who buys eight contracts of wheat in the 65-70 level 
where it was hanging around for eight months (Chicago) from October 1938 to April 1939 might have 
used $8000.00. 
Each lc movement on eight contracts amounts to $400.00 A 10c movement would represent 
$4000.00 therefore, or a capital appreciation of 50 %. How long do you think it would take the grocer 
to make $4000.00 with his $8000.00 store investment? How many hours does he have to spend in the 
store, how many customers does he have to wait on to produce $4000.00 in profit (not in sales). 
And what efforts does a trader have to put in to produce his $4000.00 profit? All he has to judge 
is: is it possible at this current level to see wheat very much lower, or, is Nature taking care of the 
farmer too once in a while? If he feels that lower prices are pretty much against the laws of Nature, 
against the laws of average, then he buys and waits until Nature brings the price up. When sickness 
overcomes man, he usually has to overcome a crisis, when things look very blue for him. "They" expect 
him to die most any moment, but he does not. He recuperates suddenly and runs like blazes towards 
recovery. They can't believe it but then he gets well. So markets. When it appears from reports that 
cotton isn't worth growing, that the boll weevil does not grow any more, that everyone wears Celanese 
clothes, cotton runs up from 7.50 to 9c and nothing is said about it any more. At 7.50 a pound nobody 
wanted it because they were waiting for 5c cotton. All other commodities operate in a similar way. Of 
course, at lows and at extreme highs trading commitments are comparatively easy to make out because 
there is but one way to act. It becomes more difficult when we are in the middle of a movement. At 
such times reactions get stronger and so do up moves. Therefore margins must be higher to protect 
commitments. But at periods such as the present period, when prices have declined for 2 1/2 years 
without let up, it is idle talk to expect them to still drop another 50 %. 
While banks are paying at the present time 2% to 2 1/2% interest, or on a sum of $8000.00 an 
amount of $160   per year, let us for comparison's sake assume that one has put out $8000.00 at 6%; this 
would then yield in one year the sum of $480.00. On eight contracts of wheat, with $1000.00 margin 
per contract, the profit with one single cents movement yields $400.00, and anyone knows that wheat 
moves normally (fluctuates) more than lc per day. So that unless one just buys at the top eighth of a 
strong move he is bound to make a profit even though it may just amount to the 6%. The big trouble 
with traders is the eagerness to make more, to make it in a great hurry. Supposing we have an upward 
movement and we buy. We expect a strong movement upward. As soon as we clear commission 
charges, the rest is clear profit. At one time we have to risk the commitment. Let us assume we take 
wheat or a stock like New York Central or Southern Pacific around 13 and 14. When the price has 
moved away from the original purchase price so as to clear commission charges and say an extra point 
or so, why not place a stop loss order just a little beyond the clearance point to let you off without a loss 
in case it would reverse itself? Of course, it would be unwise to do so the very first or second day after 
35
making the commitment, because the price has to work itself away from the level. However, should the 
price have gone ahead 4 or 5 points your way, it is an absolute necessity to place a protecting stop not 
less than 1 1/2 to 2 points away from the buying price in order to insure at least some profit, even 
though the stop might be taken up and the market might turn around then and move higher. In this case 
you have a profit clinched. Then you have to wait for another opportunity, which might come at higher 
or lower levels as the case may develop. There is never any very great rush to buy and there is no great 
rush to sell, provided you keep stop loss orders. Another very good rule to use is this: when in doubt, 
get out. If things are not clear to you as to what is likely to come out of a certain movement, get out; 
this stops worrying, and there is always again a chance to make commitments. 
Therefore, a person having a capital of $8000.00 to trade with may be sitting in a broker's office 
from the first of the month to the last day of the month and may have made but one single trade during 
that entire time and may have picked up just one single point net and that conservatively either up or 
down and just the same his income from that one trade would allow him a very good living and still he 
would have his capital intact. During a thirty-day period there are always times when a commitment is 
absolutely a cinch for a. point or even two. It is in that type of trading just a matter of sufficient patience 
to await that time. Who can and will do that? Not the gambler, not the long term investor, neither the 
small trader who likes to force the issue but one who enters the market from a business point of view. 
He will be in business for years and, while not in great favor among the customers' men, he is doing big 
favors to himself. 
I have taken as an example a small businessman such as the grocer and compared his income 
and work with that of a trader with like means. We can do the same way with smaller capital, $1000.00 
to $2000.00, but we have to reduce the amount likely to be earned accordingly and not turn around and 
say this man has to increase his risk accordingly. As soon as he does increase his risk, he is on the 
minus side before he even starts and it will not be long that "they" get him unaware. Never take more 
risk than any ordinary businessman would take and the profits will be much larger compared to his.

PREVIEW OF MARKETS FOR AUGUST 1939. 
 
The market for stocks should act pretty lively as we enter the month and events of early July 
should still play the major role in the movement. Usually the hardest thing for traders to do is to take 
profits; they are always anxious to buy stocks but very seldom anxious to cash in on the profits, if any 
accrue. It may be advisable to look for a ceiling by mid-August. 
When the July rise does develop as the previous cycle indicates it ought to continue into mid-
August, more exact, the 14th of the month should become a top. A reaction is then due over to the 27th 
of August. This reaction may come very close to the level prevailing at the beginning of the month. 
From then on we should turn around sharply and close the month at top levels most likely even a point 
or so beyond the mid August peak. A minor reaction is also shown for the first three days of August, 
which may become simply a sidewise movement for a few days to resume the advance. 
I would be inclined to take some profits mid-month, buying back after a ten days reaction or so, 
to sell once more just as we enter the month of September, or even on the last day of August. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF WHEAT DURING AUGUST, 1939 
 
The first week of the month points towards a reaction. After a sidewise movement from the 5th 
to the 11th a rally should ensue that should be accomplished in steps and produce a top formation 
between August 23rd to 27th. From that time on the trend should be downward, contrary to that of 
stocks for this period. It appears at the present time that the points lost from end of July to August 11th 
will be regained by August 27th; it is even likely that the end of July top that is indicated from the 
previous cycle will be exceeded somewhat. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON DURING AUGUST, 1939 
 
The forecast of cotton for this period seems to have a similarity to the movements of stocks for 
the same period. An upward movement is indicated from the entry into the month until the 14th, a 
rather swift short lived reaction over to the 17th and a sidewise movement towards the 26th and up the 
rest of the month. This tendency should keep up into September.

GRAIN MOVEMENTS, SPRING 1939 
 
On page 34 we have daily high and low charts of the various grains as they have been traded in 
markets. We find the following plotted: Chicago Corn, Chicago Oats, Chicago Rye, Chicago Wheat, 
Winnipeg Wheat, Liverpool Wheat and Winnipeg Barley. 
Upon a superficial glance at the charts we may say there WAS an up move, which was followed 
by a decline. Closer inspection will reveal the following: While a general uptrend can be noted in all the 
grains during April and May and a decline during June, the June reaction was against my own 
interpretation shown in the June issue where I had an important upward movement to start the end of 
May. If we would not be human or else if we would have had the charts before us as they show now at 
that time, we would have recognized immediately that while the previous cycle did have a sharp up 
move, in this present cycle that same movement turned into a down move. The change of trend 
nevertheless did occur and it did occur on account of a certain planetary combination that had been 
prevailing in the heavens end of May. The date of change I located last September already and not in 
April or in May. The reason for the movement to turn into a decline instead of an up movement end of 
May is unknown to me so far. Some people who know little or nothing about planetary effects cannot 
understand why such misinterpretation can happen, Some people say: "Why, planetary constellations 
have nothing to do with wheat or anything else. It's the rain in the mid-West that brought these prices 
down. If they only would know that it is only planetary constellations that bring about rain!  
All the grains of the American continent (see charts, page 34) made a bottom on March 16th, 
1939. Liverpool wheat, however, kept on going lower to March 30th, 1939. It was the first to make its 
top on May 5th, 1939. At that time Chicago Rye started its real up- move.  Several grains made their 
first top on May 11th, such as Corn, Oats, Winnipeg Wheat and Winnipeg Barley. Chicago made top on 
May 26th and May 31st   was the last top for all grains. A few made the second shoulder on that date, 
such as Corn, Winnipeg Barley, Winnipeg Wheat and even Liverpool Wheat has a corner on that day. 
Coming to the actual decline of June, we note that Corn, Oats and Winnipeg Barley were the 
least affected. Chicago Wheat had absolutely no pity upon traders, neither had Liverpool Wheat. 
Winnipeg Wheat gave them a little breathing spell mid-June only to follow downward once more. 
Liverpool and Winnipeg Wheat made new lows compared to the March low all the others held in the 
April range of prices. 
What I can see from the group of charts is this: An aspect that has bearing on grains in general 
caused a suction of prices upward from mid-March to end of May; then the aspect ended and gradually 
lost its grip. In my own forecast I had one aspect due to strike end of May that was to bring a new wave 
upward, but as we know, it failed to make its appearance. Consequently the other aspect, the mid-
March one, having passed, grains dropped back because the suction upward was over. What is very 
interesting is: The entire situation seems to have a relation to our latitude on earth. 
We know Liverpool's latitude on earth is 530 24’ 5”; that of Winnipeg 490 54' 10" and the 
latitude of Chicago is 410 50' 1''. We do not consider in this case the longitude of the three places on the 
earth. The differential in latitude between these three places is as follows: 
from Liverpool to Winnipeg 30 29’ 45” 
from Winnipeg to Chicago 80 4’ 19” 
from Liverpool to Chicago 110 34' 4". 
When we consider the days on which the various tops were made, via:  
Liverpool May 5th;  
Winnipeg May 11th;   
Chicago May 26th;  
and substitute the degree differentials in latitude of the three places at which wheat is being traded, 
Liverpool, Winnipeg and Chicago, we find the same ratio in the number of days elapsed from top to 
40
top. There are six days from Liverpool to Winnipeg and 15 days from Winnipeg to Chicago. Let us 
divide the latitudinal differences of the places with the days differentials and we get an average of 35-
38' of latitudinal motion of SOMETHING that strikes first at Liverpool and prevents it from going 
higher; after this the SOMETHING moves downward in latitude from Liverpool towards Winnipeg at a 
latitudinal speed of 35-38' per day. We hit the top in Winnipeg wheat on May 11th and, continuing at 
the same rate of speed until we reach Chicago’s latitude, we find Chicago makes its top on May 26, 
1939. 
 Not only is this noticeable with tops, but also when we check the lows of March 1939 when 
Chicago and Winnipeg made their low on March 16th, while Liverpool ignored the American rise 
completely and moved down until March 30th, 1939. That Liverpool makes the low last and Chicago, 
respectively, Winnipeg makes the low first suits perfects into the idea I wish to bring forth, since it 
gives us a rising latitudinal movement from bottom to top with Liverpool being affected last. When we 
construct a chart of this latitudinal motion of the SOMETHING, (page 32) we see immediately that the 
SOMETHING must have reached the north pole or 90deg point in latitude and then came downward 
again, striking Liverpool first and then the others. From the moment of its inception this movement kept 
going constantly (during all of April) even during the time the object passed the actual north pole, again 
while it moved down- wards until it passed the cities wherein grains are traded. The SOMETHING may 
move as far as 0 latitude, or else it may have its terminal in latitude at the place where grain cultivation 
ends. 
Checking over previous years of the three charts of grains I find the phenomenon recurring, 
although during 1938 it did not apply at all; all grains, Liverpool, Winnipeg and Chicago, made the 
important highs and lows within three days, in fact three consecutive days formed the low levels as well 
as the high levels; only during June we had an exception, when Chicago made its peak on June 15th, 
while Winnipeg and Liver- pool made their peaks on June 20th. My own explanation of this condition 
is: during 1938 the SOMETHING was moving very rapidly, while during 1939 it moved very slowly. 
While it is possible that it is always one and the same object that affects, there is a possibility that the 
changes of 1938 were brought about by some other object. 
Mr. Einstein brought forth an assertion a few months ago that he suspects the causes of our 
troubles are more to be sought in the planet Mercury instead of in the Sun. I am working with that 
planet for years and know that long ago. The great difficulty we are faced with is that Mercury contains 
some 25 different motions in reference to our earth or to the Sun. To plot them all on one chart is 
simply impossible; to check them all is still worse. To know them all and then figure them all out from 
day to day is another story. There are motions in the planet Mercury that are used only by astronomers; 
there are motions that are only used by astrologers and there are motions in him that are not used by 
either of them and these motions seem to be the ones that have to be used in order to detect movements 
of prices irrespective of who is behind the price, a commodity or a stock. It is interesting to note that 
Chicago corn moved similar to Winnipeg wheat during this period. 
 
OVERHEARD IN BROKERS OFFICES 
 
A well educated, native American bought in an office some Pittsburgh Screw Co. stock. About 
an hour later a friend of his dropped into the office and, even important people are given to gossiping, 
he immediately had to tell his friend about his purchase. So, I heard him say: (of course, being in a 
hurry to convey the news to the other man he seemed to have forgotten all about the name of the stock 
he invested his good money in) Jack, I just bought some Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Stove and Pipe and 
Chimney, or whatever the heck they make.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
The present issue of "Preview" brings additional details of great importance, laying down gradually 
our philosophy. To some readers the relationship of these thoughts to markets and their movements 
may appear far hauled. As we get deeper into the drift of things and have laid the foundation 
thoroughly, we then will shift into more lively subjects about individual commodities and stocks, their 
performance and the reasons for such performance. 
Practically all the articles produced so far are not for a one time reading but they can be studied 
and disected time and again to obtain the deeper meaning hidden therein. 
Those who have missed an issue can obtain same at the regular rate as long as available. 
 
Carmel, Calif., August 20th, 1939. 
 
PROTECTING ACCOUNTS 
 
It often times requires certain strategies to act right when markets do not perform as we expect. 
In this article I shall try to bring ways and means to overcome difficulties so that we do not let 
ourselves grow gray hairs over night by failing to use common sense and act quick. 
In one case, back in 1932, when a trader saw his stock drop headlong, instead of acting, and 
cutting short his loss, he went off with his car for a spin and let the good Lord take care of his stock. 
Coming back just before the close of the market he saw stocks down another few points, and decided to 
wait just another day. This procedure he kept up till the margin clerk went into action and sold. 
When a house is afire, the firemen try to extinguish it with water. When stocks or commodities 
do not move according to expectations, act, to save something. Prices flow; so does money, it flows into 
someone else's pocket. We cannot always expect the tide to run our way; we also have to contend with 
an outgoing tide. Protect yourself, no body else will. We have several means of protection. These 
protections are easier to use with commodities than with stocks. 
 
PROTECTION No. 1: Stop loss order.
In order to determine where to place a stop loss order for a stock or a commodity we must 
weigh the market as a whole, the volume of trading, the price level of the market in general, the 
forecast, what the market should do and the "Weekly Analysis", if you are a subscriber to it. 
When the market is near a low level and quiet, a stop-loss should be rather close to the low 
level. When it is broken, it will be broken suddenly and a fast move will follow downward. See the lard 
and cottonseed oil performance July 1 - 10, 1939. 
When the market is in high levels and big volume is present, one usually does well by stepping 
out altogether without using stop loss orders since high level plus big volume indicates that someone 
who ought not to have stocks is buying from those who bought cheap. Newspapers help them a great 
deal by flashing across the front page all the good news about the big rise just when it is ending. 
If the forecasts points upward and the market covering the time of the forecast sells off (wheat 
June 1939) the best way would be to get out and wait or put a stop loss a few points below. The 
peculiarity and difficulty of making forecasts bring it about that once in a while one of those rays 
coming from the planets has been interpreted wrongly and instead of a steady advance for a fixed 
period, the entire move becomes a steady decline during this same period. This is not an error made by 
the planet; he knows what he wants - but a human error which through more work can be gradually 
rectified,---- but such future work does not help the trader at that critical moment; he must act and act 
43
quick and fast and----jump out before the house burns down. At times it is even advisable to take a 
reverse position at the same moment, especially if chart indications have it that a reversal into the 
original direction is very unlikely, until the time element has exhausted itself. 
The least one should do is: when a strong move is indicated in the forecast to place a stop loss 
order a few points below the price of the day the movement should begin. In case a three-point stop is 
taken, not much can be expected of the move anymore anyhow. 
 
PROTECTION No. 2  Hedging.
Aside of protecting an account with stop loss orders, we may turn also toward hedging the 
commitment. Hedging means simply to take simultaneously the opposite side for a while. Of course, 
we cannot be long of 100 shares of US Steel and hedge by selling short 100 shares of the same stock. 
This would put us into neutral altogether. However, when long of "Steel" we may hedge by selling 100 
shares of Bethlehem or 100 shares of National Steel. In wheat, we may be long in September, and when 
we put out a hedge we may go short the same amount in the December option. When hedging 
commodities we always should try to hedge on the short side the weakest option and on the long side 
the strongest one. By this I mean: if long and you want to hedge don't go short in the strongest option 
but in the weakest. And, when short in wheat and the market moves against you upward, and you 
decide to hedge, don't hedge in the weak or slowly moving option but in the strongest one. This case we 
had nicely illustrated in Cotton last fall, when all options were fairly strong and holding while October 
was the weak brother. On days of declining prices, the average option would drop 2 or 3 points, while 
October cotton at that time would lose 7 and 8 points a day. Since such conditions arise, the wrong 
hedge will cause additional losses instead of offsetting losses which is really the purpose of a hedge. 
Among New York traders and specialists, so-called, I remember that they hedge lard against 
cottonseed oil or cotton against cottonseed oil. This procedure is not good and will result in big losses 
once these commodities at times move together and at times move just the opposite way. One would 
think off hand that in as much as cotton and cottonseed oil are of one and the same plant they should 
move together. But they do it at times and at others not at all. They act like two brothers; sometimes 
they harmonize but sometimes they disagree. 
Hedging throws you practically into neutral, a further drop will increase the value of the short 
side and at the same time bring losses to the long position, thus offsetting the plus by the minus. At 
some time, however, one side of the hedge must be "lifted," i.e. released. This is only done when the 
market has stabilized itself or you have stabilized yourself so as to recognize which way the "cat 
jumps." If you are satisfied that the decline has gone far enough, then cover the short and hold the long 
or else, if you believe the rally or rise has gone far enough, drop the long position and hold on to the 
short position. From this time on you are on a one way track again. The entire cost of a hedge is the 
commission for carrying the "other side" for a while. 
 
PROTECTION No. 3: Doubling up. 
Suppose you are long of wheat. The action of wheat has become poor; wheat declines. It starts 
to break important resistance points. You might not have hedged yet; you might not have placed a stop 
loss order. Things look bad and you are long. In that case, a fast and rapid thinking process has to 
develop and you may decide to double up, i.e. sell your longs and go short the very same amount you 
have been long. However, let me warn you! It is very dangerous unless done on rallies (the doubling-up 
to the short side). I know of one case where I actually saw a fellow drop $4500 inside of 30 minutes by 
doubling up in JMP (Johns Mansville) with 100 shares. This was in 1931, when JMP sold between 90 
and 101 in March or April. Things moved fast then and he moved fast too, and he just happened to 
44
reverse or double-up "at the market," getting bottoms and tops just the wrong way. His trades actually 
were with 200 shares, since 100 shares long had to be sold and 100 shares had to be taken short on one 
and the same trade. Afterwards, the short position in the 100 shares had to be covered again and 100 
shares had to be bought long so as to be on the long side. 
 
PROTECTION No. 4: Get out and wait. 
 
When markets move fast and one is wrongly committed, instead of looking, waiting, hoping, 
expecting, asking, reading reports, and all sorts of other ways and means to prevent you from acting and 
acting fast, it is at all times a good policy to just merely get out for what you can get and then----- wait. 
Markets are here every day. Your mind works better when the nervousness cools off. When nervous, 
a man does one foolish thing after the other. His mind is not under full control. When you see a fellow 
walk up and down in a broker's office, move from one chair to the other, read a line in the newspaper, 
run up to read the news ticker, this man is the one I mean who should liquidate his holdings right there 
and then and go home and wait. He will be a nervous wreck in no time and will wind up with forced 
losses. This was exactly the way that man described above acted who lost the $4500 in thirty minutes. 
Don't let yourself get that far! 
 
PROTECTION No. 5: Do not overtrade. 
This was discussed last month. 
There is just one more thought in mind about hedging. Back in 1937, on April 7th, to be exact, 
just after passing the top of the bull movement, I saw the change developing and I sent out several 
hundred wires to my clients at that time (many will remember it when they read this), stating: hedge 
wheat and cotton (in stocks we had been short since March 9th, 1937). What happened? Most traders 
hedged, but some did not because the customer's man did not know what to do. He had never heard of a 
hedge, except of a privet hedge. The way the trader should have approached the broker would have 
been: Sell the same amount of wheat or cotton, which I am long now in the next option. Taking the case 
of 1937, when we were long in May contracts, the client should have said: sell me the same amount of 
July contracts. He could not have misunderstood such an order. 
 
MANY THOUGHTS LOOSELY CONNECTED 
 
There is a trait in human beings to make things appear in a different light. The neatly manicured 
and painted fingernails of the girls should indicate to the observer that they belong to the leisure class. 
The neatly pressed pants, the best suit is worn for an interview. The subtlest speech is used during such 
interviews. When the job is landed and the fellow starts to work he needs his overalls and occasionally 
some strong, healthy language to produce. Then he is the normal man, who shows his weaknesses and 
his virtues. 
Many, many years ago there lived people among the masses who through years of hard work

and testing (how they actually could do it in a practical way is beyond my comprehension) found rules 
about determining the future. They developed this science to such state of completeness and exactness 
that they most likely could say: this day must be a top in wheat and that day a bottom in cotton and that 
was that. In the interim they had plenty of time on hand to do something else. Just like parents are 
anxious for their children to have them learn and acquire as much knowledge as possible and teach 
them before they have to part, these men, no doubt were also looking out for their children, in this case 
for the later generations of mankind to teach them what they knew. But how was this to be done? They 
could not just blurt out and tell everybody the laws. Very few would understand them anyhow. They 
did what everybody else does to this day: They wrote the laws covered in a coat like a mummy is 
covered with cloth. They substituted certain words for others, many they kept in their original meaning. 
They produced a "code" which can be deciphered if enough time is spent on it and the essence of the 
contents, are grasped. That the great scientists of our time are working in the wrong direction on any of 
their attempts to explain the Bible can be readily seen when we read the mass of foot notes brought 
below the text in works like the Apocrypna and Pseudepigrapa. They have done wonderful work to 
translate from the original language   word for word, sense or no sense. When certain phrases gave no 
sense to them they marked them as "corrupt," but just the same they printed them because something 
told them: they are needed. 
The scientist's drift of thought is: The words as written must mean what is commonly 
understood by these words. They forget all about that the Bible is full of parables, and, what may 
interest you the most is that I found that the word parable means actually a mathematical parable, a 
parabola and "talk" means: to move. 
It bothers the scientists very little that all the figures of the Bible are constantly on the "move". 
They take them for ancient nomads or roamers. If they would only add "of the sky," they would hit the 
nail.  
While we talk about parabolas, we just as well hint for a moment at "fabula" which is the Latin 
word for "talk" and talk means movement (substantive), so that Aesop's Fables are nothing but 
movements of the Animals, but which ones? The ones commonly understood or those up above? Think 
that out yourself.  
That the word "talk" was very cleverly chosen as a substitute for "walk" may be seen when you 
read back the first four words of the last sentence: "While we talk about parabolas," meaning by 
substitution while we move about in cycles. Do we move in cycles or don't we?  
For all people who can think it must appear strange that the Church back in 1582   decided all of 
a sudden that our astronomical calculations were all wet and that we have to jump 10 days to get into 
the right rhythm. What have they to do with planetary movements? Should such a change not have 
come from astronomers who specialize in planetary movements? or, is it the Church which does its own 
work with such movements? 
At that time the command to change the astronomical calendar was simply accepted in all 
countries with the exception of England and Russia. The former accepted the change about 80 years 
later. It did not sound logical to them to just merely change around the dates, because they, as a group 
knew not the reason and the reason could not be explained but was a matter of believing. See 
Ephemeris of 1582. 
I have it from a reliable source that when a youngster wants to study for priesthood and wants to 
enter a school to study, he is required to produce first of all data about his birth from several sources 
who keep official records. These data have to be furnished before they let him know whether or not he 
will be allowed to start the course. The average family of such a boy takes such requests as a matter of 
routine, but, when we think about it, does it not feel strange that a school is so deeply interested about 
birth data? It seems to me that these data are sent to some place to undergo close scrutiny. There may be 
some monasteries in existence, which make a specialty of working up horoscopes. 
46
When we look over the mass of material that is required to figure movements, much of which at 
present is worked up by specialists, astronomers, who devote all their time to follow mathematically all 
the planets and produce their exact daily position to seconds, we cannot help but arrive at the following 
conclusion. 
Science was throughout the ages in the hands of the clergy. So was the Bible. Somehow, some 
way its true meaning was perpetuated among a few. These few had their assistants do the necessary 
clerical work without recognizing the purpose of such work. The machine might have worked as 
follows: Hundreds of monasteries all over Europe were divided into sections. One had to figure the 
movements of the Sun, another of the Moon, a third of Venus. There might have been 20 different ones 
assigned to figure planet Venus, since it contains about that many individual motions. This way all the 
work was distributed and then sent to the "operating table" at Rome where specialists who knew what 
to do with the Tables used them. As strange as it may sound to get thoughts of this kind, but I never saw 
Rome on the wrong side of the fence when it came to a war. Did you? Whenever one begins you find 
them immediately on the side of the eventual winner. During the Spanish war they recognized 
immediately Mr. Franco, the rebel. This way they temporarily became actually an ally of Germany who 
also was helping Franco as shown from newspaper reports. 
Mr. Hitler seems to be a very quiet fellow. He talks not often. But, when he does talk, things 
just fly and before anyone is aware of what happens, it's all over. This way he bagged Austria, this way 
he got a hold of Bohemia, this way he most likely will get Danzig, and the very same way he may get 
all the colonies. The same way fights happen in Munich beer Halls. You may enjoy there a mug of beer 
sitting among the crowds, when all of a sudden, with one accord, mugs full or empty begin to fly, 
chairs come next, even tables move with unbelieving speed through space-----a fight is on. After 
ambulances haul away the injured, the old harmony originally prevailing is resumed and everything is 
lovely. Markets do the same, of course; after the quiet meetings of June this year a sudden scramble for 
stocks ensued in July. The averages ran up from 128 to 145   before most people realized what had 
happened. 
Turning back to Mr. Hitler, some people claim he has clever astrological advisers who are able 
to pick the dates when things are propitious for him to act. Personally, I do not believe it, else the 
financial position of the country would be better; they would be able to take advantage of the ups and 
downs of commodity prices and benefit enormously. 
Here is another thought that merits consideration. 
Why do we use a sun year? Why is it not appropriate to use a Mercury year, or a Jupiter year, or 
a Saturn year? Or some other planetary year?∗Somebody years ago must have deemed it advisable to 
make us move by the Sun year and even that one they changed on us back in 1582. Why do the non-
believers in cosmic forces use a year anyhow? Even by using it they admit that cosmic forces make us 
do things, even though they don't say it. They admit that our little Moon (compared to space) causes the 
tides which brings about a rise of billions of tons of water with each change and a subsequent recession, 
but they are too ignorant to understand that planets are emanating rays that affect the ten ounces of our 
brains in such a way that we do just what they (the rays) want us to do. 
And this is just it that makes markets: people are made to buy and are made to sell so that tops 
and bottoms are made at the right and exact time planetary forces indicate any time in advance. The 
figuring to find or locate such tops and bottoms according to laws shown in the Scriptures is another 
story. 
Several times I told you about keeping charts of stocks and commodities to trace and follow 
their performance from day to day. The same procedure you may do with your own life and, I am sure 
many of you will be able to trace ahead the future when applying   the common laws of trend line, 
ellipse, new highs, new lows, etc. This may be done to plot financial conditions, health (a health chart) 
or business in general. Gaps* must be watched carefully. For example, someone's life goes on merrily 
47
for many years on even keel. Suddenly, something happens: "a gap", watch this gap and figure from 
this point anew: it may be up, it may be down. Observe that way the movement of your bank deposits 
and plot them either daily or monthly. Know that on important turns we get double tops and double 
bottoms; we also get single tops such as a sweepstake winning but single tops are hardly ever 
overcome. For example, a business man those average business amounts to say $5000 per year lands 
suddenly a contract amounting to $15,000. Unless another one follows in short order, I would say: this 
was the peak of the business and that business will drop below the normal mark in due time, in fact the 
big order moved him into bear market. On the other hand, when things are very bad and the end seems 
to be approaching, a slight improvement should be hailed as bullish, especially so, if a gap is made 
upward (see cotton on April 16, 1939). By this gap I mean: something arrives that was not the least 
expected and it was favorable in this case. Supposing you have taken a series of small losses, including 
a few big ones for good measure, you get scared to make new commitments because you expect more 
losses. However, the commitment turns out profitable. The next one also, possibly even more profitable 
than the first. In this case your chart would show a gap upwards and, should there even a reaction creep 
in, the gap is not likely to be closed and a bull movement is in the making for you and profits will pile 
up again. 
 
* A gap is a space left open in the price structure between one days trading and that of the following day. 
 
In the first volume I mentioned the 22 Jewish letters according to which the Lord created the 
World. The picture of a spider web, taken outside of my workshop reminded me of these 22 letters too; 
so the spider is even smarter than a lot of scientists who make faces at Mr Mars. This "Spider and his 
web'' knows more about the Bible than they ever will. Can you see it too? (see Illustration above).

MOTIONS 
 
On page 36 of the last issue I mentioned that the various planets have so many and so varied 
motions in respect to our earth as well as the Sun and of themselves, mentioning some 25 varieties of 
motion belonging to Mercury alone. All the other planets have similar motions. 
Here is a list of motions belonging to: 
Mercury: 
1. Mercury's geocentric longitudinal movement. This represents the movement of Mercury in longitude 
measured as seen from the earth. 
This motion may be direct, retrograde or stationary. Direct means that its motion is in the order of the 
zodiacal signs; retrograde means that its motion is contrary to the order of the signs of the zodiac. 
Stationary mean that at certain fixed moments it has no motion whatever but stands still in the zodiac. 
Example: On August 19th, 1939 noon London, Mercury's position is 12o 14' in the sign of Leo 
retrograde; on the 20th it reaches 12o 9' of Leo and there becomes stationary. The day after, on August 
2lst, 1939 it moves forward again so that at noon of that day its place is 12o 11' in Leo. All these 
positions are geocentric. 
2. Mercury's heliocentric Longitude (Mean Equinox of Date) for the same days is as follows: 
 
August 19th, 1939  
350o 21' 46",  4;  
 
August 20th, 1939  
354o 55' 41", 0;  
August 21st, 1939  
359o 38'   8", 7 
These positions are midnight positions London (0 hours) of the days. When we express these values in 
signs, we obtain: 20o 21' Pisces, 24o 55' Pisces and 29o 38' Pisces, values that are completely different 
from the geocentric values. 
3. Mercury has also two sorts of Latitudes, geocentric, the other heliocentric. On August 19th 
Mercury's geocentric position is at 2o 56' South and on the 21st of the month it is at 2o 21' South.    
4. The heliocentric positions of Mercury for she same dates are as follows:  
August 19th: 1939  
5o 53' 56"  
7;  
August 21st: 1939  
5o 12' 52"  
9;  
Both values are minus, i.e. below the celestial Equator. 
5. Next comes the declination of Mercury. It shows in the ephemeris that the declination for August 
19th at noon is 14o 19' North, and on the 2lst it is 14o 53' North. 
6. We have the apparent right ascension of the planet. This value is not expressed in degrees but in 
hours, minutes and seconds. In our example we find that on August 19th, 1939 the apparent right 
ascension of Mercury at 0 Hours London is 8h 55' 36", 22; on August 21st, it is 8 h 55' 34", 29; on the 
20th it is 8h 55' 20", 52. 
This apparent right ascension is the very same thing as the geocentric longitude of the planet; only one 
is expressed in hours, minutes and seconds, while the other is expressed in degrees, minutes and 
seconds of the Zodiac. The makers of the ordinary ephemeredes just take the right ascension and 
convert it into geocentric longitude; 24hours equal 360 degrees in this case, and 0 hours, 0', 0" 
represents 0 Aries 0' 0". 
7.The next item to consider is the true distance of the planet from the earth, which varies from day to 
day. Of the dates in question this true distance is as follows: 
August 19th,   
0.701279 
August 20th,         
0.719863 
August 21st,     
0.739840 
8. Not only does this position require consideration, but also the differentials of these distances, which 
are: 
49
between August 19th and August 20th plus 18584, 
between August 20th and August 21st plus 19977.  
These differentials bring the planet to an extreme far distance as well as to an extreme near distance to 
the earth. 
9. The semi-diameter of Mercury changes also constantly. It shows that on August 19th this semi-
diameter of Mercury is 4'', 76 and on August 21st it is 4", 51 at 0 hours London. 
l0. The horizontal parallax varies also from day to day. We find it to be on August 19th 12", 55 and on 
August 21st 11", 89. 
11.The time of the transit over the Meridian of Washington is also of importance. On August 19th the 
transit occurs at 11h 7' and on August 21st at 11 h 0'. 
 
Explanations of a few Latin words and sentences: 
Positus planetarum diurnus:   
noon positions of planets 
Latitudo planetarum ad die:   
Latitude of planets on the day 
Syzygiae Lunares:  
 
 
 
 
Moon aspects 
Anni veteris:   
 
 
 
 
old years 
Anni Gregor:   
 
 
 
 
Gregorian years 
cu or cum, with; 
cauda, the tail; 
the names following the Moon aspects represent the various fixed stars which are passed, such 
as hydra, the water snake: Rigel, Orion, Hercules, Arcturus, Lyre, Stellis fixis, fixed stars. 
Die, the day 
The hours given in the Table of Syzygiae lunares as well as planetarum mutuae are up to 24 
hours. 
The Ephemeris was made for Bologna, Italy, noon.  
12. The value arising from the reduction to Orbit which, contains the correction to be applied to the 
heliocentric longitude in order to obtain the longitude measured along the orbit of the planet.  This orbit 
longitude is equal to the distance from the mean equinox to the node, plus the distance from the node to 
50
the planet.   
 
 
August 19th this value is minus 11’41", 7 
August 21st this value is minus 12’ 47", 9 
13. The next value of importance is the Radius Vector of the ellipse. This value is given in logarithms 
and represents the distance of the center of the planet from that of the Sun. The values for our dates are: 
August 19th 
 9.5634116 
 
August 21st 
9.5495621 
14.  The differentials of the logs also form a sort of a motion. They are: 
Between August 19th and 20th, minus 69102 
Between August 20th and 21st, minus 69303 
15. The stellar magnitude of the planet from day to day is another item that requires watching.  During 
August this magnitude diminishes from 2.8 to 0 and covers in this time August 9th to August 29th.  
There is a plus and a minus side to the magnitude. 
16. The illuminated disk of Mercury represents another important item. We can distinguish 4 kinds of 
motions and not one has anything to do with the other except that they pertain to Mercury’s disk. 
16a. ( 16 )  The ratio of the area of the illuminated portion of the apparent disk to the area of the entire 
apparent disk regarded as circular. This value changes as follows during August 1939: 
 
August 14th 
0,026  
 
August 19th 
0,111        
 
August 24th 
0,265    
16b. ( 17) The angle between the Sun and the Earth as seen from the planet. 
This value changes very rapidly and the figures for August are: 
 
August 14th 
162
August 19th 
141
August 24th 
118
16c. (18) The angle, which the line joining the cusps, or extremities of the illuminated portion, makes 
with the meridian. This angle is of great importance due to its swift change causing there by changes in 
the human brains as to wanting something and not wanting it shortly thereafter. To show the fast 
changes occurring with this angle I have to bring its size over a few months: 
July    25th 
26° 
August 4th 
41° 
August 9th 
76° 
August 14th 
160° 
August 19th 
183° 
August 24th 
191° 
Sept. 3th 
202° 
l6d. (19) The next value of interest is the brilliancy of the disk. Also this value undergo swift changes 
as shown below: 
July 30th 
19.1 
August 4th 
9.8 
August 9th 
2.5 
August l 4th 
4.6 
August l 9th 
18.9 
August 24th

Besides these actual motions in space which all belong to but one planet (Mercury), we must not forget 
that there are fixed places of great importance whose proper motion in space is very small so as to be 
negligent for our work. The planet crossing over these spots requires attention: 
20. Mean longitude of node (Mercury) 47° 36' 29", 4 
21. Mean longitude of Perihelium (Mercury) 76° 30' 22", 8 
22. Mean longitude at the Epoch (Mercury) 149° 59' 50", 79 
Thus, we can see that the average astrologer who plays around with the geocentric longitude of the 
planets does not use nor even think of the many other motions contained in one simple planet, all of 
which must be considered and weighed as to their possible effect. 
In the event you are sufficiently interested to learn more about the effects of some of these motions and 
how they bring forth tops and bottoms in stocks and commodities, write me for a special course of 
instruction on this subject. 
All we have done here was analyze roughly Mercury's motions. We have 6 more planets to contend 
with. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto we don't need since they are not useful for our work. They are 
intensifying certain spots but that's all. 
 
A report came out on the news ticker some time ago about Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad paying some dividend. The "town 
cryer," of which every office nearby can boast of one, being a little foreigner, read it of: "Shakespeare & Ohio pays regular 
dividend."

FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR SEPTEMBER 1939 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FOR STOCKS! 
 
Labor Day brings usually a change of trend. They also say in New York brokerage offices: “Sell 
them on Rosh-Hashanah and buy them on Yom Kippur.” Rosh-Hashanah, the Hebrew New Year, falls 
on Thursday, September 14th, while Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement falls on Saturday, September 
23rd. I have quite often noticed that there is some truth to this rule, but this year the rule should not 
work so good. 
Labor Day falls on September 4th, a Monday. As said before, we usually can expect a change of 
direction over the holidays (Sunday, Sept. 3rd and Monday, Sept. 4th). This year should not be an 
exception. 
As we enter the month of September, the market should be boiling and good prices should prevail. 
This should be a top for a while from which distribution of stocks should begin, especially so if the last 
four or five days of August have been real strong and bullish feeling has come into the masses.  In that 
case would dispose of all long stocks before we close for the holidays. Leading issues would even short 
right there and cover these shorts by the 11th of the month, which is a Monday. At the same time would 
then resume long positions, expecting a gradual comeback to the end of the month for a secondary top. 
It should fall short a little compared to the top, which is expected just before Labor Day. The last few 
days of the month, September 28th to 30th, would sell out again all longs and resume short positions on 
strength for another dip into October. 
The range of movements during September could amount to some ten points in the averages, 
and the lows of August might even be violated by a few points, just the same it should not be the 
beginning of a bear movement as yet for stocks: on the contrary, we can expect a trading market at high 
levels for quite some time to come. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
 
The performance of wheat should have been rather poor during August and the rally mid-August 
should also have petered out.  After Labor Day a few days of strength are shown, followed by another, 
rather swift drop to new low ground. This sharp drop should begin by September 10th and end by 
September 18th. A rally should ensue for the balance of the month. This rally, however, should not be 
worth much and for October another dip is indicated. While wheat prices should be at very low levels, 
they are such that they wear out most any trader in that new lows are likely to appear after run-ups. 
These run-ups should thus be used for selling and not for buying wheat with the idea of a new bull 
movement being inaugurated at this time. The picture may look more like the cocoa performance 
during the first half of the year. I would keep close stops on all long positions in wheat at this period. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECTOF COTTON: 
 
Cotton should be getting strong as we enter the month and the steady price improvement that began 
last March should reach a climax this month, a major top. This top is indicated for September 23-26, 
Yom Kippur. A steady continued climb should be witnessed up to this time. On the dates given would 
switch from long to short and hold these positions into October. I would do so specially if we get big 
volume, strong advances and good news about scarcity of cotton. By the end of September cotton 
should be through with its bull cycle. 
53
Special notice: As you know, the forecasts are all made up by using apparent repeating cycles of 
what has happened previously. These forecasts for quite long periods have followed very well the 
actual developments; only at intervals Nature seems to throw a crow-bar into the sequence by 
producing exactly 100% counter move, whereby length, time, beginning and end correspond exactly 
just the same. We had this case in wheat during the first three weeks of June. We must guard ourselves 
against such occurrences. The first requisite of protection is a daily high and low chart of wheat in case 
you trade in wheat, or of cotton, if you trade in cotton, or of the averages if you trade in stocks and of 
the individual stocks which you trade in. The next requisite is a reasonable margin so that an 
unexpected move can be survived without being injured too much. Requisite number three is: learn all 
you can learn about movements, possibilities and impossibilities. Back year charts, which may be 
copied out of newspapers from the library will reveal more than anything else. We must know for 
example that commodities can rise in a straight line upwards for eight to ten months and gain 800 to 
1000 points during such a time; they can drop that much too, when we are in bear markets and, what is 
very important, the declines are usually occurring much faster than rises. Wheat can gain one full dollar 
in a year and, while doing so, can have reactions of 20 to 30c several times and just the same be bullish. 
Therefore, a 10c margin for wheat, except at very low levels, is dangerous, to say the least. Books, 
wherein valuable rules about trading are given such as "Time Factors," and others, should be studied, 
since any one who specializes in a field of endeavor must be equipped with basic knowledge. 
The next requisite for protection of any reader who follows my forecasts is: when a movement 
does not develop as analyzed and the market has not gone too far, liquidate and wait, or else reverse, by 
following the counter trend as long as the forecast shows one direction, even though it would be the 
contrary direction. This last idea is somewhat dangerous to follow since it is contrary to the previous 
cycle whose true direction will be taken up at times rather suddenly (a cross aspect might bring about 
such a condition temporarily). Since the market is here all the time, we might just as well wait and 
watch. When a house is afire we try to extinguish it. When our forecast proves faulty once in a great 
while, it is of no use letting the market get the best of us, but let us extinguish the fire as fast as we can, 
by jumping out, clearing all positions for the time being. Then, when a propitious turn is shown, get 
aboard again.

NEW DISCOVERIES 
 
Discoveries are coming pretty thick with me these days and here are some works mentioned 
which I am now sure of that they are all treating one and the same subject but with different coats; they 
are all old Text Books on Astrology: 
l.  The Bible and all those works, which are called Scriptures; 
2. All the Egyptian writings on papyri, on tablets or on tombs; 
3. All the old tales (Maerchen) such as the 7 Dwarves; 
4. All the stories of 1001 Nights and other stories from Arabia; 
5. All the myths, be they Greek or Roman. 
And---I am not venturing too far-- when I say: all the figures and persons irrespective of their 
names as well as all the places where the events are supposed to have happened which date before the 
year 1400. 
Everything supposedly coming from beyond that time are absolute inventions, produced by 
astrologers who knew the laws of planetary movements completely and their main work consisted of 
producing or preserving these laws in all sorts of forms for future generations. They all were begun at 
certain planetary constellations thus insuring permanent preservation. 
You may object vehemently to such ideas and say: what about the Roman coins that bring the 
heads of Caesar and others? True, some of the Emperors might have lived, but the stories printed about 
them are explaining planetary movements, which were embodied in these persons. 
Take the pain and read 1001 Nights. Note: that the heroes always are absent for one year; 
sometimes they make it ten years to change the situation some. However, the meaning is: now, we go 
one cycle forward. The story of the "Fisher and the Ghost" for example brings four planetary positions. 
It then lists commodities, which should be bought when the first planetary position prevails; then it 
brings commodities, which must be bought when the second planetary condition is present and so forth. 
Later on after discussing the "porter" loaded with the victuals it explains clearly when the various 
commodities must be sold again, i.e. depending upon other planetary positions. This story is one of the 
best to illustrate commodity trading. Other stories treat about other things of life. The plots are so 
cleverly chosen, so intriguing, and revealing the exact laws of astrology, i.e., the effect of planetary 
movements upon our ten ounces of brains, which the scientists explain away as being "products of a 
dazed mind" and why is this possible? Because the scientists fail to recognize the first Law about 
mankind: We are just doing what we are told to do according to our moment of birth, singly, as group 
(sailors, carpenters, stock traders, doctors) as well as Nations and finally as a people that belongs into 
the present era and not into another. 
In all these works note especially the slow and gradual build-up. First we have to do with one or 
two persons and with a simple plot; this establishes the "planetary positions." After this all persons 
begin to move; they cry and marry and make trips; they laugh and plough the field. Most of these active 
verbs mean definite sorts of movements in predefined sectors of the Zodiac, so that one who grasps the 
meaning of a few words once, will, by trial and error, be able to fasten down additional words until he 
gets a brand new dictionary. So that for example, each time I read in any of these books that someone 
"cries" I merely underline the true word for it: ''to move retrograde" and keep on reading. He, who cries, 
moves retrograde. Which planet is meant by it is identified by the name given to the person. There may 
be 5000 or even more names found in all these works, just the same we have but 7 planets to use; they 
are nicely divided among them and I have discovered also the identification of most of these names and 
which planets are meant, becomes rather easy after a while. 
Yes, market movements can be safely traced when we follow Harun Arraschid of the 1001  Nights, at 
least that is what I found! More about it in the next issue.

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION IN THE INTEREST OF 
STOCKS AND COMMODITY TRADERS 
All statements made in this publication are George Bayer's personal opinion. They are based upon apparent recurring cycles 
of time and price. The forecasts given herein, while made with the utmost care are not guaranteed. 
 
WHAT VALUES HAVE OLD THINGS? 
 
As stated in another place I like to buy old books. Let me substitute the word "seasoned" for 
"old." Newspapers, for example, are read one day and then thrown away; magazines are used a little 
longer, since their contents are such as to make them readable at any time, especially if it is a story 
magazine. But, we may not really say "any time" since this application would go too far. Let us just 
think back thirty years or so and read over stories written at that period. They feel strange, certain 
references to conditions, to style, mode of transportation, gossip of that time, etc., do not fit any more 
into our surroundings. We do not live in that time any more. 
Books of a scientific nature last much longer. Herschel's Astronomy, published more than 100 
years ago sounds and reads like a scientific book published yesterday. It has value in itself. The laws 
given therein have stood the test of time since they were correct and true. Anything that is true will 
stand for a long time. About the value of religious books, fables and tales we have enlarged already. 
Something of value is usually cheap and not expensive. You can buy Bibles for a quarter at 
Woolworth's. Tales and fables can be had in most second hand bookshops on the nickel counter, since; 
when youngsters have grown beyond reading such books they are sold for junk. 
Many valuable pieces of art, pictures, paintings, furniture, most everything contained in homes 
of rich people can be had for the proverbial song at public auctions. I am not speaking of small country 
auctions but of those held at art galleries. Rich people die; the heirs want the cash; entire estates are 
then sold at auctions for what they bring. Cheap stuff is bunched together and sold in lots, usually at a 
dollar a whole basket or a case full of ware. More valuable goods are sold by the piece to the highest 
bidder. When you visit one of these places, it puzzles you quite often that some articles that approach 
more the goods handled at stores bring much better prices than those not handled in stores. The reason 
for it is that people don't know what is of value. In one of the auctions at Irvington, N. Y., a year or so 
ago there was a bunch of colored candles, six to a box. They brought between $1.75 to $2.50 a box 
straight through, although in the stores you buy them for $0.50 a box. On the other hand, an 
Encyclopedia Britannica, which was on the shelves for three years, brought $30.00. It had never been 
used. In an auction out on Long Island last fall, a friend of mine acquired a brand new silver set for 
$200.00, which does not retail for less than $500; a few carpets, real Persians, he picked up for $250; 
try and get them in a store for less than $700 or $800. But, one has to know what he is buying. 
Everything is for sale, but there is a difference. 
The stock market (also the commodity markets) is full of bargains every day. The bargains may 
be on the upside or on the downside. 
How can we judge which ones are on the bargain counter and which ones are not? 
When it comes to buying, I have one good rule for you: the older the stock, the safer it is to buy. 
It may go down on you, but it is very unlikely that it burst and moves to zero. Time tested the stock. It 
went through the1931-1932 market, through the 1921 market, possibly already through the 1907 panic. 
Stocks that could survive these shocks should survive many others. An old stock has a record. The 
fluctuations from day to day are available for years back. A new stock may be all right, in fact, it might 
be even better than the old ones, but I prefer old books to new books. 
57
Old stamps are worth more than new ones; I know that as a stamp collector. Old paintings are 
worth more than others; the Torah, written with black fire on white fire, 2000 years before the heaven 
and the earth were made should be worth more than all the modernistic ideas of the present age. 
If a stock has been listed some 38 or 40 years ago around 50, moves down to 8 and then up to 
262 and back to 22 shows what it can do: it can be very bearish, also very bullish. But a stock listed 
within the last few months or last few years do not tell you anything about its habits, it’s possibilities, 
its good and bad features. 
Why do people speak of a "trusted employee"? Only experience can show whether he can be 
trusted or not. Admitted, everyone has to start once. When we look at the "Positions open" columns of a 
newspaper we find invariably in each ad: "experienced only need apply." Some time, somehow ‘the 
somebody’ must gain experience. We must give the people a chance to work themselves up; the same 
with stocks; we must watch the new stocks very carefully and follow their performance. If they prove 
within a certain time that they act like regular fellows and do not make stunts, which are against 
common rules, then we may include gradually one or the other to our list of “tested stocks." Any stock, 
that moves for any length of time against the general trend, eliminate it irrespective of how fast it 
moves. 
Continue this line of thought; it should be worth your while. 
 
LET’S REVEAL THE TRUTH 
 
KORAN, Chpt. III: "The unbelievers will say, this is nothing but silly fables of Ancient times. And 
they will forbid others from believing therein, and they will retire afar off from it."   
PART 1 
For some time now I am working on the book, called 1001 Nights. Fortunately, evidently by 
necessity, I bought a few years ago a German edition, 4 vol, translated from original texts by Gustav 
Weil, re-edited by Ludwig Fulda, published 1914. It consists of 1600 pages. The actual translation was 
made in 1836. The translator says in his introduction that publishers like to trim old original texts to suit 
their prospective buyers.   Several translations of 1001 Nights had been made into French were so far 
away from truth and facts that it is difficult to recognize them.  Weil insisted upon the publishers to 
either print it the way the original shows or else retranslate the French edition. *(by Anton Galland) 
The second edition of 1865 whose “Introduction” is also contained in the edition on hand, we 
find opinions of various savants and historians who have made extensive studies of Arabian literature 
and of Tales of the Orient.  They claim that these tales were not produced before the 15th Century, 
which I found myself and mentioned it in the September issue.  Places and rulers are quoted which 
could not have existed prior to that time. Coffee and tobacco are mentioned in one or two stories. These 
commodities had not been introduced prior to that time. 
Coming back once more to the first foreword, the translator says: They are children's stories, 
apparently intended originally for grown-ups, wherein we seem to recognize valuable poetry but are not 
able to peel it out. The stories are usually read too early in life; the ability to grasp their deeper meaning 
was not developed as yet, and juvenile editions are abridged here and there. But, how much does he 
profit, who as a grown-up returns to these stories! He says further: "1001 Nights is a 'creation'." He is 
right in that. "It is a book not produced by one author." He is right in that. "Nobody, irrespective of the 
amount of inventive ideas he possesses could have possibly completed such work. It is such a 
monstrous work produced by many nations and people covering many centuries." 
58
Later on I shall show by translating his own words in astrological language that he has made the 
right deductions. 
He says further: ''In these Tales things happen that never have occurred anywhere," had he 
added "in this world,'' he would have hit the nail or else, he would have had to add ''except in the 
Zodiac."  Then he comes with a very good statement: "Many hundreds of years and many hundreds of 
miles lie between this world and ours." Of course, he means: between Arabia and Germany, while the 
actual meaning should be: between cosmos and our 10 ounce brain matter. He says again: "Why do we 
not feel some space between these products of past ages and countries? Why do these stories never age 
but continue like a continuous Spring?" This is splendid, but he did not know why. Because they were 
started at a moment when planetary constellations insured continued belief and continued reading of 
such stories the same way as the Bible was produced. However, he gives an answer saying "No doubt 
because it is but a coat containing no person within it." Aha.... subconsciously he struck actually at the 
root, but he did not recognize the root. "The figures which roam around in these stories which approach 
us and retreat, which act like human beings, and are taken as living beings." We shall call them planets 
for our work. "The continued events as sudden changes from good fortune into misfortune and round 
the other way of persons even the ghosts and nymphs are so varied and changed that each carries so to 
say its own face." If you ever did some work on astrology, you know that all angles formed between 
two planets act differently, in sign, in longitude, in latitude as well as in declination; therefore we may 
distinguish thousands of combinations each having its own effect upon the brains and they are all 
treated consecutively in 1001 Nights.  He goes on saying:  
"Many of the tales are not free from awkward repetitions as well as showing a broadening out 
and explaining where such seems unnecessary." In this statement the translator is all wet. These fellows 
knew astrology; they knew the difficulties of students where they might fall down tread on slippery 
ground and go wrong. They might have stumbled at these places themselves once and to make sure that 
the sense and meaning is clearly understood so that there are not to be any ifs nor when’s, they go to the 
pain to repeat, emphasize (the same you will find in the Bible, too), to broaden out and bring back 
previous statements either actually in the same words or slightly changed. But, since hardly anybody 
knows what these books are all about they try to ridicule the writers about their awkwardness in using 
the language. "We are much astonished to find amid the most gruesome and savage traits tenderness 
and sweet talk, a high moral standard between the sexes which is far above our present "proud culture."  
Explanation: Aspects are good or bad, bring love affairs and kill ruthlessly; they make money for you 
and take it away if need be. So what is there to be astonished about? "The love stories contained in 
1001 Nights belong to the loveliest literature has ever been able to produce.” This needs no further 
comment. "Within the leaves of this book world experience of innumerable generations looks at us." 
Since planetary action covers everything, everything has to be treated in the book, all possibilities. It is 
surely not a one sided scientist who knows a little about his special branch such as counting the rings of 
a couple of thousands of trees, measuring the size of the distance between these rings, up in a 
watershed, making deductions from the past years of heavy rainfalls and getting up a book later on: 
How to determine rainfalls. If these fellows would not have put their nose into all sorts of sciences to 
dig up "planetary phenomena” they never would have been able to find the laws and furthermore 
nobody could write such multicolored stories with a sense in them. We must not compare these writings 
with the modern type of music such as my radio tries to produce once in a while just before or after I 
get my market quotations each day. I bet the writers of 1001 Nights would turn around in their grave if 
they heard such tunes and mixtures. 
He says further: "The great achievements of Science during the last hundred years (written 
1836) as unbelievable as they might appear, have strangely brought forth even more desire for Tales 
and Stories of this kind. The more our power spreads on "earth," the less is left in the dark and the 
unexplored, the more victoriously our "wisdom" finds formulas and mathematical rules, the more our 
59
path travels from "facts" to "fantasy". Answer: The subconscious feeling exists everywhere that we 
don’t know the laws of motion, although these writers of 1001 Nights and the Bible just octruate the 
truth to the readers. How hard they try can only be seen when you can interpret at least something of it. 
He even answers this question rather cleverly by saying: "If we can imagine a future time, when no 
questions have to be put anymore, which would explain everything clearly, measure it, weigh it and 
number it, would then still exist a demand for Tales?" He hits the nail: In that the "Tales" give the rules 
of all motions, which can be only gotten through longitude, declination and latitude, i.e. measure, 
weight and number. 
Mythological texts are much related to the Tales. They may be Greek or Roman, German or 
Norse. All are explaining laws of planetary motion and their effect upon human beings as well as upon 
all the other things. 
I have before me "The Classic Myths" based on "Age of Fables" published in 1855.   My copy 
was printed in 1899.  The introductory part is all we want to go into here since it represents the opinion 
of the writer and we shall try to show where he is mistaken.  He says: "Myths are stories of anonymous 
origin, prevalent among "primitive" people and by them accepted as true, concerning supernatural 
beings and events, or natural beings and events influenced by supernatural agencies. 
"Fables are made by individuals; they may be told in any stage of a nation's history---by a 
Jotham when the Israelites were still under the Judges, 1200 years before Christ, or by Christ himself in 
the days of the most critical Jewish scholarship; by a Menenius when Rome was still involved in petty 
squabbles of plebeian and patricians etc. etc. 
"Fables are vessels made to order into which a lesson may be poured. Myths are born, not 
made." 
Let us explain what he said so far. Myths are cycles originating at a common center (all are 
starting at one and the same point). They exist among the original cycles and cannot be changed. By 
"not subject to change" I mean: a planet that starts at 0 Aries will never be prevented by anything to go 
around the Zodiac 360 degrees and after a predetermined period will again reach this point. Angles, 
conjunctions, direct or retrograde motion occurring during such a transit with other planets or of itself 
matters not. Thus, such a cycle is meant by a myth, while, by a Fable, we understand cycles which are 
restrained or rather incidental, such as a conjunction between Mars and Mercury which does not happen 
with every round of Mercury, but with each second round only. Therefore, when a fable explains the 
conjunction Mars to Mercury we would be wrong to expect its effect each year since it happens but 
every two years. I am speaking here of geocentric positions and not of heliocentric movements. 
Afterwards this savant comes with things that makes me boil; "Myths are the outcome of 
"naive" guesses at the truth, of mistaken and superstitious attempts to satisfy the curiosity of primitive 
and "unenlightened" people (the ones who were able to fool the millions of "enlightened ones" for the 
last 500 years), to "unveil the mysteries of existence" (here he is again 100% right), make clear the facts 
of the universe and the experience of life (100% right) and to teach the meaning and the history of 
things (100% right). These are the questions that nearly every child and every savage asks: What is the 
world, what is man? (How about the grown ups? Do they know it?) Who made them? What else did the 
maker do, and what the first men? Whence came the commodities of life? What is death and what 
becomes of us after death? The answers to such questions crystallized themselves gradually into stories 
of the creation, of the gods, and of the heroes -----forefathers of men, but magnified, because unfamiliar 
(??) mysteries (??) and remote (yes, for him). 
Old literature abounds in explanatory myths of so highly imaginative character that   "we 
moderns!!" are "tempted" to read into them meanings WHICH THEY NEVER POSSESSED. 
(Professor, this is a very good answer). For the diverse and contradictory significations that have in 
recent years been proposed for one and the same myth could not all, at any one time, have been 
entertained by the MYTH MAKERS.''  
60
"A myth, whether explanatory or aesthetic, is of unconscious growth, almost never concocted 
with a view to instruction." My answer to this statement is: A plus is a plus and a minus a minus. It is 
yes or no; no two ways about it. Writers of books for lack of knowledge have to drag on books and 
books of what other had written already, and concoct a new book for the public, although nothing new 
is in it. A planetary aspect has but one effect; the one inherent on account of its momentary longitude, 
latitude and declination; this effect is described in the myth. The writer of the myth cannot go about and 
write a big story besides to fill a volume, when all he has to say (as an example): When Venus crosses 
its Node then this and this will happen to wheat, that and that will happen to rubber or to hides. He says 
it and that ends the MYTH. In actuality I was exemplifying here a fable since it does not cover ALL 
planets, but I cannot possibly give an example of a myth, without giving out the secret of motion, which 
I found. There are enough hints herein that some may detect it. 
He says further: "The myths preserved in the literatures of many civilized nations, such as the 
Greeks, present to the imaginative (where is the imagination??!!)) and the moral senses ASPECTS OF 
FRAUGHT with contradiction. In certain myths the gods display themselves as beautiful, wise and 
beneficent beings; in others they indulge in cruel, foolish and unbeautiful practices and adventures. 
These contradictory elements have been called the reasonable and the senseless. (Any textbook on 
astrology would enlighten the Light.). 
I don't believe this writer ever read the Jewish Legends; else he would get a fit when he reads in 
Vol. I of that series that Adam and Eve after leaving Paradise met a man who left his child with them 
and because the child cried, Adam killed it, cut it up and boiled the little tyke. He ate it and when the 
man came back to take the child away again, the child's bones rattled in Adam's stomach and revealed 
his whereabouts. Some gruesome tale, but the Hebrew writer just had no other way out to explain the 
law he was treating but by making real stew of it. The Arab stories treated the explanation of the laws in 
a real nice and refined way. We all realize that a steak can be cooked tender by one and tough by 
someone else and both call themselves "cooks." 
The trump card with his explanations of myths comes here. He says: "There are several ways of 
accounting for myths. According to the theory of DETERIORATION, man, although he had in the 
beginning knowledge of common facts, pure moral and religious ideas, true poetic conceptions, has 
forgotten with the lapse of time, the significance of words, facts, men, and events, adopted corrupt 
moral and religious notions, and given license to the diseased imagining of untrue and unlovely 
conceptions.” 
We don't require to print the rest of his arguments about the theory of "Improvement" or 
"progress." What he says above is 100% correct but unfortunately he tries to apply the reverse. In our 
age we have wandered way off from the true conception, from the facts and have stepped downward, in 
reverse, away from truth; this is why we don't realize the values of these old writings however hard 
these writers have labored to pick the right moment to make the stories permanent and accessible to a 
few. They are just dumb and blind and senseless to the noble task they have performed for us. They 
have in their dumbness the nerve of ignorance to belittle them, to ridicule them, to call them savages 
and what not. If these men could get up today and look over just a hundred books I am sure 99 if not 
100 would be burned at the stake as being just ephemeral ideas, "best sellers" for a month and nothing 
thereafter. Their works of facts can be printed at any time by any printer, and he will have a permanent 
source of income; why?  Because they were able to begin them at the right moment to embody 
permanency into them. How many a business of any sort lasts more than 5 years?  Very few, since they 
were all begun at the wrong time. But who knows the right time to start something? The myths, the 
Oriental Tales, the Scriptures (those that describe cycles), can tell you if you study them long enough 
and also take the right moment to begin with such studies!

PART II 
Since the laws of motion begin to run after me instead of me running after them, I recall that in 
the Jewish Legends there is a statement to the effect that a fellow was trying to move a mountain by 
attacking it with a shovel. The neighbors and friends inquired about his intentions and when he told 
them he was going to move that mountain they thought: that guy is nuts. However, as years went by he 
had removed quite a bit of it. The further he dug, the easier things went with him, in fact his shovel 
seemed to take gradually loads as big as a wheelbarrow would hold; suddenly, the remaining part of the 
mountain gave way all by itself, spreading and opening the vast land beyond. He had moved the 
mountain. 
Readers, I have done it and did move also that same mountain; I am on the other side of it 
already. The causes of all movements are absolutely clear to me now. But, like we find in the Scriptures 
that the Israelites had to build a Temple, so must I now take all the small particles and set them together 
into the working machinery. 
Now, since I told you this you may want to know how I removed the last half of the mountain 
which moved away as if melting. There may be some among you who would like to try just what I did. 
The laws are very hard to find and they are impossible to find for anyone who does not know the 
German language, and even this is not enough; he must understand some medieval German. This 
applies to all Scriptures including the Oriental "Maerchen'' of which I spoke in the last issue. Besides, 
he must have "tasted" a little bit of everything in the way of sciences, physics, chemistry, astronomy, 
history, biology, languages, modern and ancient, he must have gone through all possible and impossible 
systems of “astrology” such as are used by the public, he must know mathematics without taking 
recourse to "answer books." He must have gone through the mill as far as markets are concerned. 
Anyone who does not answer this description or who is not willing to study all these things first should 
abandon his efforts to solve the puzzle. Of course, eternal patience is also a requisite, since even 
"Rome" was not built in a day. A fast worker who has thoroughly digested all I have written in these 
"Previews" may accomplish the job in about ten years. It took me nearly ten years to coach myself from 
dividends and earning statements over towards the Bible; so you are saved ten years already!   
All work should be in writing, keeping notes of all thoughts and ideas as they develop so that 
the good thoughts are gradually separated from the chaff. Since we know from markets that there are 
bull movements and bear movements, we have to assume that human beings have bull movements as 
well as bear movements.  Now then, since it is difficult to distinguish when a bull movement begins in 
yourself, you simply must take a chance through trial and error to discover it. If you miss up on that 
point by a week or so you will not find the right beginning even though everything just stares into your 
face, telling you: take it. Hence, on-and-off-work on this problem would not get you far since Nature 
most likely will make you work or suggests that you work just at the time you won't find things. There 
are thousands of miners up in the Nevada hills trying for gold, but very few find a bonanza. So that 
uninterrupted hard work only will make you work "at the moment" of the right beginning to bring 
success; since points of beginning reoccur, too. Those readers who studied my "Time Factors," the 
"Astrology Lessons," or my tentative work, "Bible Lessons," have inkling as to the basic knowledge 
you have to have. Some people sent me back ''T. F.’’ telling me: it's too hard for me to understand. 
They forgot that trading in markets is the hardest thing anyone could attempt. Even for normal 
endeavors, as businessmen or tradesmen we have to study subjects like advertising methods, 
psychology of men, etc., if we want to be above the average. Many people go to special schools for 
several years just to acquire that superiority. The average man wants to go into the market as soon as he 
has some money saved up or some inheritance has put him temporarily on easy street, without the 
slightest work, having in mind to "take the gravy," but usually he doesn't get to first base. 
I shall try to bring forth gradually the reason why the various sciences must be pretty well 
mastered in order to reach the goal. Zoology, for example, you need to identify the various animals that 
62
occur throughout the Scriptures. You must know their habits else the name of an animal does not impart 
to you the hidden meaning that has some connection with the habit and action of such animal. 
Geography you need too. In 1001 Nights, you find right in the first story the mention of Asiatic places, 
which indicate the place where the story treats. In the footnote which the honorable translator has 
underneath in my volume says: "From this we can see how little geographic and historical knowledge 
the writer of these stories must have had, when he permitted a Persian ruler to be master of India and 
China.” Had he not made this statement in a footnote, I would have thought much more of him. You do 
not need the beautiful maps joined to Bibles wherein the various places of the Zodiac are put into 
Palestine, but use maps showing the world and the cities around the year 1400. But you must know in 
which country they are located and not like I remember back in 1914 when the war started that a New 
York paper put the island of Heligoland into the Pacific Ocean and it is still there as far as they are 
concerned since they never corrected that error. 
You need ancient history because most of it must be astrologically interpreted. You need 
physics to learn about motion in general, particularly the parts called mechanics and optics. Chemistry 
is important to know so that you recognize the fact that certain atoms join together and others just 
simply won’t join. Astronomical laws have to be known like ABC because on planetary motion 
everything is built. You will not be able to understand astronomy unless you know mathematics, which 
in itself contains several branches. Languages as many as possible should be mastered so that the 
relationship of the words of the various languages can be compared. Botany we must not forget either. 
There are hundreds and hundreds of trees and flowers, shrubs and perennial flowers mentioned each for 
a purpose of its own. Beware if you don't know what kind of grass barley is! 
I recall back some 28 years, when Sepp Mueller, my school chum and myself tried to master the 
shift of consonants while studying original medieval German texts. Three ancient texts have so little 
relation to the present German language that the average German cannot understand a word of the 
meaning of a sentence contained therein. We may compare this to medieval English or French, of 
which I had occasionally used certain texts already too. 
We learned that certain consonants became subject to a change within a word, so that p became 
an f, t turned into s, s turned into an r, f became a v, k became ch. This change happened around the 
year 600. This way, out of lepel became Loeffel, from water became Wasser, from laten, we obtained 
lassen, fater gave Vater, etc. 
You may ask: what has that got to do with markets? It has a very far reaching relation with 
movements of all markets, because I am going to prove in a round-about way that to figure markets we 
have to enter fields that on the surface have no connection at all. 
As stated in the last issue, the Bible, the Jewish Scriptures, the Oriental Tales and all the other 
writings of this sort are writings to explain the Laws of Motion of everything. I now discovered the 
final and biggest thing: The Oriental Tales without exceptions are a product of Southern Germany and 
"made in Germany" produced somewhere in Upper Bavaria, around Wasserburg or Wessobrunn, and 
never have seen Arabia. Yes, laugh that off! How can a man get such monstrous ideas into his mind? 
We may understand it somewhat when we know that they produce the most wonderful Cannibal 
pictures right in the heart of Los Angeles. Someone some 500 years ago had in mind to write down the 
astrological laws in a new form compared to the form they had been available so far. It had to be in an 
exotic form, in that the subject itself is exotic, esoteric, or whatever names you might want to give it. 
I have been using right along the English texts of Bibles in my research, occasionally, for 
verification I used the French or the Holland Dutch Bible; I abandoned the use of the German Bible 
several years ago since the translations were very poor. 
If I would have used the English version of 1001 Nights I would have failed utterly, but some 
three years ago I had bought at an auction the complete works of 1001 Nights, 4 vol. with some 1600 
pages written in German. I had never opened them, just put them away for “decoration” like others do. 
63
But, when I worked on the Koran of Mohammed I found so many relations and allusions to names that 
I still recalled from childhood having read about them in Oriental Tales printed for children. I took the 
volumes from the bookshelves (good thing I didn't throw them out when I left the East) and began 
reading the first story. The footnote mentioned above told me immediately: Ha, the smart ones belittle 
the old ones. In it I found the same things as Mohammed brought, only in other clothes. After going 
deeper and deeper into it, the Arabian words or rather the names used to call the figures bothered me, 
since some years ago I had taken up the study of Turkish (but then for entirely different purposes) and 
these names were not used in Turkish nor in Arabian, with but few exceptions. There was a coat again. 
I began to speak out loud the names as they are spoken and pronounced in German. I repeated them to 
sort of make them enter my ears. And--- ha, ha, ha. They were mostly German words. Can you beat 
that? Some fellow near Munich who knew the laws must have thought up the idea to make Arabian 
stories, probably knew Arabian besides or had studied Mohammed's stories in the original text, 
translated his own new stories into Arabic, "discovered" them some place as an "Arabian Original" and 
dished them out as such. This fact is so clear and true that I am much surprised German speaking 
scientists have not run onto it. Of course, such statement in fairness to the readers needs an explanation. 
I shall give you here a few examples to show it. I will not use the Bible for illustration, but when you 
realize that we have stories about the "poor" in them, it should be hint enough. 
At this point we must not forget that the Turks were rulers of the entire present Balkan states 
and even came up as far as Vienna. So they were neighbors to Germany and especially to southern 
Germany. I have consulted several sources, which deal about the origin of 1001 Nights. All of them 
have the wrong conception, sorry, but it is so. Why they can entertain their ideas simply shows that they 
don't know the meaning of these stories and take them simply as children's storybooks. However, as I 
studied them, analyzing word for word, I discovered that they couldn’t even be understood by a person, 
who does not know the German language thoroughly, and besides has studied medieval German. The 
reason is this: We have to do with actual substitute words that are purposely misspelled in German 
which give sense as used in the story. Here are a few examples: (I have to quote the German text, since 
in any other language it does not give the idea at all.) We find stories about a "Gries" which word 
means in English "an old man." The right word, which "Gries" should represent is "Kreis" spelled with 
K and not with G and this word means in English: "circle." The stories treat about Zodiacal circles and 
its divisions. Example No. 2: We find stories in which we have to do with "die Armen," in English: "the 
poor." The reading and the story deal with poor people. However, these fellows meant: "die Arme," i.e, 
"the arms" at the end of which we have the hands. Then they use a man by name of "Abi"; this simply 
means in Bavarian slang: down. So, the cycle about which he talks is a down cycle. Later on we find a 
man called "Tagleb," this simply means: Lebtag or the duration of a movement. He also has a man 
called: Mussab, "muss" means in German: it "has to" and "ab" means "down," in other words, the cycle 
must become a down cycle. Then he has, of course, the Kalif, which according to the change of 
consonants (p to f) gives us: Kalb or in English: Calf, an animal we find quoted often in Scriptures and: 
meaning just the same. 
In the stories we meet with two figures: Baba Mustafa and Abu Nuwas. Who were they? They 
were rather important men in their time, as the stories will reveal, but, we must call them “cycles" 
since: Baba Mustafa in the Bavarian dialect means: "Abi, muasstauffa" or: “when you have declined 
you must 'come up again'." In August 1939 Baba Mustafa was working hard in the stock market. 
Abu Nuwas means: "abi and neues," i.e. "down and then a new cycle." Therefore both stories 
are giving us the rules about sharp down moves and the times of recovery. They are different from the 
cycle called ''Mussab'' in which we only go down and stay down in a sidewise movement similar to the 
action of wheat in the Spring of 1936 and late Fall of 1938. 
There are two sisters quoted through out the stories: Shehersad and Dinarsad. The first is 
explaining a condition of a planet "before he sat down" and in German it should be: "sh---ehe er sass" 
64
and Dinarsad means: "die nachher sass" or in English: "the one who sat after him." 
In the story of “History of the poet with Omar” we really get the “lowdown”: It says there in the 
German text: "Weisst Du nicht, dass der Dichter Worte von Dauer und dass ihre Pfeile vergiftet sind?" 
in English: Don't you know that the poets’ words are lasting and that their arrows are poisoned? Let us 
now get the true meaning of this sentence by the right substitution of words: Poet means a writer; i.e. 
the ones who wrote the stories of 1001 Nights; "words" means “rules”; lasting means "true"; arrow 
means "the lines"; poisoned means: "false." Thus we get the true meaning of this sentence. 
Don't you know that the writers’ rules are true, but that the lines written here are false and 
substituted? 
In a story Prince Seif has a Vezier called "Fares" which is nothing but the sign of Aries, so you 
also know now what a Vazier means. 
Of course, our little "Ali Baba" is but a part of the Kalif only that the K and the F are omitted. 
Under the German word Schluessel is meant a "Schuessel"; the one is in English: "Key," while 
the other word means "a bowl." Unless you substitute constantly throughout all works "bowl" whenever 
"key" is used you do not get the correct meaning. 
The word "Ur" used so often means in German "Origin," but this is only for the innocent 
readers; they have omitted purposely the "H" since it should read: UHR or translated: clock. Which 
clock did they mean? Your kitchen clock, or the Zodiac? 
A fellow pops up in the Oriental Tales called: Hussein. Who is he? He is nothing   but: "Haus 
eins" or: the first House. 
Before I bring the copy of a footnote shown in my 1001 Nights, vol. III, page 237, I have to 
bring a few explanations so that you may recognize the absurdity of the writing or explanation the 
translator of the Arab stories gave to his readers "for better understanding."   He says: "The Indian 
Kingdom Bisnagar, on the Indian peninsula, had a very glorious period during the 15th Century and the 
princes of this state seem to have ruled nearly all of Southern India, at least the part south of the River 
Kistna. Portuguese writers call it once in a while Narsinga, which was the name of the mightiest prince 
of the country. The capitol Bisnagar was founded in the middle of the 14th Century on the border of the 
Tongbruda* by two brothers who gave it the name of Vidjaynagara whereof the name Bisnagar came 
later. The kingdom was destroyed in 1564 through coalition of the four Mohammedan Sultans of 
Vizapur, Golkonda, Ahmednagar and Berar. After a battle, in which the Indian Prince was killed, his 
capital fell into the power of the Musulmans which destroyed the entire country and divided it.” 
Let us first recall the big battle that was fought in Genesis, chapter 14 shortly after the Tower of 
Babel was built. Look therein who was who. Next, we go back to medieval German: Bisnagar means: 
"bis nachher|", or after that. Vidjayanagara a German word made to sound like Indian: Wiedernachher 
or: "again after that." The Portuguese called the place Narsinga or: nach dem singen, "after the place 
called song." We must know that only few people are adapted to sing well, the others just crow; their 
planets must have a certain position so as to impart to them that talent. This place is not "Narsinga" but 
just a little ahead of the big city mentioned above. It must also look strange that this city was created 
like the city of Rome, which "they say" was built by Romulus and Remus. Is Rome the same as 
Narsinga? Couldn't be, since one is located in India and the other in Italy. But how about if the writers 
of ancient lore made Italy and India the same place in the Zodiac for convenience sake? That there were 
just exactly four sultans dividing the country according to the footnote must appear strange, when we 
think that there are so many fours in Oriental Tales that we seemingly never know whether they mean 
East, South, West and North, or: conjunction, opposition and squares, or: Ascendant, Mid-heaven, 
Descendent and Nadir?Is Aaron of the Bible the same as Harun (Alraschid)? I did not think 
Mohammedans used Jewish first names? 
As time goes on I realize the difficulty that is facing the publisher of a magazine dealing with 
"movements." Of course, the average magazine never runs out of stuff to produce printed matter; it is 
65
different when we deal with scientific matters where the sole question arises: How can we recognize a 
plus from a minus. Because, after all, we are but interested to learn or find out "does the market move 
up or down” and when do the changes occur. So, all is centering on two small questions.  It is quite 
clear to me now that we can frame our interests into three words: "up or down?" Since in all we know 
there are small tricks behind, which, when unknown, look so intricate to the outsider that he is baffled. 
When experience gradually shows the way, things do not appear as complicated any more and after a 
while, we feel as if we had known the tricks right along.(* "Tongbruda" -  2 brothers! since "bruda" means 
brother.) 
Some of you may have read parts of the Scriptures or all of it. Some may have read now 
Oriental Tales or Fairy stories. I have now found that "each such story" is one complete course of 
astrology. So you can see that the rules can be delivered quite compactly. You have in the Oriental 
Tales three stories of the Kalenders, five stories of the Barbers; they illustrate one single law in several 
forms. The Adam and Eve story (Slavonic Text of Vitae Adae et Evae) is printed in Pseudepigrapha on 
nine pages since on the eighteen pages covering the story we have two versions printed next to each 
other on separate columns. Nine pages give in a concentrated form all the secrets of the Universe, if we 
can read it. 
Of course, to arrive at the point and to visualize that this story is one form in which Laws are 
incorporated takes time and a lot of research in works of many sorts that are not leading to the solution. 
One of the main causes of finding the direction was my love for old books. I always was interested in 
old books and must admit that I have not bought a new book for nearly twenty years, except it were 
reprints in "new cloth" of old works. I always had the feeling the people of long ago knew much more 
than we do and I am as sure as one and one is two that they really did know more than we ever will 
know, although our superior sense makes us feel so far ahead of the savages that had to be cultivated. 
Try the Oriental Tales first by guessing, gradually finding the meaning of one word, then of 
another, until your dictionary is completely covered with as many other meanings as it contains words. 
When doing research work bear in mind that the common verbs, such as read, write, say, talk, go, run, 
walk, etc., are the most difficult to get into their actual meaning. You may fare much easier locating the 
Moon and the Sun or Pharaoh or Mohammed or Ali Baba. In the last issue I gave you the possible 
movements of just one planet and said that we have six more to use. To alleviate your anxiety I just say 
that: go, walk, run, mean about the same, but he who goes is a certain planet and he who walks is 
another and he who runs is again another, so think up a few more words that express a similar motion to 
cover the renaming planets with. 
Stick to one story or version and do not jump from one into another. Work until you can't get 
any further sense out of it; then begin another, until you get into similar difficulties. Keep this up and 
rotate until you have to start again with Adam or with Sheherbad.  By the time ten years have gone by 
you should be very close to the solution of: who is Adam and Eve. You might not be able to get them to 
move around at all; they might persistently stay at one and the same place, but with a lot of imagination 
you can work wonders and suddenly Mr. Adam will walk. As soon as he does he will also speak and 
that is important. Remember that first he was clay and could not walk (it says so) and then he walked 
and talked at the same time.  Of course, "the bone" is a hard one to solve and would leave the bone till 
the very last. You might have erected your temple or your Moschee a long time already and never had a 
soul to go into it or leave it because the figures are very hard to bring to a move. Readers who have 
studied astrology may think different in that they may feel that it just implies the movement of the 
planet but it is not so.

Since a war was begun in Europe on September 1st, 1939 at which point I had an important 
change of trend indicated, it may appear to the average man that my forecasts won't work any more. My 
contention is: this is not so; they will work in fairly close harmony as they did before, only the 
movements should become more intensified, sharper, more volatile in the defined time portions. 
Fortunately, I was able yet to bring in the September issue my article about "protecting Accounts," so 
that, when trouble started and you were wrongly committed you still could jump to the other side. 
As we enter the month of October, we should find ourselves at high levels again. A reaction is 
due as we enter the month; it should last to the 5th or sixth. Then we should turn about face, run up 
sharply again to new high ground, but the day after Columbus Day would lighten off again for a 
reaction to the 19th or 20th. Another spurt is indicated from then on to the 25th-26th, reacting to the 
30th of October. On this day would use weakness to buy back for a run-up into November. 
There appear to be very fine movements in a big trading range with gradually higher levels as 
objective during October. On sharp reactions or sharp run-ups followed by a sidewise movement for a 
day or two without progress, a change of trend can be expected. By this I mean the dates: October 1st to 
2nd, October 5th-6th, October 13 th-15th, October 20th-21st, October 25 th-26th, October 30th-31st.  
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON: 
 
Cotton has come back by September 6th (day of writing) towards the old top of July, making for 
a double top. As we get into October a sharp drop is shown for cotton in that in all probability a large 
surplus of cotton will be again on hand, so that I would sell out long positions at least and only buy 
back towards the end of the month. 
As far as the war is concerned I have no opinion; I consider it as a phenomenon similar to a 
drought or to a pestilence, brought about to prevent commodity prices from going to zero. Everybody 
was pondering for months already how to lift commodity prices; artificial means had very little results. 
Nature achieved it with one single stroke. 
67
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF GRAINS: 
 
The forecast for grains this month is not made the way all previous forecasts were made, but it is 
made according to the findings I have taken out from Aladdin and his lamp. This is very first attempt to 
put the work begun many years ago into practical application. I had to cling so far to rules obtained via 
ordinary astrological laws. We soon will discover how well little Allah can work for us. 
It is suggested that all readers check the performance of grains this month whether they ever 
traded in wheat or not, and compare it with the forecast given. 
The first reaction, beginning as we enter the month October 1st, should amount to about 5 ¼ c 
by October 6th; an up move is then indicated till October 19th; the number of points upward should 
amount to about 19c; an irregular lower market should then begin with big volume, just below the top 
in a 3½ - 4c range. The last day (October 24th) should bring a break through the lows and we should 
lose an extra 2c that day. The 24th should be the low, having lost altogether from the peak made 
October 19th, 1939, about 6¾ c. After that a sharp rally is shown crossing the highs of October 19th   
by ¾c, reacting 4 ¼ c by the 31st of the month. This day should be a low point.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT TAKEN FROM 1001 NIGHTS 
 
In the story of Sinbad, just where he begins to make his first trip it says: "A high rank is reached 
according to one's efforts. He who wants to climb up has to walk through many a night. He who desires 
pearls has to dive into the depth of the Sea; only then can he acquire reputation and wealth. But he who 
desires results and riches without putting all his power into operation, loses his life in wishes that never 
will be fulfilled." 
Part of the story of the blind Baba Abdallah: Abdallah, born in Bagdad, his parents died while 
he was young and left a small fortune to him. He did not waste this money like many of his age do; he 
used his efforts trying to increase it, thinking day and night on ways and means to accomplish the task. 
He became rich so that he owned 80 camels, which he rented to caravan merchants. 
One day in the midst of his fortune, wishing to become still richer than he was now, he met a 
dervish who walked towards Basrah. They talked together and had dinner. During the meal nothing of 
importance was spoken, but finally the dervish said, he knew of a place of large riches containing much 
more gold and diamonds than his 80 camels could possibly carry. He felt that the dervish wasn't fooling 
when he said it. He kissed him and said: "Good derwish, I know that you don't pay much attention to 
worldly goods; what can such knowledge do you any good? You are alone and can't take much of it; 
show me where the fortune can be found - I shall load my 80 camels and shall even make you a present 
of one camel, showing this way my appreciation, friendship and pleasure." 
This was a pretty cheap offer, but the devil of money madness had entered my heart as soon as 
the dervish spoke of the treasure, so that I even felt I had offered him too much (1 out of 80); the 79 
appeared like nothing compared to the one I offered him. The dervish didn't mind the offer. "Brother," 
he said to me very quietly, you know that the proportion of the offer is all out of gear compared to the 
service I am rendering you. I wouldn't have had to say a word about the treasure and could keep it for 
myself what I told you of my own volition; you can consider this as proof that I am willing to do you 
some good and to help you." "You say," said the derwish further, you have 80 camels. I am ready to 
bring you to the treasure house and load them with as much gold and precious stones as they can carry. 
However, when they are packed you have to give me half of your camels including their load; then we 
shall part and each one can go his way. You see this division is fair; since, when you give me 40 
camels, I procure so much money that you can buy a thousand others for it. " I couldn't deny that the 
conditions sounded reasonable. Without considering the many riches which I could take in by 
accepting, I considered the separation of half of my camels a big loss and the thought to make the 
dervish rich was not at all to my liking. In short, right in advance, I rewarded a voluntary beneficial 
offer with strange feelings before ever receiving it. There was not much time to think the situation over; 
either I had to accept the offer, else I might have felt sorry all my life to have passed up the opportunity 
to acquire a big fortune. 
Immediately I gathered all the camels and we went together. The dervish brought me to the 
place and we found much gold and precious stones. I rushed like mad at the gold heaps; the dervish, 
however, picked the precious stones, being worth much more than the gold. We loaded all and had to 
leave much behind for want of bags, and camels. Before we left the dervish went to some vase and took 
from it a small wooden box and put it in his pocket. He closed the treasure place again the way he had 
opened it and the rock appeared as be fore. We divided the camels, 40 each. I took the first 40, the 
dervish the last 40. We went back the way we came and wanted to separate, the dervish to go to Basrah 
and I to go to Bagdad. I thanked him for his favors to have just chosen me to take part in such fortune. 
After a few steps the devil entered my heart; envy took hold of me. I could not stand the loss of the 40 
camels loaded with treasures. I said to myself: "The dervish does not need all this fortune; he has this 
treasure house constantly at his disposal and can take as much as he wants to. I decided to get my 
70
camels back together with the treasures. I ran back toward him, made a sign, and he stopped. I said: 
"Brother, you are a nice fellow, used to a quiet life without worldly care and you have nothing else to 
do but serve God. You may not realize what burden you take over by going away with so many camels. 
I suggest, take but 30 of them, even this amount will cause you enough hardship." The dervish said: "I 
think you are right; you better take ten of them back." I counted the ten carefully and put them to my 
own camels. Having seen how easy it was to get ten camels away from the dervish my desire to get 
more was heightened. Instead of thanking I said: "Brother, I am worrying too much about your quiet 
mode of living that I could leave you without explaining carefully that a man not used to handling such 
big business is apt to worry. It would be much better if you would make me another gift like the one 
you just made. You see, I am not saying this to benefit myself, rather to relieve you from tremendous 
worries. Let me have ten more of your camels. I can handle 100 camels as well as one." This speech 
had its effect; now I had 60 and he had but 20 camels. I should have been satisfied by now. But I was 
like one who had dysentery; the more he drinks the more water he wants. Thus I went about to get the 
balance of the camels too. Finally I got ten and finally the last ten also. I thanked him and kissed him. 
All he said was: "Make good use of it, and remember, that God can take the fortune away as easy as he 
bestowed it on us. I must have been blind; I was not even satisfied with the 80 camels but wanted also 
the small wooden box he had picked up from the vase. I said: "I noticed you picked up a small box 
containing a salve. What did you want to do with that? It seems worthless; it is not even worthwhile to 
take that along. The salve that is in it you never will use since you, as a dervish have no use for a hair 
solve The dervish said: "Here, brother, is the salve box so that nothing is missing; I want to see you 
satisfied. If I still can do something else for you, just say so; I shall do just what you want." I took the 
box, opened it, examined the salve and said: "Since you do so much for me, won't you be kind enough 
to explain me what I shall do now with this salve?" He said: " When you put a little bit of this salve 
over your left eye, you will see all the treasures hidden in the earth; but, if you rub the salve over your 
right eye, you will become blind immediately." I wanted to experiment myself with the wonder salve; 
so I handed the dervish the salve and said: "Put it around my left eye; you know that better than I do.”  I 
hardly could wait to see the results. The effect was great: "I saw immediately immense amounts of 
treasures in houses. I had kept my right eye closed with my hand during all this time and since this 
annoyed me after a while I said to the dervish: "Smear some salve on my right eye now. " He said: "I 
shall oblige, but remember, if you do get this salve on your right eye, you will become immediately 
blind. This salve has this sort of effect and you are warned ahead of time. " I thought he was fooling me 
and that some other secret was hidden behind it and said: "Brother, you are kidding.  How could it be 
possible that the salve has two kinds of effect?" "You can believe me, since I never hold back the 
truth,” said the dervish. I did not trust the dervish. I insisted, believing that if the salve has the property 
to make me see fortunes when applied to the left eye, it might have as effect when applied to the right 
eye to make me possessor of all this vast wealth.  "After having done so much good to you, brother, I 
cannot decide to bring you ill fortune now,” said the derwish. "Remember how sad it is when one loses 
his eye sight and you would be sorry all your life." But I did not stop pestering him. Finally he applied 
the salve to the right eye - immediately I became blind I cursed the derwish;  "What you said is but too 
true.” 
Now then, you were kind to me and all, but, don't you know of a secret that would now give me back 
my eyesight? The dervish said; "I have no such salve; the only one who could help is the almighty god; 
he gave you all the wealth of which you proved unworthy; now he took it again and will hand it over to 
people who are not as unworthy as you are.” 
Try and figure this out; several readings may be necessary to grasp piece by piece; the latter part 
is very enlightening in that it means: Baba Abdallah didn't see the big burst coming such is we had in 
1929 in October. He must have bought the last moment when US Steel hit 262 1/4.

LET'S HAVE THE TRUTH 
 
PART III 
 
Thijl Uilenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak, a book dealing with conditions in Flanders around the 
years 1530-1590, is another Law Book dealing with motions of the Universe. It is called the Flemish 
Bible. Incidentally I ran across it in my library when I was looking up the Crusades of the Middle Ages 
of which there were seven, the same as there are 7 Heavens and 7 Earths according to the Scriptures. 
These Crusades “smell” very much like "Complete works of how to figure events due to come." 
Unfortunately I have no old book available, as yet, that would give the 7 Crusades in one story. The 
new works of present day historians won't help any since the wording has been changed and in the 
wording and the exact joining of thoughts only can the laws be recognized.  Anyhow, in my desperation 
to check up on the Crusades I came across a 5 volume set, "History of the City of   Frankfurt on Main. I 
saw therein that 1 Frankfort up to around 1300 was a village like Carmel, that no historic data of any 
consequence are available prior to   the year 1320; besides, there was a note saying that the people of 
that time liked to live singly and not together in cities, which accounts for the lack of cities. The 
Encyclopedia says that in the first Crusade 400,000 men, led by kings were taken down to the Holy 
Land to clean it out of Unbelievers. The Crusades were supposed to have started in 1095, when Pope 
Urban II held a council at Clermont. They are supposed to have ended with the fall of Acca in 1291, 
lasting therefore 196 years. We find Crusades made by the English King, by the French king, by the 
German king; even the Dutch king went down. Italy and Spain belonged at that time to Germany or 
Germany belonged to Spain or Italy. 
I personally believe that there never were any Crusades but the initiated used this sort of idea to 
explain their laws of motions. The same applies to the story of Thijl Uilenspiegel. It is all invention 
pure and simple as a cover for what they actually have to say--another 1001 Nights. What makes me 
feel bad now is the idea that in my school days we spent nearly a year learning all about the Crusades in 
the history class! 
 
Let us analyze Thijl Uilenspiegel roughly. He is a roamer going from place to place (in all the 
Scriptures we have them). He committed a sin and had to go to Rome to be absolved of it. Afterwards 
he comes back to Flanders and tries to rid that country of Spanish rule, of the Inquisition and of 
Catholic influence. He has a companion, Lamme, who is his double; the latter is fat, Uilenspiegel is thin 
and tall. They crack jokes everywhere. These jokes are "the laws; they believe him to be crazy; at times 
they don't know that he is fooling them right and left. In my German text is found a lot of Dutch words 
and sentences, also French and Latin, things which just cannot be translated. The writer was seemingly 
German who knew Dutch perfectly. Although using the Dutch language throughout, his mind runs in 
German and not in Dutch. One joke shows it clearly and many others too numerous to relate do the 
same.  When we read the sentence about the place where Lamme, one of the figures of the story, lives 
(vol.1, page 103 my edition), it says: "They came to the house of Lamme who lived at the Pont-des-
Arches." For the reader this should mean "Bridge of the Arcs," but in French there is no word which is 
called in singular "Arche" or in plural "Arches;" however, there is a German word pronounced the 
French way that covers the actual meaning, especially if we call the French word ''Pont'' (bridge) merely 
"the point" or "the center"......Catch on? (Please apply this also to the Ark of Noah and you'll get 
places.) So his friend Lamme, which is nothing but the "Lamb" of the Scriptures and "lame" (lahm in 
German), lives at a rather dark and strange place, especially, since in the next sentence it says: "a one-
eyed maid opened the door. "You see, in astrology all sorts of places have to be treated, explained and 
used. He actually was locating at that time the November 13th low of 1929. He knew about that low 
nearly 400 years ago. 
72
Uilenspiegel, the coal-dealer's son, without schooling, using the language as he does, fitting idea 
to idea, jumping from one top to the next bottom and to the top again, going through gardens and rivers, 
into castles and inns is following so closely the 1001 Arabian stories in action and effect that only a 
blind man fails to see this. He is always in need of an assistant, Lamme, else, he can't act right. The 
same phenomenon we find when we analyze the Scriptures. The main figures always have an assistant 
too. Moses needs Aaron etc. 
He also says (page 90 vol.1): "What is worth less than a bursted bladder? A secret given out." 
This same rule is mentioned often in the Scriptures, also the 1001 Night stories. 
As the story runs on we find a " rosary of bottles" the same as we find the ghosts in Oriental 
Tales quite often bottled up. Heavens, I am giving you hints enough now to discover the basis of 
astrological laws. I am repeating and repeating to make you see. Can't you draw some of those bottles 
and recognize them as a typical movement? Can't you see the Church now where Uilenspiegel is carried 
into and gets baptized six times; can't you see the father and the mother standing straight up in front of 
the bowl with the big hole and the mason at the ceiling who pours down the water? 
 This Uilenspiegel story being one single continued story, which contains the necessary 
astrological laws, appears to me easier to understand than all the others. It seems to be one of the most 
recent ones incorporating all the laws. There were many smart people in times past who had it over all 
of us; when they once knew the laws of Nature all they did for pastime was to think up stories and work 
into them the laws with proper substitutions. I want to retract at this time a statement made previously, 
saying that I consider it very difficult to write stories of that kind that fit the laws. I believe now it can 
be easily done when the laws are once fully known. Since he who knows will never deviate from the 
truth, he will frame his words and sentences constantly alike when ex- pressing one and the same idea. 
I now can understand much better why such lovely sweet stories could be written; all stories 
explain effects of planets. All stories begin at one and the same point and run through one complete 
cycle until it starts to repeat once more at the point of beginning. The laws applying the same way in 
each sub-cycle, it is but a matter of changing persons, surroundings, subjects; in that rivers and 
mountains men and women baths, beards, eyes and ears are available anywhere, they have no difficulty 
to use them in the stories and make things sound true and logical. 
It appears to me as if 1001 Nights and Thijl Uilenspiegel are easy Grammars to work into the 
subject. The Ta1mud is the book of Syntax, the correct book of exact rules and of its exceptions. The 
pseudepigraphic works are essays of various sorts and the Scriptures are the regular, approved 
handbooks. 
I wish to mention in reference to 1001 Nights, that the 4th vol. of my edition must have been 
written by entirely different persons than the first three volumes. The arrangement of thoughts, the 
expressions are completely different than in the former portions. The same I noticed several years ago 
in the Bible; I could follow the drift of things fairly well then until I reached the Kings; of Jeremiah I 
could not translate one word. These parts must have been written by entirely different people whose 
thoughts did not react on my own astral body favorably. 
Thijl Uilenspiegel is actually a Dutch or Flemish work and if you should try to study it, obtain a 
Dutch dictionary for examination of words given in original Dutch, which cannot be given in another 
language. Since Dutch was one of my first languages to master, I had no difficulty to pick up quickly 
the underlying idea of given Dutch words---as stated long ago, it is all a matter of substitution, not only 
in ideas such as "father" being equal to "courage, " but in the shading of the words itself. For example I 
may say: "the sap begins its flow at the root of the tree; however, the saps in the stock market begin to 
buy at the top of the tree. " Changing this for i1lustration' s sake, I may say: "Saps begin to flow on both 
ends of the nut tree." If you would find such a sentence in a story you would quickly say: "there is a 
mistake somewhere," and keep on reading your story as long as the story continues giving a fair sense. 
But, a lot of valuable information is contained in this apparently twisted sentence. 
73
All the works treated right along are made up of sentences and substitutes like the one modeled 
above as an illustration for you. 
I have not read an English version of Thijl Uilenspiegel. If you do hunt for one, take a complete 
edition and use an original issue. It may be printed years ago or it may be a recent reprint of an old text, 
as long as it is a good translation. No use expecting you to learn now quickly Holland Dutch, since last 
month you might have started on medieval German. By this sentence I just wish to bring forth the idea 
what fields have to be entered and entered in a hurry, getting away from thoughts of India and Mecca 
and walk along with Uilenspiegel through Flemish villages and live with thoughts and ideas of the 
Flemish people which fortunately I had done many years ago. 
This is as far as I can go, else "the bladder might burst" I have given you in these six issues 
enough material on hand to continue. Bible, 1001 Nights, Thijl Uilenspiegel, and other subjects 
pertaining to show the way to truth are not going to be touched any more from now on. This is the end 
and it is 72 pages, the same as Time Factors" had 72 pages without knowing at that time the reason why 
it required 72 pages. I do now. 
To clear out the remnants of "Time Factors," 7 Lessons in Astrology, and of "Bible Lessons," 
they'll go for the next 30 days for $5.00 a copy; if they don't go, they'll go to the Pont-des-Arches to 
Lamme. None will be available after that time. 
No renewal for expired subscriptions to Preview is solicited nor accepted. 
 
WE LIVE IN A FUNNY WORLD 
 
In the September issue I said something about people trying to be more than they really are (girl 
with polished nails, applicant applying for a. job). 
We have many other cases where this is shown well. 
Take the moving pictures. Pictures of royal scenes, of cannibal life made right in the heart of 
Los Angeles, Calif., make the movie fans weep for joy, cry for pity about the man who is in danger. 
They are carried in their minds way off from their own trodden path, from their normal planetary 
movement into a planetary movement which is not their own, but which belongs to somebody else. 
Theatres are the same type of make belief. Once I went to see Aida in the New York 
Hippodrome. This is what I lived through. First of all, Aida being an Egyptian piece does not very well 
fit into our present life. So while going over to see it I made up my mind to think strictly of pyramids, 
ancient Pharaohs, mummies, tombs, etc. When the curtain rose I saw an "Egyptian Room" whose walls 
were of painted cloth, the wind from back stage blew the walls and sort of "inflated" them on and off, 
things did not fit any more, the figures playing tried their best to keep their Egyptian physiognomies, 
but when the first act was over I had enough. The "Make-belief" was not even able to "make-me-
belief." 
When in 1930 and 1931 we found ourselves in a major bear market, one of the New York 
newspapers started a make believe campaign by printing underneath each article the following verse: 
"Buy now." "Buy now," suggesting to the readers to take advantage of the present prices and buy 
because things are cheap. They were rather high then, since we dropped headlong into an abyss. When 
the abyss was reached strange to say, I do not recall that this slogan was printed any more then, because 
at that time people had spent their money already. They tried their best to stem the tide, but why it 
didn't work we know. The time was not ready. 
Trips and travels are another sort of "make belief."   When in the summer we get away from 
business, we enter temporarily a new world, we "see things" that actually do not belong to "our" world.  
 
74
We see strange, exotic people, strange habits methods of doing things, which do not at all agree 
with our own ideas since they belong to some other world (each nation or country we may consider as a 
world of its own). 
When we get back we feel some sort of relief to be back "home," i.e. in our own world. 
Everything looks so "real" at home so actual and known that we are glad to be once more "in our own 
cycle." 
In Germany, I recall, the boys after having gone through school take up trade, pay a goodly sum 
to be allowed to work there for three years as an apprentice. After those three years have passed, they 
become what is called a "Geselle" or one who should know the rudiments of the trade. Immediately 
thereafter these young men take the road, traveling through the country, working here and there to make 
a living. In doing so they gain experience of all sorts, how things of this trade are done here and there. 
Some may stay at a place and settle; most of them however after a year or two find their way back 
"home" to stay and establish themselves in business. The events that happen to them during this 
traveling are talked about all their life when they sit together. Some add to the stories, others omit 
certain unpleasant experiences, but they live through everything a hundred times. It is their world of 
"make-belief." 
One very interesting case illustrating the gradual increase of "make belief" a person, or persons 
are subject to, which, in due time they even take as actuality or as an actual fact is this one:  
Many years ago I lived in a western city. Friends lived down the block. One evening, around 6 
p.m., I went over to them to take home my wife whom I thought was visiting there. Coming up the 
stairs I knocked at the door (it was an apartment house). The friend's wife answered, "Who is there?", 
an expression I never liked to hear but which I heard there so often. That was enough. I knew if my 
wife had been there she just simply would have opened the door to look who was there. Anyhow, I 
quietly retreated and went home. My wife had been visiting some other friends and had reached home 
in the meantime. 
Now here comes the "make belief." The lady, a normal, intelligent and refined type told her 
husband that evening that some man came to the door and tried to get into her apartment. He 
immediately got his gun ready, loaded it, so that, if need be, she could shoot it out with the intruder. He 
told me all about the event the next morning but I "acted" (seemingly for your benefit now to illustrate 
something of great importance 25 years later) as surprised inquiring about the facts of how this 
happened. That lady saw how her husband loaded the gun and gradually picked up courage, pictured 
herself holding that gun and shooting at the intruder "were he to come again." 
So, that evening I went over to them, heard the story "first hand" from the lady. The story had 
already become bigger than the one I heard from her husband. The door was pushed hard, the fellow 
outside demanded that she open the door and that she was going to call the police etc., etc. 
Years went by and I never revealed to them that innocently I had come to the door to look for 
my wife. I had not said a word; else she would have recognized my voice. On and off I saw them and 
when the moment was opportune, I asked her to tell me the story of the burglar, as she termed the caller 
for quite some time. The event was always more and more enlarged; she finally, two years ago, when I 
happened to visit again, said: she had to pull the trigger and he was wounded but made a get-away even 
at that. 
Last year I saw her again and had her tell the story. But it grew so big and she pictured herself 
as such a big heroine that I had to stop it and said "Clara, dear, it was me and you didn't know that for 
fully twenty-five years. 
There are many traders in stocks or commodities who watch a certain stock. It may be a cub. 
They like it, watch it, but don't buy it; they have the feeling it is a good stock; but this is as far as they 
go. This cub grows in price and they see it grow, but wouldn't buy it since it "might have a reaction." 
Finally the stock or the price of that commodity becomes a monster. It is then so big that they say: Now 
75
I have to take you and they buy it right there when it has outgrown itself, i.e. when it is on the top. The 
stock is so lively and vivid, so active and lovely that they hug it and pet it, tell others about it until--- 
Nature says: Clara it was but me, or, in other words, the Time cycle of inflating is over; the stock grows 
"thin," it reacts on small volume and before they realize, it is a cub again, even less than a cub--- the 
water is taken out of it, the skeleton is left, the bare value. The trader may say to the stock: How nice 
and fat you were, but how thin are you now! Remember the story of Red Riding Hood and the Witch.  
In this last sentence is hidden an important secret about planetary motion. Think about the fat and lean 
years of Egypt while you are at it! 
 
WORTH KNOWING 
 
There is a rule with a certain broker (it may be a general rule of the Chicago Board of Trade) 
that if you buy single lots of wheat, you have to sell them singly and not as full contracts. Supposing 
you buy two lots today and three lots tomorrow (one lot is 1000 bushels), you cannot sell them as a full 
contract, although a full contract constitutes 5000 bushels. This is what happened to a trader (B.G.) who 
never toughed anything else but wheat up to the time where the case happened. After suggesting to him 
about eight weeks ago to buy some cotton, he calls up his broker, to buy five lots of cotton. 
Unfortunately his regular customers' man was not there when the call came in, the one next to him took 
the order without bothering about the size of his account which runs around $1200.00. This man rushed 
over to place the order, it was executed and everything was hunky-dory until the next morning the 
uninitiated cotton trader got a margin call for $1700.00.  Cotton unfortunately sold off some ten points 
during that day and he had bought five full contracts of that cotton, since there are no single lots of 
cotton traded. The margin required for this amount was $2500.00 and, since cotton did sell off ten 
points besides, the margin clerk felt like he should rub it in good and well to him for having the nerve to 
buy that much cotton with such little margin. 
This was an accident and not one of the so-called "chance plays" when you can once in a while 
get the best of the margin clerk for a few hours. 
Watch what you buy and know what the trading units are. 
 
CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM RESEARCH MADE 
DURING THE SUMMER OF 1939 
 
1. The movements of markets are subject to planetary motions only, so that propaganda, one way 
or the other, restrictions one way or the other, wars, droughts, pestilence which, in themselves 
are nothing but the effects of planetary motions, wheels within wheels, influence markets only 
the way Nature requires it. 
2. We, ourselves have nothing to say about it. 
3. Our lives are but one card of a serves of many decks. 
4. Motions cannot be controlled, but they can be figured the way they are due to come and to 
develop. 
5. The laws of how to figure movements of any particular think alive, are contained in hundreds of 
ancient works, such as the Bible, the Myths, the Fabled 1001 Nights, Decameron, the Egyptian 
"Book of the Dead," the Talmud and Al Koran. 
6. The way these books have been worked up they appear as innocent so called religious books. It 
76
is said they are "open books" and therefore they can be understood if one takes off the veil. 
7. My conclusion from the research made so far points toward the following: All these works were 
"Made in Ger many" between the years 800 and 1 500 or even a little later. The fundamental 
laws might have been known by ancient nations possibly 1000 or more years be fore, but only at 
the above given period have they been put into story forms. 
8. Common methods of astrology never get anyone towards the solution. Ali Baba says in the story 
of the 40 Thieves: "Their (the traders) methods were used to make profits, but for such 
undertakings (of solving the puzzle of motion), one has to approach it in a clever and strange 
way. 
9. Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves is the complete work of: How to figure wheat movements. At the 
end of the story he says: "(Since he now understands the rules, what the actual meaning of each 
word should be, what planets are meant, what type of motion is used, how the movement occurs 
in the Zodiac, where the actual beginning of a cycle starts and when it HAS to repeat, etc.) Now 
he doubted no more that he was the only one in the world who knew the secret of how to open 
the Cavern so that the entire treasures contained   therein were completely at his disposal." This 
is quite a broad statement to make. But I can see it that way myself. The whole story comprises 
but 28 pages and contains under cover all that is to be known about wheat prices for any time, 
any year, any month or day, clearly though concisely written. 
10. The idea of substituting words for other words so as to cover up the actual meaning sounds 
strange to the average man. However, it must have been the greatest art with these writers, much 
greater than the actual finding of the laws. Because, when you realize it is but the question of 
simple line' s movement and they were able to write a wonderful story about it that makes you 
feel like being in Fairy Land, such work is marvelous. 
11.  On the other hand, the way some people feed the public these stories and the way the public 
does take them is just as marvelous and unbelievable. The joke of it all is that neither of the 
parties knows what it is all about, and they never will know nor even try to know. We just find 
in this condition another law of the Universe. 
12. When you read over the various articles produced in these six volumes of Preview, you will 
notice that we covered an immense field. Most of it had to do with hidden secrets, where and 
how to get a hold of them, how to tackle them patiently and persistently. We have not touched 
on dividends, nor on car-loadings; we have not bothered about the electric out-put for the month 
nor about the rain of yesterday in the Middle West. We just simply have ignored 
EVERYTHING upon which the average trader pins his deductions and his hopes of arriving at 
the conclusion: is the market a buy or a sale. If these writings have brought you only as far as to 
say: the common approaches of traders to judge markets are valueless or very nearly so, then 
your investment shows big profits already. That the common way is more believable hitches on 
the same laws as I give in point 11 above and therefore don't need repetition. 
13. The writers of our texts MUST HAVE worked with charts, not only with one chart that of 
planetary motions but with actual charts of the daily high and low prices of commodities. This is 
clearly indicated and visible. They knew all about gaps up-gaps and down, gaps. They even tell 
how to determine the time when they are due to come. On page 24 I explained all about 
commodity charts. 
14. The number of twisted German words mentioned in last month's issue have increased greatly 
during my research this past month; my reductions have proved absolutely correct since they fit 
each place wherever they repeat in stories whether in 1001 Nights, Bible or Midrash, and 
ALWAYS mean the same thing. Having just now the book of 1001 Nights before me, I notice 
without searching for a special case right on the opened page, vol. III, 225: The story of Ali 
Baba and the 40 Thieves ends when the captain of the Thieves takes the name of: Chogia 
77
Husein. This "Husein" I said in the last issues, means: "Haus eins" or: "House No. 1." The story 
that follows is entitled: "History of Ali Chodjah, Merchant of Bagdad." Here we find "Chogia," 
the captain of the Thieves with another name, i.e.,"Chodjah." (LAUTVERSGHIEBUNG change 
of consonants.) Therefore, it is but another name covering the previous one. And there are 
people in this world who think them to be silly fables of the Orient.. The Mohamedanization of 
the Bavarian dialect words or of medieval German words is another art these writers understood. 
What fun they must have had when they wrote the stories for future students. They might have 
often said ''Now, let's see, how shall we say now: go and find a name for that aspect, go and find 
a city for this top; but don't go all over creation for it take one that SOUNDS believable for the 
masses.. Another one might have said; Let us call profit "salt" which I found to mean just that. 
The translator of 1001 Nights from Arabian back into the original tongue, from which it grew, 
says in a footnote, vol. III, page 221: "Salt indicated by the ancients the symbol of friendship 
and trust (he hits that pretty well); they used it in all their offering and alliances.(Not bad ). 
Beduins and Arabs of the desert considered it the symbol of trust and indicating the inviolance 
of their treaties. They had greater respect of nothing but of bread and salt. If they once have 
eaten with a man (Can you see now what is meant by man?) bread and salt, it would be a terrible 
crime to rob him or his baggage or merchandise, etc. (He brings another 20 lines of his thoughts 
to explain away the fact that salt in the Scriptures simply does mean everything but "profit." Let 
him be happy with his ideas, but we use ours, which is the true meaning. 
15. It seems to me as if the Scriptures and similar writing never had been intended for the public; 
they were not meant to be "Sacred Writings" but "Secret Writings." They may be termed "Code 
messages" for a few, and "Code messages" for all the rest. A Code message is decipherable for a 
few; undecipherable for all the others and for both it is a Code Message. 
16. I know there are some readers who are going to follow carefully all the suggestions made in 
these articles both for training and for personal research. I also feel sure that in this present era 
planetary positions are such that one or the other of the many readers will find the true 
beginning and build on it. Fade-outs will occur frequently; but one of these fade-outs new 
phoenix-like ideas will come forth until such time as the correct substitutions have been found. 
Then everything will click from Adam over to Amen. 
 
SPEND YOUR OWN MONEY 
 
Something happened today in Salinas, Calif., where I went with the boss, to buy a school dress, 
for the girl. The purpose of making an example of this common procedure is to convey to you certain 
ideas that may be helpful in trading or in life generally. 
A lot of my readers who know us from New York or those who have passed a few hours with us 
while traveling through here this summer re call that my boss is very picky, exact and careful. It is hard 
to put one over on her. I recognized this fact long ago. Anyhow, we went to a store to buy a dress. She 
had apparently figured out for a week already which kind she wanted, the price she was ready to pay, 
the color, the style, the fabric and whatever things must be considered when one wants a certain dress. 
She went to that department, went right to the individual sections to select roughly the color of the 
dress, rejecting of the first batch most of them except one which she took off, looked at it and placed it 
back. Then she went to the second batch, glanced at them, touched a few, picked two and laid them 
aside. Then she went to the sweater section in that something must have come into her mind that 
sweaters might be more appropriate. At the place she had been standing she could not see the sweater 
section since it was in the far corner. She left everything and looked over some ten or twelve sweaters 
78
and I got sick and tired from looking and went down to the car to work on my Ali Baba, which for 
safety's sake I had taken along. I was so engrossed in my work that I did not notice that two hours had 
gone by at the time she came and all she had bought was six stencils, which I need to make letters. The 
sales girls (customers' men) who were after her to suggest this and that, to praise this design and that 
color retired in disgust because she just said "I am just looking." They were not leaders at all, since they 
could not in duce her to buy what they wanted to sell her, but she kept her own way about it and did not 
buy since nothing to her liking was available. She has her will because she knows just what she wants 
and would not take "similar" for it. So she rather does without it. 
When trading, you must act the same way. You must make up your mind way ahead that you 
want this stock or wheat or rubber about a certain time, when according to your mind the price is right. 
Supposing you are waiting for U. S. Steel to reach a certain price and you go to the broker to buy it; 
don't let him sell you some other stock instead. If you can't get U. S. Steel and get it at the price you felt 
was the right price, go home and do without it! This is such an important rule that I had to bring it in 
picture form (like an Oriental Tale). The entire story could have been said in a few words: Spend your 
own money. Most people use sales people to have them spend their money. A salesman who gets a hold 
of a "good prospect"(my boss is a very poor prospect) can sell him everything under the sun, just like 
some people sell astrological books and call them Oriental Tales. 
 
DO YOU KNOW? 
An egg is our number 0, the beginning of all thinks. Just check an astronomical ephemeris and 
see how often important movements begin in all sorts of stocks or commodities when a planet reaches 
the "egg" in declination or latitude, or even in longitude! WHAT SHOULD 1940 BRING? Forecasts

FORECAST MARKET MOVEMENTS FOR NOVEMBER 
 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO:   
The strength displayed in stocks during October should still be present as we enter the month. 
Let us expect a continuation of the strength at least up to Election Day, to be more explicit, until 
November 7th. From that time I expect a sharp reaction to develop in stocks. It should not be the 
beginning of a bear market but rather be an expression of thoughts about the results of the elections. 
Temporary profits should therefore be accepted Election Day with a view to replace the positions 
between November 15th and 20th for another spurt upward. Fast traders may want to lighten once more 
on the old Thanks giving date and wait with buying stocks back until we have entered the month of 
December. By Thanks giving we most likely have regained a little more than half the losses sustained 
from the E1ection results. 
In that there will be no more issues of Preview, readers whose subscriptions expire with this 
issue are invited to take a subscription to my weekly analysis and, as far as I can judge, it will be well 
worth the little extra expense; others, whose subscriptions have to run another six months, will be 
properly taken care of either by direct refund, if desired, or by a suitable forecast on the 20th of the 
month similar to those contained herein but without articles. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
The forecast of wheat for the month of November is again made with the new method, this time 
I use Ali Baba and his forty Thieves. According to my interpretation "thieves" means profit hunters. 
Their captain means "the trader"; this month they should be out for a lot of thievery and they should say 
on November 11th to12th: "Sesame (wheat), open the doors," because I expect a gap upward at that 
time and a run to produce profits the balance of the month. A small reaction is shown from November 
and down to the 5th or 6th, followed by a slow comeback, whereby it should appear as if the bottom 
might drop out most any moment, but then instead of a drop we should be due for the gap and the run. 
The up move should continue until the end of the month at which time would take in the sails 
temporarily for rather wide fluctuations sidewise are indicated to lead us into the month of December. 
But, the last week of November should not yet become the high point for wheat and it should be 
taken as a period of temporary profit taking by some of the "thieves" the way Ali Baba calls the bull 
traders. 
Be it said yet, that the stories I am speaking of constantly are giving only important movements 
and not one has pointed as yet to divulge small "jiggles.

So why should we attempt to even think of trading for day-to-day movements and of methods 
"to get wiped out in a hurry"?  
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF COTTON.
Cotton has followed the forecast for October but in such a narrow range that it is hardly 
noticeable as yet (Oct.11th). The month of November indicates a rise for the first ten days and a 
reaction back to about the same levels as when the month begins. However, like with stocks, the price 
of cotton has moved up slowly though steadily so far this year. The stick upward made on Sept. 10th, 
1939, and the subsequent gap down the day after (Sept. 11th, 1939) indicates from chart reading to me 
that we should play in this zone for a while, precluding thus a drop below the Sept. 1st level as well as a 
passing of the 10c level in most options; I rather would consider cotton as moving in a big trading range 
of two hundred points: 8.00 - 10.00 with an intermediate resistance at the 8.70 level (NY cotton and 
December option is used). Action should be taken at either end for the contrary side and a gap, which 
could develop on the road, can be followed immediately to the zones of resistance indicated just now. I 
consider cotton moderately bullish.

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION IN THE INTEREST OF 
STOCKS AND COMMODITY TRADERS. 
 
All statements made in this publication are George Bayer’s personal opinion.  They are based upon 
apparent recurring cycles of time and price.  The forecasts given herein, while made with the utmost 
care, are not guaranteed. 
 
HAPPINESS, HEALTH AND MONEY 
 
I have noticed in some magazines that they give the "reading time" for various stories they 
bring. I shall give you here also the "reading time" for this special article so that you can benefit 
accordingly: Please take two quiet hours for the first readings one and one-half hours for the second 
reading the day after (allowing 24 hours for thoughts). A week later read it just once more. 
The well being of people is shown in three ways, through happiness, or satisfaction, through 
health and through money. They are three separate entitles the same as longitude, declination and 
latitude are in space. 
We can lead a very nice and useful life when one of these three apparent essentials is weak so to 
say; we may have lots of money and good health but little happiness with it; we may have happiness 
and plenty of health such as most hoboes possess, but be without funds; we also find cases where there 
is plenty of money, as well as happiness, but poor health. 
In mathematics we distinguish height, width and breadth. In bodies many times one of these 
essential parts is completely weak. Things might have height but very little of the other "virtues" as 
exemplified by a needle. A thing might have width but hardly any height or breadth, such as is the case 
with the leaves of the deciduous trees. The idea astrologically is simply this: Nature just could not have 
a leaf of a plane tree an inch thick, nor could the tailor use spikes to sew clothes.  In other words, to 
illustrate the idea better, unless a thing (anything) has a certain longitude, latitude and declination, it 
would not be that thing at all If the fixed star Sirius would not remain in its latitude and right ascension 
it would not be the fixed star Sirius any more. The same way when Venus rises in the morning before 
the Sun we call it the "Morning Star'', but, after a while when it contacts the Sun, we discard this name. 
Venus then has no name for people since it can't be seen except for the few who need this planet 
constantly to figure out market movements. After a few months people recognize Venus again in the 
sky but call it now the "Evening Scar" since it sets later than the Sun. We note therefore three "phases" 
for Venus as observed by people in general. The effect of Venus upon the market in each of these three 
phases is so different that it will surprise you. When a planet is near the Sun we say: ''it is burnt by the 
Sun." This is a rather clever saying. At that time the Sun is so powerful in respect to the planet Venus 
that it seemingly does away with Venus and Venus is not Venus anymore, but becomes a part of the 
Sun. You must have noticed many times, when the weather changes the Moon has a halo. The Sun also 
has one although not visible to us; the study of the effects of planets upon human beings and upon 
markets will reveal this halo of the Sun. At the time a planet is within its halo I found that such a planet 
is useless and has little or no effect; but on either side beyond the halo, it again has its effect upon 
human beings as well as on stocks or commodities that it is present. The halo of the Sun is measured in 
degrees, so many degrees each side of the Sun (about 100). See Illustration No. 10, Page 74. 
Let us now call for illustration's sake that Venus as morning star represents Happiness, let us 
assume further that when within the halo or orb of the Sun it represents Health and as evening star it 
represents Money. In this assumption happiness does not very well join up with money since they are at 
opposite ends of the Sun, but health joins both since it is found to be in the middle, within the halo. 
Were it not for the constant oscillation of the planets towards the Sun and away from the Sun, 
the individuals living on this earth would have absolutely no hope of ever being  
84
Extreme elongation of Venus from the Sun is about 480
subject to a change. But, thanks to Nature, for a while, Venus is the morning star and for another while 
it is seemingly nobody and again for a little while it is the evening star. 
This condition alone would make things still not very oscillative unless the various beings were 
not born at all sorts of moments. Some are born when Venus is the evening star, others when Venus is 
in the Sun and again others when Venus is the morning star. Those people or stocks born when Venus 
is morning star (excluding for the time being that the other 6 planets are also affecting us in a similar 
way) will act alike and will be attracted to each other. They are chips of the same block. Births in 
contrary sectors will act contrary upon each other. With this idea we can explain somewhat that a trader 
buys a stock and as soon as he has done so it moves down on him; he just has bought an "enemy”. I am 
speaking of “births only" at this moment. Therefore an enemy by birth will be a permanent enemy. To 
illustrate this better let us say: a person born with Venus as Evening star who buys a stock or 
commodity born at the time Venus was morning star is buying an enemy.  All he can expect of such a 
trade would be the wish that his Venus had plenty of longitude to feed the contrary position with 
money. We have necessarily "half-enemies" which would represent the adjoining position, i.e. the halo 
or middle position, compared to either outside (as morning or evening Venus.) An evening star trader 
buying a stock born in the halo has to take occasionally small losses in such trade although they are not 
as disastrous as those taken in morning star stocks. Only when a trader is fortunate enough to pick a 
stock or commodity of his own birth will he be able to make money. This is my personal opinion. To do 
so, he either figures it out or else he finds it out through experience. In "Time Factors" I stated several 
years ago: when you take a severe loss in a stock never try to get even with that stock. You surely will 
take another trimming. Now then we have an extra minus and one small minus against one plus; this 
gives the overweight to the minus side. It does so for the average trader. It accounts for the constant 
change of "Traders Material" if I may, for emphasis sake use this expression. The average trader who 
frequents brokers offices lasts about a year under normal conditions before he has to quit. What about 
your self? Ah, this is where you differ and rightly so.  
85
The first virtue you possess, above all other traders is your attempt to learn how to overcome 
obstacles or deficiencies. This is why you subscribe to “Preview”. If you have any traders’ friends at 
heart, you should tell and explain to them about my work. They just don't know of it. You have 
realized, probably long ago, that business rules cannot be used as stock market rules. General learning 
such as Law, Medicine Art, etc. does not help in the least. It may hurt some readers, when I say; my 
experience with traders these many years has shown me that the poorest traders are doctors and 
lawyers. They are the greatest plungers I have ever known. It must have something to do with their 
profession, where, after a consultation the watchword is: we have to win the Case or, we have to 
operate successfully and, if things do not come out the way it had been planned......They lack the ability 
to stop in the middle of a case or of an operation (I mean a trade in the market) when they notice that 
the commitment is wrong. They just wouldn't jump out when losses pile up, but they have decided right 
at the time of the commitment to see it through to a profit. Let me say to them: the patient or client in 
their case is the stock, which is traded. If "he" is sick don't try to cure him by supporting him. 
The mental condition of lawyers and doctors is always bullish, they want to win every case, and 
they want to perform every operation successfully. This thought, in stock market terms, is expressed by 
BUYING; they actually would not accept the idea of "losing a case," or a patient dying on them: Such 
thought expressed in market terms would be SELLING. Thus they never think of markets that go down. 
In the event they happen to strike a movement right very seldom do they take profits or normal profits? 
Not taking profits is bad policy in the market; taking losses is often times a virtue as long as they are 
small. 
The second "virtue" you possess is your belief that planetary forces govern movement of stocks 
and commodities.  We know that astronomers figure out the exact positions of these planets from day to 
day and their individual motions. They are not concerned with the effect of these planets upon human 
beings or upon stocks and commodities. In fact, I have never seen an astronomy book, which would not 
contain a chapter saying in essence that people who believe stars and planets can affect us just "have a 
screw lose". If we would not believe this, and even prove it, should we want to, we could revert back to 
earning reports and other statistics so as to buy when earnings are at the peak and sell stocks when the 
corporations pass the dividends, because their earnings have dropped so low that the red appears. As far 
as proving that planetary movements affect human beings into buying and selling stocks or 
commodities, we just take an ordinary Table of planets motions and scan some of the Eclipses formed 
by Sun and Moon and look at the effect:

Enumerating these eclipses I have for lack of space passed up the years 1934 and 1935. I also 
ignored the Eclipses with the Moon. There are usually two Sun Eclipses a year. If two eclipses of the 
Sun occurring in one year bring two major changes in stocks or commodities can we find a rule in this 
or shall we just say: It is a coincidence? Of course, astronomers, in their exact work would want the 
effects to be: the moment an eclipse occurs, that very moment every trader should change his mind. 
We, however, are satisfied with but the halo of the eclipse since we have in our arm sleeves a whole lot 
of other astronomical phenomena that assist us in recognizing the approach of a change of trend. 
Note from the example of eclipses, at times the mind of stock traders is affected, at other times 
the mind of wheat traders and again at other times the minds of both types of traders undergoes a 
change. This does not matter as long as people change their minds. To define when one happens and 
not the other would be going into the finer points of the work of research. All we want to do just now is 
to show that eclipses bring about a change of mind among the traders toward wanting or not wanting 
stocks or commodities. 
A few years ago I read an article wherein some professor had been checking up on people or 
firms that make forecasts on market movements. He did not stipulate whether such forecasts had been 
made with the aid of planetary movements or whether they were made up from statistics and "outlook". 
It could not have very well been the former since you can count planetary forecasters on your 
fingertips, while the other type seems to bloom rampantly. He found that in the course of several years 
they were 40% right in their expectations. As stated quite frequently, my forecasts for minor 
movements over many years have not been always right, but they were very right for major movements.   
When the forecast was wrong, it was so but temporarily. For example, in the June move of 1939, my 
forecast was all wet, and I have never tried to paint it any other way, but let us look at the actual facts. 
We had bought wheat in March and early April 1939, stressing the idea that wheat according to the gold 
standard was actually back at the 40c level, which was the bear market low price in 1932. According to 
my article about pyramiding (page 21) we had to make the major commitment at or near the low, 
decreasing the amount of additional purchases as we moved higher. The fact, as admitted by clients, 
was this: many clients did not buy or else they bought very little around the mid-March and early April 
1939 low. They said: We will watch it. Then the up move developed suddenly so fast that before they 
knew of it the price was above 76c, an advance of some 15c. When they saw wheat at such levels things 
looked good to them and, unfortunately the corner of June 1st, 1939 actually became a top instead of a 
gap upward. Thus the forecast strengthened their courage. Anyhow, many bought only close to the top. 
When things turned downward I said in my weekly analysis: I would hold on to wheat now since most 
of it had been bought around the low (assuming this) and the amount bought at high levels just had to 
be carried down once more, since, in my years of experience I knew that the price of wheat normally is 
not 60c but above $1.00 and, when the trend does reverse, it will make a fast move. This it did. He who 
bought in March or early April never even got into red except a few cents in the Winnipeg market, but 
no trouble was experienced in Chicago at all. He who pyramided wheat last spring according to rules 
explained on page 21 could not have come into any difficulties in spite of my erroneous interpretation 
of the aspect of June 1, 1939. This summer's work has made me find the cause of the error I add now. 
87
At any time a condition similar to last May occurs again, we shall not miss the direction. I found it 
listed as an extraordinary case in 1001 Nights. 
Let me bring a small list of tops and bottoms that had been located in my work of forecasting 
(old clients can verify this): the top of 1929; the exact day of the bear market low, June 2nd, 1932; the 
bottom of March 1933; the exact day of the top of July 7th, 1933 (it was the rail top); the low of 
October 1933; the top of April 21st, 1934; the exact day of the low of Sept. 17, 1934; the March 8th 
high of 1937 for stocks and the Thanksgiving low of 1937; the 156 level as top in November, 1938 and 
the January, 28th low of 1939. All these dates were not forecast a week or so before they occurred by 
accidentally defining such day top or bottom within a movement, but the June, 1932 bottom was 
forecast a1ready in January, 1932 as the major low of the bear market; the July 7th top, 1933 was 
forecast actually during the banking crisis, 1933. The April top in 1934 was forecast when the October 
21st low 1933 had been made. The subsequent years forecast dates you can find in magazine articles as 
having been forecast a long time before they were due to appear. The top for the present movement up- 
wards I have for February 5th, 1940. 
This work of forecasting, has been done only by using planetary movements, and nothing else. 
When I look back over the years I can see with what primitive methods I started in. At the present stage 
of my knowledge I hardly can believe that the forecasts could have turned out so well and to the point. 
It goes to show that any average person, with a desire to learn forecasting trends can acquire this 
knowledge. The idea is but to get the right point of beginning. The trouble with most traders is that they 
think some black magic has to be used for it. No doubt, there is a lot of work connected when trying to 
forecast movements of individual stocks, since each one has its own habit. To forecast the general stock 
trend and to learn how to do it is fairly easy. I do not use a regiment of statisticians, nor do I have a lot 
of stock chants by the day, week or month the way Hotel rates run, but a simple line is all that is used. 
There is another thought coming to me right here concerning the professor who checked on the 
Forecasters. To criticize something is much easier than to do it. Even though the forecasts he checked 
proved to be but 40% right, I doubt very much whether or not he could have done as well. 
We have been getting far off our subject: happiness, health and money. There is a large part of 
mankind, which aims exclusively towards obtaining happiness, such as societies clubs and associations. 
Everything that belongs to them we would therefore include into our first group, which we termed for 
explanation's sake Venus as evening star or group No. l. 
We must include: the language that is spoken, the music which entertains, the theatre and 
movies, the circus, automobiles, foot ball and baseball, fights of any kind including war. This is a rather 
broad field to come under one planetary heading. It goes without saying that a careful work of 
dissection is required. Turned over into market language, we therefore can associate the following 
groups of stocks under the heading of Evening star; moving picture stocks, automobile stocks, steel 
stocks and even rails should go in here, since they supply means of transportation to the millions 
looking for happiness by making trips. It also includes, rubber, silk, copper and other commodities. 
The center group (group No.2) concerns health and all the circumstances and conditions leading 
to it or aiding it in a positive or negative way. Therefore, we can place into this group all 
pharmaceutical stocks, also all food stocks, which latter had been enumerated already in the first group. 
Hospitals, doctors, dentists, undertakers, cemeteries, crutches, artificial limbs, walking canes, Ex-lax, 
magazines explaining why one should eat three raw cabbages a day, clubs that further outdoor life and 
nudist colonies belong to this type. And last but not the least the food commodities sugar, fruits, cocoa, 
and wheat especially. 
The morning star group (group No.3) as the last one would include the remainder. All lines of 
business that concern money such as banking, lending money, pawn brokers, credit companies, real 
estate, governmental affairs (issuers of money), belong in here. Stocks of this group include Bank 
stocks, bonds, Credit company stocks, government bonds and real estate investments. 
88
We can see at a glance that the majority of stocks and commodities belong to the Evening star 
group. Any trader who has his Venus at the other side (as morning star) seems up against it when 
reading in these items. Only if he has Venus, as evening star should he be able to make money by 
trading in them. In order to make money trading he would have to select stocks and commodities of his 
own group or of the neighboring group. A trader having his Venus with the Sun would fare well trading 
in wheat or other grains, also with food stocks; he would have mediocre success trading in any of the 
two remaining groups, the evening star or morning star group. Such a man would never get cleaned out 
completely which may happen occasionally to the others. 
The morning star group has plenty of facilities to invest in stocks that have to do with money 
such as bank stocks, bonds and credit company stocks. They also may operate in grains and be fairly 
successful or in pharmaceutical stocks. It would be disastrous, however, for them to operate in stocks or 
commodities of the opposing group No. 3, which covers most industrial stocks and industrial 
commodities. 
In newspapers we have for the past few years an index of commodity prices, where some 
"clever" statistician conceived the idea to just merely add from day to day all the prices of the various 
listed commodities. The result is intended for traders to be plotted to make deductions of what is due for 
commodity prices tomorrow and the next day. Can you now see the error of such computations? That 
the results expected cannot be right and useful? Similar stunts are done with the stock averages, but 
fortunately they have not many food stocks included in the industrial list so not much harm can come of 
it. 
Longitude, declination and latitude are separate entities; they give best results when we are able 
to use them together (the Trinity). Let us assume now that longitude represents the "time" in the market, 
declination the price and latitude the "volume” of transactions. The most important factor for trading is 
the "timing” or, as we shall call it the longitude. When the time is right, price and volume are right 
automatically. Therefore, I have discovered long ago that if I know the day a top or bottom is due, the 
price as well as the volume will confirm. We may even go as far as saying for our crude work of 
determining tops and bottoms, we only need one of these entities and not the three. Some people who 
know nothing of laws of motion have the ability to "feel" a top or a bottom just by watching the volume 
of transactions others "feel" a top or bottom by watching the price levels. The latter, however, must 
leave some inkling as to certain price levels at which stocks and commodities like to stop. This can only 
be discovered when one has charts of the daily performance of various stocks or commodities for a 
period backwards. We can see that 52 1/2 or 67 1/2 or 72 are not merely numbers, but that they are 
numbers at which major changes occur, especially so when volume and time agree also. We just have to 
learn the knack of how to make graphs. Aside from this, we must know about the law that all motions 
are made in ellipses. This chapter, we shall touch in one of the next issues. It was one of my first 
inventions or finds. Yet, today I use the very size of ellipse, which I made to fit a certain movement of a 
stock (CTM) many years ago. 
The "Timing" or longitude is the most difficult part of all. No doubt forecasters and statisticians 
also try to use timing, I but in such crude and awkward ways that it is no wonder the average trader 
cannot detect their major error in such timing. For example they use dividend dates of stocks, dates of 
speeches of some important man, publication of railroad (car loadings, etc, as a criterion to expect a 
change of trend. Another very fine wording they have around Christmas: tax-selling time. This latter 
should explain away the fact that due to the Sun being the furthest away from us at the time of the 
Winter solstice, this Sun and not the tax-collector makes us feel somewhat "cool" towards the stock 
market many a year, but not all the years. 
Any one of these items used by statisticians are expected to bring a change of trend has received 
my own checking. It revealed that stocks on such dates can move up, can move down and can merely 
move sidewise. When the market moves up they say this was not anticipated; when the market moves 
89
down they say: it had been discounted; when we move sidewise they say it had no effect. Any baby can 
do that. But to say at this time (October 29, 1939) that next February 5th, 1940 stocks should be found 
at an important peak possibly the peak for 1940, would be a forecast. If this comes true, would this be a 
guess or a correct deduction of how planetary movements affect human beings towards desiring to own 
stocks? If I further anticipate and say that my work indicates thereafter a return to approximately the old 
120 level of Dow Jones and even could quote the date as Thanksgiving 1940, would this be a rough 
guess? But enough of this. 
Longitude, as stated before, does not fix the exact place of a planet; it does very nearly so since 
declination defines only the distance of the planet from the Equator, north or south of it and latitude 
defines its distance from the Ecliptic north or south. (See Illustration No.11, page (79). For illustration's 
sake, let us assume we fly in an airplane. The plane should represent a stock or a commodity. Its 
longitude would be 1210 55'40" West of Greenwich at the time it flies over Carmel, Calif.; it would be 
but 730 58' West of Greenwich when it flies over New York. Its flying height or altitude may be 100 
feet or 1000 feet above the ground at various times. This particular height we shall call our declination 
and latitude (the one refers us to the celestial Equator, the other to the Ecliptic). The plane can be seen 
at Carmel irrespective of its height or altitude and at some other time it can be seen at New York, 
subject to its momentary altitude.*  Declinations and latitude are therefore secondary factors while 
longitude is the primary factor. 
 
OK  = Longitude (measured in degrees of the Zodiac) beginning at O a Aries (Spring Equinox).   
HS  = Declination (measured in degrees north and south of Plane of Ecliptic). 
KS  = Latitude (measured in degrees north and south of Plane of Equator). 
OH = Right Ascension (measured in hours and minutes). 
P
= Celestial North Pole (PP = Wor1d Axis). 
P'   = Pole of Ecliptic. 
ABC = Plane of Ecliptic. 
DEF = Plane of celestial Equator. 
90
The effect of a plane while in altitude around Carmel can be very noticeable in case it would be subject 
to a forced landing. In such a case New York would not be the least alarmed about it, being too far 
away to be affected. Parenthetically be it said however, that declination and latitude are very important 
for fine work. We are at present only demonstrating the crude laws.* 
Again our car was sidetracked! Let us revert now to our title: Happiness, Health and Money. 
Happiness is the prime motive of life; health and money would therefore appear to be but an adjunct to 
it. Just size up the situation carefully for a moment and judge whether it is not so. We have to have 
some health, else we could not live; we have to have some money to supply us with health (food) and to 
sustain happiness, the prime motive. When one is in dire straights, it is surprising with what little 
money he can get along nicely! If one is sick or even bed-ridden how happy is he, when a friend drops 
in, or when he gets but a word of solace. How miserable, on the other hand, is the human being whose 
happiness has been destroyed! What would he not give to have at least some happiness in life? Wars 
destroy the happiness of thousands of people. Wars belong to our assumed group No. l, the evening star 
group. Here is the question now: which group will be most affected by a war according to our 
deductions? Bankers governments, real estate of group No.3, in a lesser degree hospitals doctors and 
undertakers of group No. 2, with ex change rates dropping headlong of moneys of warring nations 
governments, whether winners or losers, suffering during the war and afterwards yet, real estate being 
laid waste. Hospitals get jammed with wounded; doctors as well as undertakers work at top speed even 
food commodities run amuck. It clearly indicates that they all suffer. Let it be understood here that high 
prices of foodstuffs, such as wheat are detrimental to the masses although profitable to the long traders, 
while the statement may appear paradoxical it is not. (Continued in Jan. Issue). 
 
*This example is not a very scientific comparison, since latitude is again something else, but I believe it 
would help to recognize the difference between longitude on one hand and declination and latitude on 
the other.  
TOPS, BOTTOMS, GAPS. 
 
Here we have another Trinity; tops, bottoms and gaps. From your observatory between the soft 
cushions of a broker's easy chair watch them how they develop and grow! 
Bottoms can be recognized in several ways. We distinguish different types of bottoms. Each 
stock and each commodity has a habit of making one or two types of bottoms. Never another type of 
bottom will be made except the one intended by nature for each stock and each commodity. 
 
Usually, after an important top has been made and everybody has bought a full load, traders 
begin to look at one another; they wait to see who is willing and who has the money to push stocks 
higher. Of course they have bought stocks with the idea to shove them off at still higher levels to 
someone else, unless they bought for investment. Volume keeps up strongly; there are still a lot of 
people left who are willing to pay the same price for the stocks as they did, but not a higher price. 
Gradually the volume decreases, especially when the price structure slips slightly. This period is of 
greatest importance for traders. Watch! Beware of narrow movements at high levels with two or three 
successive days of small volume, coupled with a slight shading of prices. (See illustration No.12. page 
80). This period is meant when it says in the book "1001 Nights" in the story of “Aladdin and his 
Lamp”.  He threw little pebbles down into the cave. It is the Law of the Fall. A small start is followed 
by an avalanche; a series of successive drops. What is the cause that brings such a sharp drop about? At 
the time the pebbles are dropped, long buyers of stocks hold, look around for someone to push their 
stocks up; short sellers find markets too strong just then to dare to sell them short. The "pebble 
dropping period" is a sort of re-adjustment period when little trading is done---- some sort of “quiet 
91
before the storm". The next morning, however, usually a small gap appears. A gap is a space left open 
between the trading of the preceding day compared to the trading of the present day. The opening is as 
a rule very quiet, but it begins to increase shortly thereafter when all the traders are assembled in 
session. By 10:50 am the West Coast gets the opening prices over the radio. 
 
Typical top and bottom formation, showing the 10 days arc and the various gaps. 
 Such a formation was seen during March 1939, in stocks. 
This Western awakening accounts partly for the rallies and slumps at 11 o'clock noticed so frequently. 
Before the day is too far advanced timid traders and those who can read the hand-writing on the wall: 
''Mene-tekel-upharsim'', get out quick and the latter reverse to the short side; the others keep looking 
and hoping for the next run-up which doesn't seem to develop; instead, at closing time stocks are off 
quite a bit. They hope for tomorrow's rally. The next day usually a second gap downward is made, 
92
which prevents long traders from getting out at the previous day's prices, even if they had made up their 
minds during the night to do so. Instead of acting, they wait and watch and look, and what they expect 
does not happen. Prices keep going down hill. This procedure keeps on until about half of the decline 
that is in the making, has run its course. A period of rest for three or four days follows around this 
halfway down level. Some shorts cover positions for a turn here others buy stocks since they had a big 
re action. The volume remains small on the rally. Activity is very low. Holders of long stock from the 
top consider to average now, in order to get their average price down a little. Some jump in to buy an 
extra 100 shares for which a short seller is just waiting the chance to get rid of. 
 Then after all these little matters had been taken care of, the storm breaks out in earnest. A gap 
is usually again made downward, volume increases prices give considerably. This performance 
continues for 4 or 5 days, lower and lower with no end in sight. But this is when buying time arrives. 
The top buyers sell in disgust, novices in short selling see stocks drop headlong and also want to get a 
slice of the drop for quick profits. Volume becomes enormous; the tape gets behind for 5 and more 
minutes. Then is the moment to buy big bargains at your price at the market. Looking over daily high 
and low charts of stocks you will find that while this tremendous turnover is in full swing, everything 
looks just black, we are reaching, looking across the performance of the last four of five months, a place 
which was formerly an important peak or an important low point. At this point or rather at this price 
level something is active that prevents prices from going further down. An invisible wall seems to run 
through the chart here, which we shall term: a resistance level. 
Many stocks are in a habit to make just one day such a low to open higher the next day. Then 
they keep going upwards again without further ado. Wheat, on the other hand, usually makes a 
performance which we shall call pounding. It makes a low; one day on big volume, does the same the 
next day; and again the day after. The extent of the movement during the days at this bottom area may 
amount to 3c and 4c, not breaking the top nor violating the bottom except, occasionally by 1/8 or 1/4 
point. Traders in wheat are prone to place stop loss orders very closely. They get the feeling that 
yesterday was an important low and they have a false rule saying that this low must not be broken any 
more. However, it happens that for one or two ticks the price of wheat falls below the first low to pick 
away all the "safety'' stops, then turns around and goes up 10c. Therefore, at important turns stops are to 
be kept far enough away; they are even many times unnecessary under such conditions. 
When the turn upward is due, or in other words when the bottom has been made, we usually can 
figure on a ten days arc. For three of four days we have a steady rise, a day or two sideways at high 
levels but with small volume. Then follows a recession for the remainder of the ten days very nearly 
back to the previous original low level, somewhat above or even a little below. This so-called 
secondary bottom is really the beginning of the new movement whereas the first bottom, ten days 
before was the end of the down movement. This ten days arc we may call "the holiday'' or the period of 
re-adjustment from a declining market over a rising market. It can be compared with the shift of gears 
in an automobile from a reverse movement into a foreword movement. It takes a little time and, 
besides, often times the gears will grind somewhat, refusing to enter the contrary movement 
immediately. 
A common occurrence is the so-called end-gap. After a long decline, accelerating gradually, we 
pick up such enormous power downward, that people even try to sell stocks in their sleep during the 
night. News at such times is also discouraging. This news encourages long holders to dump their stocks 
at any price the next morning. Therefore, considering, the power which keeps on working even during 
the night; we cannot expect anything else but a big size gap so as to clean them all out and make this 
way bottom on heavy volume. This point we shall call "the explosion of the bomb shell". To distinguish 
between a normal gap and an end gap (the latter occurs near the bottom as well as near the peak) one 
has to just watch the volume. The moment you yourself think after a substantial decline has occurred; 
now we should really start the decline and--- you see that a gap is made of a point or so downward 
93
change your mind quickly because the gap down is the end gap. The bottom arrives either on the very 
same day or a day later. (See illustration No. 12). 
After the ten-day arc is completed, we have to expect the change of trend i.e. the new movement to get 
seriously underway upwards. After a few days of a creeping up move, the pebbles are now thrown the 
other way. We should witness a small, apparently insignificant gap upwards, telling us: here we go. 
Without keeping charts you just cannot see such a gap. As the volume gradually increases we keep 
moving upward in price without much reaction. About half ways up some stagnation usually arrives, 
which does not mean a come-back to the old low as so many figure, but it is a resting period for another 
shoot upward, similar to the picture we had on the downside before. Once this resistance, if we may call 
it such has been overcome, another gap is ordinarily made. Volume also increases quickly and trading 
becomes heavy as we parade upward to near the actual top. 
In bear markers, when we approach the very end, the volume is unusually small I would say off 
hand that any 300,000 shares full day trading volume after substantial declines would constitute a 
buying day of leaders. Recall that during June and early July, 1932, stock sales amounted to 250-300M 
shares a day; last June, at the low level nearly the same volume was obtained. At this very stage 
(October 29, 1939) the volume compared to the present price level is very small since, when we were at 
the 156 level the last time just about one year ago, we had 3,000,000 shares a day. Alone from this; we 
must deduct; that while the 156 level of a year ago; became a top area from which we dropped to 120, it 
should now become a bottom level in spite of the fact that we rose 35 points (!!) coming up from 120. 
The end of bull movements does not arrive with a daily volume of one million shares in present 
markets. We can talk of top areas when three million shares or more are dealt in. 
Mind you one more thing: a gap, whichever its direction, means that the power, the push, the 
incentive the trend or whatever we may call the planetary urge that moves our minds towards buying 
and selling, is IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GAP. So that a gap upwards means the tendency is 
toward higher levels; a gap downward means that the tendency is towards lower levels. Even when end 
gaps are made at or near extreme tops and bottoms the trend is still in the direction of the gap, but it 
represents the final exhaustion and we shall call such end gaps "exhaustion gaps" as a distinguishing 
mark for "in-between gaps. 
Of course, much more can be said about gaps, tops and bottoms which we shall do some other 
time. But for safety's sake have one more rule on gaps. When one is made on a certain day but closed 
either during the day or within a day or two, do not consider it as one; a gap is only good and worthy to 
be called a gap when it stays open and prices move away from it quickly. Prices should not linger 
around gaps after they have been made. If they do, get out for the time being with a small profit, or 
even else with a small loss, but get out and wait. Some of the inactive stocks are full of gaps. Those 
stocks I have not in mind when I talk about gaps. We consider only active much traded issues so-called 
leaders. 
We have found that stocks make secondary bottoms usually after a period of ten days from the 
actual bottom. They also make usually two tops at an interval of about ten days the latter or final top 
can be a little higher than the first or a little lower, which does not matter. In 1933, for example, rails 
made their top on July 7th. The general market then receded slightly, came back and made the final top 
in the industrials on July 18th, 1933. I distinctly recall the strain I was under during the last three days, 
from July 15th to 18th, 1933. After I had everybody short on the 7th some of the industrials peeped 
through the highs by a point or so. At that time I had for local New York consumption a daily analysis. 
In the issue of July 17th, 1933, I only wrote the following sentence: "Hold your horses, we shall not 
reap hazelnuts but watermelons, if you just stay put". They did; we had shorted Dupont around 83, 
covered it at 60 1/2 and went long again.

FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR DECEMBER 1939. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT STOCKS TO DO: 
Stocks in general should act quiet as we leave the month of November.  December, as a rule, is 
a rather quiet month with tax selling in predominance.  Some years even tax sellers get fairly good 
prices.  This should be true this month. The first four days of December should find us in a small 
reaction that should 
 
have had its origin at Thanksgiving, but the whole movement should be more a sidewise movement, 
getting ready for bigger things later on. A low for the 4th means buying back what has been temporarily 
sold around Thanksgiving, especially so when the market is drifting aimlessly and as yet has not made 
up its mind where to go. However, the movement indicated is upward. A spurt after the 4th should be 
arrested again by the 7th, producing a sidewise movement from this date over to the 14th, another 
typical December lull, but my estimation is that instead of selling out for the sidewise movement it 
95
would be better to just hold on, unless we are actually sitting at the Board and are trying to chisel a 
point or so in active leading stocks. After this is over, the stage should be set for another advance, 
steady and strong to new highs so that by December 19th, the high for the year 1939 should be reached. 
In the type of market we are having since the War had started, new high territories, whenever reached 
were followed by an attempt to distribute stocks. This sort of thing should also become evident right 
after the 19th of the month. The price movement should hold just a little below the peak level. The 
gradual up move, which should have had its inception the middle of November 1939, should be but a 
continuation of this movement, giving us a climax between December 19th and 27th, 1939. 
Holders of a sizable line of stocks should lighten off some stocks on the 19th, and the rest 
during the next few days following and remain neutral in anticipation of a reaction after we get into the 
New Year. The high levels, as said before, should prevail at high volume from December 19th over to 
around the 27th, allowing enough time to dispose of the line. Closer traders may even sell out 
completely and take a few leaders on the short side for a while into January 1940. 
The actual forecast with which I gauge stocks indicates a reaction to January 15th,1940, of 
normal size, but the wheat forecast, which is now made with the aid of Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves, 
shows a sheer drop for wheat from December 30th over to January 12th, a condition which is apt to 
carry over into stocks very strongly and we do not want to be caught napping. In conclusion, 
considering all these things and having a very high respect of Mr. Ali Baba, I say:  Take your profits 
just before or shortly after Christmas in all your stocks and have a clean slate over New Year. 
I would also take at the same time full short positions in active stocks, such as CN, RBC, X, GL 
GM, M, etc. which are to be covered around January 12th, 1940, and long positions resumed through 
out for the grand finale of February 5th, 1940. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT FROM WHEAT DURING DECEMBER.
The wheat market should have finally reached a temporary top the last day of November, after 
having had a steady rise for about three weeks. This top however, should be but a resting place to give 
traders a breathing spell. A reaction is indicated for the first 7 days of the month. Should we find the 
marker at a high level at the end of November, the way my forecast indicates, then I do suggest to take 
a temporary short position in grains for the first six days, having, however, constantly an eye on your 
commitments since when this reaction is over, we should develop a very wicked and strong upward 
movement that might get many a short into Christmas distress. The preceding cycle shows a continued 
run upwards without any reaction from December 7th clear up to the 30th of the month, a day we may 
not forget for a long time since it has the indication of a major top from which a major reaction should 
begin. I suggest to get rid of all long wheat; let someone else carry it for a while and he who wants 
more, give him some wheat you do not own (sell short). A sheer drop of the 1933 July variety in stocks 
and wheat which is to last a while, is shown as due. I would surely get busy on acting if the strength 
expected from December 7th to December 30th has developed and when drought news or other things, 
newspapers like to use for explanation of tops and bottoms, becomes acute. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON. 
The action of cotton for the first half of December points to somewhat lower levels a continuation of 
the drift carried over from November. As we approach mid-December, however, a spirited advance 
should begin, ending the year at or near the high levels. Would therefore suggest the buying of cotton 
around mid-December but would also accept profits as the year 1939 end.

WHAT READERS THINK. 
Xtown, N.J. October 29, 1939  
Dear Mr. Bayer. 
I have finished reading your last Preview and was left kind of bewildered because you travel so 
far back in thoughts and seem so sure that you were there once, wherever it was. 
I am living in such a different world where people are interested in only “to-day" and in what 
they "see" and "hear" and in accumulating material things it seems to me. 
I like to collect things myself like clothes and whatever one can use, just for the fun of doing it, 
finding what you want. To do this I have to trade in the market and follow the trends. I like that because 
is gives me new contacts, something to think about and it takes my mind away from my house work 
which I like too, but both take a lot of time and energy. 
To come back to why I started to write you, I have decided to order your Astrology Lessons 
now and say, before you send your Bible Lessons to "Lamme", to the Pont-des-Arches, I might want 
one later that I might better understand what it is all about. Am wondering where the "time" is coming 
from though. 
This is what I have been thinking: Since you were born in Gemini which sign is in my 11th 
house, you are naturally a good adviser and a good friend to me and I know that I have been successful 
since following you, even though at times I go absolutely against you with my commitments and come 
out right too. 
So I am sending check for $12.50 for a renewal of the weekly analysis plus $5 for the Astrology 
Lessons. 
Gratefully yours,  
Mrs. H. T.

THE SUN AND MARKET MOVEMENTS 
 
On page 75 I showed that eclipses have a lot to do with movements of markets. There is much more 
to consider yet. 
Very few people realize that the Sun has a motion of itself. Not only does the Sun run around the 
Zodiac consuming what we call one year by completing one of these rounds, but, she turns around her own 
axis every 25 days 5 hours and 38 minutes. The Sun has two poles upon which to turn around, these poles 
are inclined towards the Ecliptic at an angle of 70 degrees. The longitude of the rising node of the Sun's 
Equator is 740 36' or 14.36 Gemini. 
All these facts were discovered through observation of the so-called Sunspots. On and off we read 
in newspapers that a large quantity of Sunspots are visible upon the surface of the Sun which apparently 
create great disturbances all around; some even went as far as claiming that the number of Sunspots give an 
indication as to the trend of the market! However, such statements may be compared to a person who 
suddenly gets a lot of pimples in the face and thus is supposed to get sick or be sick. The cause of it is for 
the doctor to find out.  
Sunspots themselves are eruptions at fixed places on the surface of the Sun. Therefore; their 
apparent change on the Sun ties in with the Sun's rotation and not with their own movement. For this reason 
we can see Sunspots move in straight line's at a time when the Sun is found in or near one of the nodes 
while at other times this movement must appear in ellipses. The elliptic forms are most pronounced March 
5-7 and September 11th of each year. The lines are straight lines June 3-4 and December 5-6 of each year. 
In other words the sunspots' path is straight when the earth is in the plane of the Sun's rotation June 3 and 
December 5. 
When I stated above that the Sun's own rotation requires 25 days 5 hours, we must not forget that 
during one of these rotations the earth has also moved further and it takes a Sunspot an extra 46 hours to 
reach actually the previous point as seen from the earth. We can compare this movement with that of the 
hour and minute hand of a clock. Each hour the hour hand has to move an extra 5 minutes to catch the 
minute head.  
The total run amounts to about 27 1/4 days. 
The position angle of the Sun's axis changes as follows: 0 Jan. 4 and July 6. 
50 West: 
 Jan. 15 and June 25. 
100 West: 
 January 26 and June 14. 
150 West: 
 February 7 and June 2. 
200 West: 
 February 22 and May 18. 
230 27' West:  March 7 and May 5 (same as earth). 
250 West: 
 March 18 and April 25.   
260 20' West:  April 4-5 (extreme)  
50 East: 
 December 24 and July 17. 
100 East: 
 December 15 and July 29. 
150 East: 
 December 5 and August 11.   
200 East: 
 November 19 And August 27. 
230 27' East:  Nov. 7 and Sept. 11 (same as earth) 
250 East:  
 October 29 and September 21. 
260 20' East:  October 10-11(extreme). 
 
99
The Sun has therefore a sort of a tilting motion on each side of its North Pole, extending to 260 20' 
the extreme possibility East as well as West (See Illustration No13). 
When you look over these dates and check tops and bottoms of stocks and commodities, no doubt 
you will notice that they all form major as well as minor turning points; in short, days when to expect a 
change of trend. 
Let us go deeper into this subject, by making tables. The first one gives the series of the true Sun 
motion; the second gives the series of the synodic motion. We merely add up the duration of the rounds.

The synodic revolution less the true revolution gives the actual rotation differential, 
 or:  
 
  27,28 days 
 -25,35 days
= 1,93 days 
 
Taking one half of this value to establish a mean between true and synodic motion we get:  1,93 : 2 
= 0,96.
This value we add to the true revolution and obtain: 
 25,35 days 
 +   0,96 days
= 26,21 days. 
which, without explaining the reason for the adjustment I am going to make: 26, 25 days. 
The purpose of all this work is to arrive at values that would also define price levels of stocks. After 
long trials in this direction (made according to my records on January 20th, 1935), I divided this value 
(26,25) by 24 to establish an "hour" system. The unit obtained was: 1,09375 or, to make it a little more 
simple, we used: 1,094 as the unit. This unit becomes especially valuable when four (4) of them are used 
100
and we shall soon discover that my 8 3/4 law found many years ago as explained in "Time Factors" has this 
law as the basis.

This table is large enough to cover most stocks traded. What is now the purpose of such a table and 
how can it be used? First of all, knowing that it is developed from the Sun's rotation we have to use 
constantly the Sun in its various motions, especially its angles when it crosses on the dates given above. 
The degrees being even degrees throughout, except the 230, which is 23027' and the extreme position angle 
of 260 20', we find that we have a total motion of 540 40' from the extreme East side to the extreme West 
side. This value shows in our Table No.15, 50 Units or 50 days, (40 minutes = 0,698 hours). This again 
102
points out that the cross column 2, 26, 50, 74, 98 of Table No.15 of utmost importance, although when 
looking at it haphazardly, we do not recognize this fact. In other words, whether it be in days or in price, 
these levels are important for a change of trend. 
As a practical example about the use of this Table we check on U.S. Steel from June to the end of 
November 1939. The low was 41 1/2; which corresponds to our 38th day. The high was 82 or our 75th day; 
the reaction made 65 1/2 or our 60th day. The up move was 37days expressed in Table days (38 to 74) (not 
calendar days), the reaction was 15days. So that, by using the day column but substituting the column with 
the decimals, we obtain pretty good results, especially so when we don't forget that it says in Revelation: 
"in time and time and half a time the woman gets……..” i.e. in 2 1/2 times. 
As a special note I wish to draw your attention to the fact that my Table of Unit contains not only a 
division and adjustments to suit our own purpose, never mind what the astronomers think about us 
throwing around with these values but, what I call in that Table "Days" are actually degrees East and West 
of the Sun's pole, since the extreme position angle extends to 260 15', which equals 26 1/40 or 26,250. 
However, what I have studied from astronomical works such as Madler, Herschel, Newcomb and others, 
the astronomers are not any too sure of their 26020' value. However, we know ours is correct, since we 
prove such laws via market movements which measuring stick is so much more accurate than their 
telescope, being the absolute expression of how the traders' mind all over the world is reacting upon angles. 
Price levels are nothing but momentary planetary angles. We know 26 1/4, 52 1/2, 78 3/4, 105, 131 1/4 are 
absolute resistance points. A daily chart of "Case Threshing Machine'' over the past eight years would 
prove this statement as true as two and two are four. (Make a "Case" chart from Library records to get the 
real benefit by actually seeing what I am talking about else, read back what I explained on "Case 
Threshing" in my work "Time Factors". 
The purpose of this article is solely to give you a clue as to the direction into which holes we have 
to dig, so as to get results and become able to measure extent of movements as well as time changes. 
As you will note, we have not used longitude nor declination of the Sun, but only its tilting motion. 
I shall give as an additional example Chrysler's action this past summer (1939). Low was around 63; high 
was around 96 and the reaction brought it back to end of November to 83. 
Table No. 15; Move of Chrysler began at unit 58, ended at unit 88; advance was 30 units; let us 
divide 30 by 2 ½: we get 12 units. Deduct 12 units from the peak of 88 units: 76 Units or 83 1/8. The same 
we now try with U.S. Steel. Steel started as the 38 unit rose to 75 unit or 37 units; 37 divide 2 ½ equals 
close to 15 units which was the amount of the reaction (41 1/4 - 82 - 65 1/2). 
I have explained just now the law for strong stocks. With weak stocks we have to proceed by 
expecting a reaction to 2 1/2 above measured from the low. This is hard to express in a few words, but an 
illustration will quickly show what I mean. Let us take Goodyear Tyre and use approximate prices from 
recollection since I have no Goodyear chart on hand. Low was around 18 1/2. High was about 31. 
Therefore, we use units 17 to 29 or 12 units. 2 1/2 of 12 is close to 5. Instead of deducting these 5 units 
from the high unit (29 which is the same as the $31 price it reached) we add it to the low unit or to 17 
which equals the low price of about 18 1/2 .  17 plus 5 gives 22 as the unit. This 22 is in dollars 24 1/8, 
which it reached. Therefore, when we size up situations of individual stocks the reactions will show the 
strength or weakness compared to the market as a whole. You now may proceed to work up an idea how to 
figure the new tops due to be made by using the very same table the other way round!

ABOUT BOCACCIO’S DECAMERONE 
 
Since taking Bocaccio’s Decamerone to pieces, I am living in Italy.  My thoughts bring me back to 
several months spent in lovely Sicily, Palermo, Segesta, Trapani, on Monte Pelegini. 
It’s a long time ago, but somehow the Italian acquired at that time still clings to my ears and comes 
in handy right now. 
Bocaccio’s Decamerone deals with the “Black Plague” which, according to the story had taken 
place in the year of our Lord 1348. Be it said, before we go any further, that if we can interpret the writings 
of Bocaccio, we see that there never was any Black Plague at all, neither in Florence nor in Italy but the 
"Fairy Tale" is just used as an illustration to explain planetary effects, how they act in a bear market such as 
we experienced from 1929 to 1932. The title of "Decamorone'' could have just as well have been "The 
troubles of men from 1929 to 1932.'' 
There are several characters in the story. As strange as it may sound to you, all these persons are 
just one and the same person, i.e. planet, twisted into such wonderful form, talking to himself, walking 
around, singing, eating and drinking to his own health. This work, like all others mentioned previously as 
well as his supposed predecessor, Dante's "Divine Comedy" are all astrology pure and so simple. If once 
the thread is found, the more we get into the subject, the more we are astonished about the so-called 
“learned Classes". 
Getting off the subject for a moment, I wonder what the mathematicians are all doing after they are 
through with their studies?, sitting down and resting on their laurels?, or do they devote some time to think 
about where do the numbers come from and what causes numbers. What do the astronomers do after they 
quit college and know all about stars and sun and the rotation of heavenly bodies? I am nor even speaking 
about economists and investment counselors who always have ready answers to explain any sort of 
phenomenon pertaining to their lines. The more we dig, the more we recognize what a lot of guessers are in 
the world.  There is a cartoon in the S. F. Bulletin (a newspaper) ever since I have to read that paper. It is 
just one page ahead of the market sheet so I can follow this cartoon as a sideline. It depicts a man, who 
looks very wise, with a graduation cap on his noodle; sometimes they employ a hunting Indian in his stead. 
Anyhow, this picture brings forecasts on races; which sport this section seems to take very well. It is the 
fourth time I see him start with a cash fund of $200.  He bets on his own selections. Out of 50 bets he 
usually wins 15 and loses 35; so it is no wonder that his 200 dollars last him about six weeks, if that long. 
In fact the last 200 he shot away in less than three weeks. Just the same, people seem to like it and follow it.  
My opinion is that this fellow is still fairly good at his guesses, not considering what he uses to discover 
and locate his winning ponies.

In Decamerone we find several characters. These characters are all one and the same, i.e. one and 
the same planet. In order to explain this I must give you the names of these people (too bad for native 
Italian scientists that they can't decipher their own classics....). 
 There were 7 (!!) girls: 
Pampinea 
Fiametta 
Filomenz 
Emilia 
Lauretta 
Neifile 
Elisa   
 
There were 3 (!!) boys: 
Pamfilo 
Filostrado 
Dioneo 
 
There were 3 male servants: 
Sieisco   
Ticardo 
Parmeno 
 
There were 4 maidservants:   
Misia       
Stratillia 
Licisia Chimera 
 
Here is   some arithmetic:  
7 girls   
 
 
   3 men servants  
 
+3 men  
+4 girl servants 
10 persons 
 
 
  7 servants 
 
10 persons superior   
-7    persons inferior  
3 rulers, the Trinity = 1 Unit. 
 
Explanation of the meaning of these words: 
 
In the "Legends of the Jews" we find quite often ''Ish'', which equals "God"; in the Apocrypha we find 
several daughters whose name was ''Isca'' or ''Isha'' We also have among the 12 sons of Jacob one "Isashar". 
The one form is male, the other female. So that:  
E'sa is nothing but El-Isca and  
Lucisia nothing but Lic-isha. 
The El know from Jewish laterature means God, Eli-Eli. 
Neo means new and nea is the female form for it. 
Dio is the Italian form for Deus, God. 
Filo is the Italian word for wire a thread or as we need it a line. 
 
105
Fia merely omits the "1" from the feminine form. ''|Misia'', that's easy to change the way we need it. 
''Mi'' means in Italian "me"; and "sia" means "be" in the exclamation form, so that this person means: "it's 
but me, can't you see?" i.e. Pampi-nea. We know these old fellows had to cover up things. Many words 
have to be caught by the sound; we have Bimbo, bambino, bambini, a child male and female (o,a); so that 
Pampinea means "the new child" and Pamtilo means the "boy-child line”. Now, Tindaro should mean: Tin 
(tinnum in Latin), daro is "give" in Italian or "I shall give Tin", when this name strives, i.e. nothing. Menu 
reminds me of the French word "menu" i.e. small, so that Filomena means but a "small line," and, while we 
are at French, I just as well say that the isca explained above occurs also in French under the form of: "il y 
a", there is, So what does ''Elisa'' really mean? (E1-Isca). About Chimera the French word "Chinese" 
reveals the meaning. Stratillia and (Fi1o-) strada means the "Street" (not straight) and a street is but a line 
(look down from the Empire State Building in New York and convince yourself). 
As you now may recognize from what I explained here, the real astrology does not bother much 
about planets, where they are in the heaven but it produces its findings by means of lines (angular lines). 
Which lines and what kind of lines they are I shall let you find that out. A hint to the clever is enough. 
Aside of the Decarmerone Bocaccio also wrote: Amorous Fiametta, a sort of an appendix to 
Decamerone. Therein he has some fine statements and explanations borne of which I shall enlarge here. 
 
Page 103:  
my copy (Rarity Press NY, 1931):  
"Such feigned jests and invented tales could not AS A TRUE MATTER be justly set down 
in divers fabulous books." 
He means:  People just would not believe it anyhow if I would use the nature language. 
 
Page 137: 
 ''But why do I allege old examples?''  
He means: Why do I make comparisons with past performances of markets? Answer: 
Because in the past performance movements is the key to the solution. 
 
Page 102:  
"Who would have believed that LOVE could have taught me such ASTROLOGY, a science 
more FIT FOR FINEST WITS and profound JUDGEMENT and NOT FOR A TROUBLED 
MIND occupied with his fury. 
He means: One planet, called LOVE was the one who showed him the road to the solution; 
plenty of thinking is necessary and astrology is not for a person to study when he or she is 
full of troubles, occupied to "get himself out of a hole". In other words when you have made 
big blunders, it won't help you to consult the planets' aspects or positions to find out when 
you will "get out even"... 
On page 111 he brings a double negation. I doubt that all my readers will catch this double negation 
at the first reading (which makes the thought brought forth positive). He says: "Nor is it possible to 
prescribe so precise a time to future things as many unwisely believe." With this sentence you can very 
well see how carefully we have to analyze word for word in any of the sentences brought in works of that 
kind when we endeavor to go to the bottom of things to find the actual meaning. We must not assume 
writings of this kind have been done in a hurry, just because a magazine had to get off the press in a week, 
or, as some might think errors were made due to ignorance on the part of the writer not being able to use 
the proper language. I do not want to go too far into the findings made recently, but words such as and thus, 
oh, but, of, to you, me, he etc., never mean what we associate with them, but something else, and always 
the very same something else. As your study develops, the right substitute word suddenly just falls into 
your mouth so to say, and it must be held fast, else it escapes again. 
Now to the double negation: it is in the words: nor and unwisely; "nor" in this case is a negation, it 
is not possible; "unwisely" is a negation at least to me. Unwise is the opposite of wise. Since an unwise 
man does not think, does not care, does not bother about things, he acts in a negative way.  
106
In order not to get a challenge from readers, I better correct myself by saying: the negation is in ''to 
believe unwisely", instead of in "unwisely" alone, but it covers the idea anyhow. 
Page 43: (To save space explanations are brought in parentheses): "Although this furious passion 
(trying to solve the puzzle of life) troubled my wits and dulled all my senses, one only spark of all that 
good and wisdom, which was lost and gone (he evidently had also started from scratch, since he didn't 
understand the older texts, and nobody explained them to him when he started) kindled a prudent counsel, 
and knowledge of this true rule in my smothered and consumed heart which was, that LOVE ONCE 
DISCOVERED DOTH NEVER or very seldom come to a happy and good END (the work in astrology, 
once hit right never ends). The million and one things influenced by LOVE have each their own cycle, 
which must be figured. And therefore, amongst other profound thoughts I intended not to prefer "will" 
(which is Zero) before "reason" (mathematics), in bringing such desires to their wished end. And though I 
was truly by divers intermediate chances greatly constrained (making a living probably), yet, so much favor 
was granted me that without overcharging the mark, and stoutly enduring the grief (hardship due to belief a 
solution was possible), I passed it well away. And yet, in truth, the forces, which I yet have are of sufficient 
power to uphold and conserve such counsel. Because I WRITE MOST TRUE THINGS, I have in such 
order set them down, that except he, who doth know them (!!) as well as I do being the “occasion” of them 
all, “no others”, were he OF EVER SO SHARP A WIT AND READY OF CONCEIT could understand 
that IT WAS I. (The "I" was not Bocaccio: guess who!! (Love!). And even him I pray that, for THAT 
LOVE WHICH SOMETIMES HE BEARS ME, HE would conceal that which manifesting it, would NOT 
TURN TO HIS HONOR OR PROFIT. I endeavored with all diligence and at my fittest opportunity (I 
picked the very best moment astrologically possible to insure this work to have a permanent and large 
circulation) by alluring means and I did practice fine and subtle demons trances to kindle the young 
gentleman with those coals WITH THE WHICH I WAS ENFLAMED, and to warn him to be as wary 
AND CUNNING in his proper affairs, as I WAS WISE AND CIRCUMSPECT IN MY ACTIONS." 
In these short lines Bocaccio says everything he knows who he is, what it is, where it is to be found, 
how to approach it; he does not say how it is done. This "HE" explains as he goes along. 
From 1001 Nights I have a leftover piece worth noting. It says in one story (translated already into 
market language). These is no top, there is no bottom except by LOVE. (Vol. 111,9). 
 
WHO MADE THE LATIN LANGUAGE? 
 
Due to certain astrological laws, which I have been able to dig out from all sorts of old texts (not 
astrological books in the common sense of the word), many things appear in a different light. 
Here is a law for you. We human beings are not able to create anything what may be called alive or 
living, something that would have life.  We are only able to create dead things.  When they say: “ We 
received the latest creations from France”, then this expression is not quite true. 
When Mr. L. Samenhof invented at Grodno, Russia the so-called “Esperanto Language” or Lingoa 
internacia, he created a dead language, one that is only artificial and has not life in it.  It was designed to 
facilitate commercial intercourse among nations without the necessity of learning half a dozen languages.  
In short, Samenhof intended Esperanto as a correspondence language.  However, his results were rather 
mediocre.  I would not be surprised if some readers never heard of that language.  The reason for its quick 
death was due to the fact that Samenhof knew nothing about astrology, at least not about the astrology that 
was used by the ancients. When the ancient wizards wanted to create a language, they started at the right 
moment and produced artificially a language, which was called:  "Duration Incorporated". Millions of 
people use this language today. It spread over all the earth, the same way as the Bible, another one of their 
products. Humanistic colleges teach it. As said before, an artificial language is never intended to be spoken, 
since speak in the Bible means "move". It is only used for writing, to express thoughts, since "writing" in 
107
the Bible means to draw pictures (which ones?). This artificially produced language is LATIN. The Latin 
language never was spoken, neither by Romans nor by anybody. The French the Italian, the German, the 
English languages, I am certain have been spoken many years prior to the time astrologers got up the idea 
to make an astrological language. Up to the time of this discovery I thought and believed what was taught 
us in school were actual facts. I never dreamt that they teach things about which they know little about 
themselves. They teach that English, French, Italian, and much of German is derived from the Latin 
language. However, it is exactly the opposite. The Latin language is a mixture taken from all sorts of 
languages, taken from here and there producing a language that way. The process may be compared with 
the builder of a house (also a dead product) who uses sand and cement wood and iron and produces a 
house. Being an artificial product, they could put their own meaning into the words they created which is 
actually the case and which ought to make you understand why the words found in the Scriptures must 
mean something else than they are supposed to stand for. If some thing is artificial then it is artificial good 
and proper. Does a builder put his desired style into the building? 
Why are diseases, plants, animals, medicines etc. all called by Latin names among professionals and 
not by common names? Why do they even have two names; a name and a secondary name? 
This has an astrological reason. The main name places the plant disease or animal into its main 
astrological sector wherein "it" belongs, similarly to what I have discussed in the last issue as Morning Star 
and Evening Star. The secondary name points out the exact place where "it" belongs within those sectors. 
(Hour hand and minute hand of clock). Human beings have also two names even though the smart beings 
of today put their small place first and the important place as last.. Some people such as princes and other 
similar types have a row of these secondary names to make sure they run on all four wheels. Even cities 
and villages have two names. China, Maine, means the village of China in the state of Maine. John Nord, 
means the person John of the family Nord. Now, watch the astrologers how they used it: Carpinus betulus; 
Salix pendula; Phlox subulata; Augusta Vindelicorum. The family name was used first, followed by the 
secondary name. 
When we study modern or ancient languages, we use grammars to begin with. Off hand, we should 
think one grammar to learn French would be enough for all English speaking people. It may be written by a 
Mr. X who knows that language thoroughly. However, just go to a book shop, or better yet to a second 
hand book shop. Look over grammars that treat on French! You find them by the hundreds, some good, 
others not so good. The same has happened to astrological works in past times. Some are good, others not 
so good. The best, as far as we can judge, is supposed to be the Bible, since it was selected by a great 
organization to teach the laws (even though under cloak). I prefer the Talmud. The translator of the Talmud 
into English says in his preface that he could not furnish his ten volumes of work with an index, because it 
would be too complicated. It deals with too many subjects (do you wonder?). However, he carries main 
chapters, such as: Sabbath, ''on Oaths", Blessings, Day of Atonement and many others. Now, dear reader let 
me tell you what I found these captions do mean. They are nothing but subdivisions, the same as used in 
grammars: Substantives, Verbs, Adverbs, and Pronouns. "Blessings", for examples I have as their meaning: 
"Pronouns", their individual meanings and "uses". Just look over the Scriptures and note the immense 
quantity of pronouns used: you, he, us, ours, and them, to them, for them, at them, above them, with them. 
Each pronoun has an individual covered meaning. The best start any man could get who tries to solve the 
puzzle, would be to begin with attempting to solve the meaning of the pronouns. This approach I know now 
and wish I had known it several years ago. 
When we consider how screwy some of the Latin forms are, how artificially they are built, how 
completely they are against normal logical thought, and we cannot fail to recognize that this language is a 
constructed language and not a natural language. The simplest way to demonstrate this is to remind you 
that you can put personal pronouns, such as I, you, he, she, etc. behind the verb without making the 
sentence a question. They hitched the horse the wrong way and--can ride it. The scientists of today call 
such process “Latinism" being one of the peculiarities of the Latin Language. This is illogical, since the 
108
human mind does not work this way. Man always thinks of himself FIRST. Afterwards he thinks of what 
he wants to do. "I go". Me, my person, myself, has made up my personal mind to---go. Can you reconcile 
with human nature that he says: go I? Astrologically, yes. In astrology we always have to do with angular 
distances between the planets, or in other words, we have to do with the angular distance expressed in 
angles, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees etc. It is always measured from ONE planet, whereby the other 
planet may be ahead or behind it; so that to get a little close to the secret, "I" is the middle the center while 
"you" is ahead of this center and "he" is behind this center. Therefore, knowing constantly the location of 
the planets by merely using the correct pronoun, it is much more important to know the angle that is formed 
between them. This angle is expressed with the verb, with the right verb, which always means the same size 
angle and no other size. Can you now see why in the artificial Latin language they could place the planet 
(the personal pronoun) in front as well as in back? 
While we are at this subject I will show another splendid way these ancient astrologers used to get 
around difficulties. We all know that people are subject to changes, at times subject to very important 
changes. This is due to the change of the planet that governs them, like a ray now controls the movement of 
an airplane. It is alright for scientists to have a little ray direct and move airplanes at will, but they think it 
awful if a planet would make us move like jumping jacks at its will. Where would the human will come in? 
Let us connect our thoughts with the article of last month (Evening and Morning Star) and say: The planet 
that controls you or me has been a Morning star suddenly becomes an evening star (jumping for 
illustration's sake to the condition that first it has to get in touch with the Sun). In that case the figures in the 
Bible merely change their names and be done with it. Abe was first Abram, and then became Abraham; 
Sarah was first Sarai. Jack was first Jacob; then he became Israel. This latter's change was so important that 
a special story had to be made up for it, the story of the wrestling match during the night. So that when 
another "angle" gets active with people, they change radically. As an example we quote the former 
president of the Stock Exchange who was changed into a convict; the little Paper Hanger, as the late 
Cardinal from Chicago liked to call Hitler, changed into the most feared Napoleon of modern times. 
Something changes wheat from 60c to $1.60 and at other times from $1.60 back to 80c and it is not the rain 
in the Middle West, or Boston liquidation, or commission house selling. It is the planetary force that put 
Whitney into the hoosegow and Mr. Coolidge into Presidency. Another simile that approaches closely the 
above is the matter of marriage. A girl that gets married changes, among other conditions also her name. 
She begins a new life. People say also that a girl, shortly after she gets married also changes her figure 
quite a bit (I just now don't mean that what you mean); she gets more set, her girlish ideas, thoughts, 
behavior, etc. change; even the body-form gets more "woman-like". 
I now want to touch on an idea that is highly valued by present day astrologers. It is called the pre-
natal epoch. To me, it does not mean a thing. First of all have you ever thought about that in maternity 
hospital you may find in one day twenty births occurring, some of them at one and the same minute or even 
second. They may be male or female. The astrologers have the idea that some hours, what they call 
planetary hours produce males in male hours and females in female hours. Humbug. It depends upon the 
parents and their grandparents only. The parent cycle has to create (and not of its free will either) in order 
to produce at the fixed time a top or a bottom which we shall call male or female. Only for this reason can 
we forecast markets, otherwise we could do nothing. When forecasts do not click, something is wrong with 
the calculations and not with the planets. 
A client living just a cat's jump from the Mexican border wrote me the other day that some stock 
market Services said recently that nobody could make a yearly forecast on stocks or wheat. I wrote him 
about the following as an answer: These fellows work on nothing but bluff. They know nothing about 
planetary forces, they know still less about markets. When they have to write their version on what is about 
due to happen, they stick a few heads together, each asking the other: what do you think, and what do you 
think. Shall we tell them it goes up or shall we say it goes down. Once decided upon the direction they 
build up their "opinions" and out they go to the wallow the flies. The rest of the time most likely they go 
109
after "more business". Bayer has a funny way of doing business. His main object is to master the art of 
forecasting. He does this forecasting with the craziest things a "normal" man can think of; he uses the 
Bible, of all things, Arabian stories, the Decamerone, the Hebrew Talmud and many others. He follows 
very closely the performance of the markets though. Clients come without advertising. When time for 
renewal of subscriptions to his services comes around he sends out a small note that it expires. If by the end 
of the following week the renewal has not occurred the client's head is carefully severed and he continues 
on his Talmud. 
With this small article I give you facts, which scientists for several hundred years have not seen or 
realized. For me it throws thousands of books dealing with the subject "Latin language" right out of the 
window. Such finds come to me without looking for them, since it does not bother me much whether Latin 
is an artificial language or not, as long as I can use it for my purpose and for your benefit. But, this could 
only be found and recognized because I have found THE RIGHT APPROACH last June. 
So what is Homer what is the Nibelungenlied?  What are all the books on the Index of the Roman 
Church, prior to the year 1600? They are all astrological grammars. Rome does not want anyone to get too 
close towards recognizing laws, but "forbidden fruit tastes best"! 
Why do Kings in Egyptian pictures always carry a stick? You solve the meaning of that stick and 
you have solved the puzzle of motion! "In the balance shall they be weighed"! By the way "balance" does 
not mean ''Libra'' by any means. 
 
Happiness, Health and Money 
(Continued from Vol 1,7) 
 
The only group that should benefit would be group No 1, so that two thirds of the whole would 
suffer and one third benefit, keeping that way the eternal cycles of revolving. This condition changes, of 
course, in that the pendulum is due to swing again gradually over to group No 2, then to group No 3. 
Our work and endeavor, trading markets, both in stocks and in commodities, is done with the idea 
to make money, to make it fast as safety allows, to take it away from others, who do not know values at a 
given time. We are not able to do any harm to the stock, which we buy or sell, since the stock is one and the 
same at all times. So is a commodity. One share of Auburn Motors was exactly the same when it sold at 
516 and when it sold at 2. The Company is still the same i.e. the Auburn Auto Company. The only thing 
that has changed is the momentary value. Our business is therefore to exploit the change of momentary 
values as they rise and decline. Some of you may say: why is Auburn not back with the rest at fairly high 
levels? Here is the answer: A stock is like a human being; it is also subject to the evening and morning star 
the same as we are. The tide must have moved her over from group No.1, first into group No.2, then into 
group No.3, or, to suit the previous explanation better its Venus was an evening star but reverted into the 
morning star (mourning star). Such conditions do not affect other motor stocks since Auburn Motors has its 
own birth moment, which is different from all others. Only in one thing it has a common interest: it should 
be of group No.1. But, we know from other phenomena of Nature that such changes can occur. I read today 
of a bricklayer who because a fiction writer; a New Yorker may suddenly become a Westerner and a good 
stock may suddenly become a dog. Then another phenomenon must be considered that comes into the 
picture; some people die young, others become old and never give up their pep. The extraordinary pep of 
AAC in its younger days was somewhat suspicious, (it was but born on May 16th, 1928). The same applied 
to Radio, which seems to be related to it. The underlying normal explanation for its action is this: The 
public remembers too well the hay days of Radio as well as those of AAC. When the price began to 
approach their pocket book, they bought these stocks "to death"; putting every loose dollar into it in case 
they would make up their mind to go above 400 again. But, where the public is, there is trouble. The good 
110
trader shuns issues that are talked of too much; they shun issues that are in low brackets unless the final 
bull phase is just beginning. At such time the lowliest on the list peep up and double their price often in a 
week. But beware when the peak is passed! They fade out as fast as an electric bulb can blow out. 
We get brand new ideas about trading when we understand the above explanations. It is not the 
stock that moves up and down, but it is simply the mind of the people that moves the stock! Therefore, we 
have to analyze the people's mind and not the stock the way statisticians are doing. They hitch the horse at 
the wrong end! The people's mind is as changeable as styles. Each year we have our troubles to keep in 
style; a stock, which is a favorite now, will not be one after a while. When it stops being a favorite, which 
is shown by its activity, i.e. by volume and price fluctuation, leave its long side alone. It may be idle for a 
while at high levels and then begin to prepare for a rail spin. Just then sell it short quickly and feed shorts 
right along. Remember that a high priced stock has attracted a lot of good money that refuses to be 
dislodged for a long time; usually this money steps out when dividends are passed or reduced. At such time 
the smaller crowd takes over the stock. But what the big people could not hold up, the smaller ones can't do 
either. In fact, it indicates the beginning of the real decline. When it is still lower, the odd lot traders get up 
courage and they only step out when the stock is again ready to move up. 
If you have traded for any length of time, make yourself a list of stocks or commodities that 
produced profits; make also one showing the stocks that brought you losses occasionally and a third last of 
those that hurt you. Do the same with commodities. If you have not as yet traded any commodities I do 
suggest that you try them all in due time, when conditions appear opportune, at times when my weekly 
analysis suggests the purchase of certain ones. In a year or so you should have a complete analysis of 
stocks and commodities that favor you and those, which you should not use to trade in. Never try to get 
even! Abandon that issue completely that showed a loss of a serious nature. I do not believe that among my 
clients we could find any who would react negatively on all stocks and on all commodities so that they 
would have to take losses in anything they touch. This cannot very well be, since the readers of my works 
are not people of the poor class, else they would not have excess funds for investments of some sort. It is 
but a mere matter of checking the situation. Suppose the right stock or commodity (in singular as well as in 
plural) is found, stick to it and exploit it as much as you can. There is no pity in Wall Street. Either you win 
or you lose. The odds are not against you on account of the two "virtues" mentioned in the beginning. They 
would be against you if you would follow the crowds. 
 
FORECASTS OF MARKETS FOR JANUARY 1940. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF STOCKS 
The sharp reaction in January, spoken of in the last issue, should not become as serious as pictured. 
While there is a reaction due in stocks and short positions are advisable, as we go into the month this 
reaction should climax by the 8th of the month. After a small rally of a few days, an attempt should be 
made by traders to break through the lows; they may succeed in a few issues. Mid-January, however, 
should become the final turn upwards; first slow, making things appear as if we go down further, but 
around the 20th of the month the market should suddenly straighten up and run amuck upwards, giving us a 
rise the balance of January. We should cross the December highs and go into new high ground. Looking 
just a trifle beyond January, watch February 3rd, 1940, not only watch it, but also get out of all stocks and 
take short positions generally just when everything looks rosy and bullish. Don't let us get fooled with good 
news at that time. Ali Baba says: I'm from Missouri....... Ali, Kalif, Aleph (first letter of Hebrew Alphabet). 
According to my work, stocks are due to make a top February 3rd, revising thereby slightly the statement 
of last month that the 5th should become top. 
111
 
WHAT WE EXPECT OF WHEAT 
 
Down market until January 7th; up market the balance of the month into February 5th. Therefore, 
shorts carried over from end of December 1939 should be held until the 7th, when covering is order and 
reverse to long positions before January 11th. These days naturally and automatically should bring volume 
on the down aside at the expected bottom January 7-11, 1940.  Hold the long wheat position into early 
February. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT COTTON TO DO. 
 
After a creeping but steady advance in cotton prices since April 15, 1939, which amounts to 32 
points at the date of writing (December 5 1939), we can expect a critical point when we advance fully 35 
points on the chart or 350 points in the cotton price. If a gap upward is made at this level (10.40 to 10.50 
March New York), in this case the reaction expected in March cotton from end of December, 1939, should 
bring us back to the gap level, 10.40 to 10.50 which could be reached by mid January, or anywhere 
between January 8th and 20th. At this level and time would buy back cotton and hold it into early February.

All these commission are understood for a full contract. Wheat can be traded in less than the 
regular quantity of 5000 bushels. It can be traded in 1000-bushel lots or 1-5 contract.  The commissions 
for one such “Lot” as it is termed ranges from $2.50 to $3.00, so that there is not much difference in the 
proportion to the full contract commission rate. 
 
HOW TO LAY RAILROAD TRACKS IN THE HEAVENS 
 
The Sun is the only planet that has a fixed rotation in our calendar.  No other planet can be fitted 
into the calendar.  Venus, as well as Mercury, while close to the Sun at all times, are found at given 
dates such as January 1st of a year either in Capricorn, where the Sun is on each January 1st, or they 
may be in Aquarius already, or else they are apt to trail and move in Sagittarius on that day. 
The regularity of repetition of cycles such as we have to expect of Sun cycles, as shown in the 
article on page 85, bring us occasionally into hot water.  We can expect turning points, but this is all we 
can expect.  Chart formations should supply a cue for the direction of the change, the setting of the 
ellipse many times tells us whether it is up or down.  There is some connecting link missing which 
points out the direction of the change beforehand.  The question arises now:  If the Sun has a certain 
defined movement around its own axis, have the other planets such movement also and what is their 
time cycle, the angular motion of them?  If we plot the angular motion of the Sun on a chart, by having 
a zero line in the center, and plotting above the zero line the easterly deviation in degrees and below it 
the westerly, we may do the same with the other planets, obtaining that way several lines that wind up 
and down across the year’s chart on actual past performance some interesting results should come forth. 
When we now consider railway tracks that run from New York to San Francisco as representing 
the Sun line on our chart, we note that on the way we find several lines to branch off from these tracks, 
sometimes northward, at other times southward. For example, at Buffalo, N.Y. there is a southward 
track towards Pittsburgh, but we have no northward track. (In order to get into Canada, we use nearly 
parallel tracks, which lead at small angles towards Toronto and Montreal, but no actual northward 
track.) 
 
114
At Cleveland we also have tracks lending southward since Lake Erie won't stand for a track. At 
Chicago we find tracks running in all directions---a main center. At other points we find northward 
tracks without having southward tracks. 
Our actions, our way of doing on this earth is premeditated or dictated by the movements of the 
planets. Therefore what we construe on the earth must be available somewhere in the heavens. All we 
have to do is look for it. The race of the planets in longitude through the Zodiac does not help us very 
much to discover such pictures. However, big fields of operations are available when we use 
Declination and Latitude of the various planets by using the Sun as the main line around whose 
declination or latitude all others wind around. When using declination we must not forget that the Sun 
declination moves on a fixed angle of 23 27' so that the winding occurs along this angle. When using 
latitude we may use a straight zero line across the chart in that the Sun's latitudinal vibration is so small 
that it cannot even be plotted unless greatly magnified. It is not even shown in the ordinary 
ephemeredes. And even this Sun's latitude if plotted on an enlarged scale yields some very good results 
to locate tops and bottoms. 
If we wind the declination or the latitudes of the other planets around the Sun the way I 
explained it just now, we will get the main railroad tracks New York----Oakland with the many 
bifurcations or cross tracks. These cross tracks bring forth changes of trend in markets The difficulty 
facing traders is the immense amount of work connected with the plotting of all the planets, as well as 
the daily high and low charts needed for severe years backwards of various commodities and stocks. 
Unless they are made first, no work of value can be done. Why I say several commodities must be 
plotted is due to the fact that we have to try to locate stations in the heaven such as Chicago, or Omaha. 
They represent days such as July 17th, 1937, when every stock and every commodity makes some sort 
of a peak or places such as September 1st, 1939 when all stocks and all commodities make wild gaps 
upward. 
Careful notations of the effect of each of the crossings have to be made right into the charts, 
whether the approach of the line was from north to south or from south to north or whether they were 
made from, "half-way" points; i.e., when planets had not reached their extreme declinations or latitudes 
but turned halfway. This latter condition you will see quickly   when you plot them on charts. Each time 
the effect is different, but the effect once established does repeat well. Each planet, of course has its 
own effect again at such crossings. For example, Saturn crossing southward over Sun in Declination has 
always one effect upon wheat, but quite a different effect compared to Mercury or Venus doing it. The 
slower moving planets have more weight than the flighty ones. While Mercury and Venus cause the so-
called "jiggles", Saturn and Jupiter cause trends. 
Anyone who delves into these ideas presented here will have plenty of work and has to get 
ready for some big surprises the way tops and bottoms develop, but as in everything, experience will 
give you many times also the "feeling" which way the cat is due to jump. 
I have not quoted all the points that need watching after the chart is completed, but suffice it to 
say that when they turn at extreme low declination or latitude, or at extreme high points or at half-way 
points, important changes also come forth. 
A congregation of several crossings within a day means a real important change, especially so when 
heavy planets are involved. They are far apart in time, but when they come they give major changes.

The  5=4  3=3  Method 
 
DEFINING TOPS AND BOTTOMS WITH A MECHANICAL DEVICE 
 
When we speak of mechanical devices, we must immediately bear in mind that mechanical things 
are rigid and not flexible unless flexibility is built into it. In markets anything that is mechanical is 
rather dangerous to apply, unless several other factors are considered with it. 
During the many years of research on markets I have struck on the craziest ideas one can 
imagine to try and make movements fit something. I am digging a few things out of my files and you 
can play around with them and see how you fare. This mechanical device explained here may be 
applied to individual stocks, to individual commodities or options. It requires daily (not once in a while) 
five minutes work for one stock or one (each) commodity. If kept up for a while, and plotted properly 
on K&E paper, you will gradually obtain a line formation, which does not look at all like a wheat chart 
or a stock chart. The work should be calculated on a daily basis and--don't forget also on a weekly 
basis. There is one thing sure about this mechanical device: It has limits of possibilities; i.e., limits of 
extremes. When the line hits the ceiling it cannot be a bottom, irrespective of how swell stocks or wheat 
look just then, or cotton as far as that goes or another commodity that is plotted. When the line reaches 
the other extreme on the minus side, we are near a low and we cannot expect another plunge. If the law 
or rather the mechanical device helps you only insofar as to prevent you from becoming too bullish at a 
top or too bearish right near a low, I have done some good with it. It is strange how the psychology of 
man runs when it comes to trading, but, a look at the volume of US Steel in the article discussed in this 
issue and considering the extreme levels when this happened in 1936, it ought to tell us enough. 
RULE: You use a centerline, which is called the zero line. Make on K&E dated paper a scale by calling 
each square 2 points. One square on K&E paper is the size as we use to enter a one-point fluctuation for 
a stock or lc for wheat. 
Use about 50 points for the plus side and a little less for the minus side, drawing the zero line 
through the middle of the sheet across (January 1 to December 31). Use a separate sheet or a plain 
copybook with several columns to calculate your values. In the first column comes the date. In the 
second column you enter the amount of the advance of the day (if any) compared to the previous day. 
Turn the eights into decimals such as: 2 5/8, which, you call 2.62; 1 1/8 you, call 1.12 or 1.13. 
We can make three different kinds of charts by using the three different advances possible from 
day to day: 
a) The advance from the closing price to the next closing price, 
b) The advance from the high price compared to the high price of the next day, 
c) The advance from the low price of one day compared to the low price of the next day. 
 I have used and tested all three, the pictures obtained are very similar and you may pick from a, 
b, c, the one that is easiest to use. I also have used the advance from the high and the advance from the 
low and later on, after fully calculating the figures put the two results in line form on one chart. The 
next columns you can't use until you have enough data piled up to enable you to do some figuring; you 
need actually 9 days performance in succession to obtain the first final value needed to make an entry 
on the chart. 
The whole idea is based on "weight", meaning the pressure that is exerted upon the stock or 
wheat price by traders, A straight arithmetical chart does not give results at all but when we use several 
days and weigh them accordingly, we have a good indicator. After I have demonstrated how to compile 
it, you will note that the values farthest back are the least weighed, while the greatest weight falls 
within the last three days of market action. It seems as if I am talking around the bush just now, but 
somehow, this method has grown in my head and never was put down in writing and here I realize how 
hard it is to put ideas like that down so that they make sense and can be understood.  
116
The whole combination is odd, as you will soon see, in that I weighed the upside in a 5-4 way 
while the downside I only weighed in a 3-3 way. This I did after long tests with all kinds of 
combinations and this one turned out to give the best results. 
You add for 5 consecutive days the daily advances and carry the figure thus obtained over into 
the adjoining column. This you keep up for a while omitting on the 6th day the figure used on the first 
day so that you add but five days each time which sum is to be carried over into the third column. Each 
day the new figure is carried out into the adjoining column until you have 4 new values in the adjoining 
third column. Then you begin to carry out in the fourth (next) column the total value of four such 
figures obtained. The value obtained and entered is the final value OF THE PLUS SIDE, or the side of 
the advance. 
The next, (5th) column you leave open for the time being. It will be used to enter therein the 
difference of the 4th column of plus and of the value coming from the minus side in order to get our 
final value which itself is added or deducted from the current value. For this current value a separate 
column is provided which is the value to be plotted on the chart. 
The remaining half of the columns are used to figure the values of the declines.*  
(*By decline I mean here the difference of yesterday's high for example as compared to to-day's high if such difference 
should become minus; this will happen when yesterday's high for wheat was 1. 07 ¾ while today’s high is 1.05.  This would 
give a value of---- 2 3/4 and this I call here the decline.) 
You enter in the next column the actual decline, if any, of the day compared to the previous 
trading day. If no decline, mark the entry as 0 (zero). This also applies to the side of the advance: if no 
advance, mark 0 and use the zero in the additions. 
You need on the decline side three figures of three consecutive days, which are carried out into 
a new column and of these new values you again need three figures to be carried over into the final 
column. 
This minus final is then deducted from the plus final, giving you either a plus or a minus figure, 
depending upon which side is bigger. This final figure is then entered in the center column and also 
plotted on the chart. Omit Sundays and holidays; do not enter them as zero on each side. 
An example will illustrate this much better: (assumed values): On page 5 (June issue, 1939) we 
have the wheat chart for Winnipeg from July 1937, which we can use to make comparisons to see the 
effect of this method when the line is plotted. (Ill. No. 19). The line illustrated was developed for 
Chicago Wheat from February 1937 to the November low (7th) 1937. 
Off hand, you may say: "I can't see anything out of this chart". Looking at it closer however, we 
discover that the line does not bend over unless we are coming to a top or a bottom. Furthermore, we 
see that we can only reach a certain limit on the down side, which is around minus 10. Whenever this 
level is reached we can buy wheat on weakness or wait for the day when the line actually bends 
upwards again. The kinks of July 29-31, 1937 and August 27th to August 31st 1937 had to be ignored 
since they did not occur near the extreme possible levels.                                               
 
117
I - 4th   and 11th ---Sunday or holiday, no entry made. 
* - Totals carried over from previous columns. 
It happens once in a while that a double kink is made near a top or near a bottom. If so, they are sure 
indications of a change of trend in the opposite direction such as is shown: July 17th-21st 1937, August 
5th-9th, September 24th-30th 1937. 
The beauty about this method is that you can establish already during the day the value, which 
has to be plotted approximately, especially, if you get quotations during trading hours or if you watch 
the market. It needs some practice. The values to be omitted are known and we can estimate those that 
have to be substituted for the next serial so as to obtain the new values for the end of the day. Many 
times the latter can be judged from the action of the market. 
The major trend cannot be discovered with this method. Of course, making a weekly index 
along the same way---using one Saturday and comparing it with the next one as explained for days---
will be an additional help towards recognizing trend. 
Mistakes in doing the figuring may prove very expensive and great care must be used in 
compiling. 
For commodities such as rubber, hides, cocoa, etc. we have to adjust the scale somewhat so that 
the line does not run off the page, but figuring out a series during a medium sized movement will 
quickly show the scale required. With stocks it is the same. Anyone who wants to plot the action of a 
low priced stock may have to double the fluctuations in order to get some sort of a movement into the 
line. The rules of interpretation and plotting remain the same. 
The difference between the two final values of plus and minus must be "attached'' to the line to 
get a continuance. They are not plotted or measured from the zero line each day, so that we need a 
column which we shall call "running value", to which we add or from which we deduct from day to day 
the differential of the 5- 4 column and the 3-3 column.  
In our example, which starts on the first of some month we can only begin plotting the 9th of the 
month. The previous compilation of figures is the "work-up" towards obtaining a final   value by 
weighing the 5- 4, 3-3 combination.

HINTS ON HOW TO ANALYZE AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK 
EXAMPLE: U.S. STEEL 
 
Under date of May 15, 1936, 9:50p.m.  I find the following entry in my notebooks. 
Analysis of U.S. Steel common, using Mercury in Longitude, alone. The analysis covers the 
period of January 21st to May 4th, 1936. As you will see from the way I shall bring this report, we have 
to take recourse to all kinds of tricks. We have do jump from one idea to another sometimes go back to 
the first idea again, at other times, abandon the original drift of thought altogether, since nothing 
tangible comes forth of it. 
It is an example of nearly four years ago, but astrological laws are good for all times (See 
Illustration No.16). 
The first step taken was to pick out tops and bottoms on whichever dates they were made. In the 
ephemeris for 1936 the position of Mercury on the day of a top as well as the position on the day of a 
bottom were looked up and noted. As next step we measured Mercury's motion from bottom to top. 
After that the positions at major turning points were grouped together. Note: that when the movement 
began, the price on January 21st 1936 for US Steel was 46 3/8 and compare that with the major drop 
from April 9th to May 4th 1936 required a Mercury movement   in   longitude of 460 16', which 
expressed in dollars amounts to 46 1/4-46 3/8. 
On January 21st, 1936 we had a bottom and the upward movement began. On February 10th we 
made a gap upwards, topping February 16th. Then we reacted to February 26th. From this day we 
rallied till March 6th and reacted till March 13th. Then we moved up again to March 19th and reacted 
to March 28th. On this day began the last rise to April 9th, which was the top of the movement. Then 
followed the big drop until May 4th 1936. In the early stage of the movement Mercury was in Aquarius 
and was just ready to turn retrograde. On March 12th, 1936 it went into Pisces and reached 40 36' 
Gemini by May 4th 1936. When measuring movements in degrees and minutes we have to reckon not 
only the movement forward but also the movement while the planet's motion is backwards (retrograde).  
From the low of January 2lst with Mercury at 17023' Aquarius we find that on January 23rd 
Mercury becomes retrograde at 17035' Aquarius. This gives us a planetary space movement of 12'.  The 
23rd of January was also a small top. We reacted to January 26th with Mercury at 170 2' Aquarius and a 
space movement in longitude of this planet of 33'. Then we went higher until February 5th, when 
Mercury reached 5038’ Aquarius; this space is 11024'. We reacted to the 8th, Mercury at 3054' Aquarius 
and a space of l044'. Another comeback until February 8th, Mercury at 20 9' Aquarius, a space of 1045'. 
At this place a gap was made upward and a new cycle began. The total movement from January 21st to 
this gap was 150 38'. 
In the meantime, Mercury became direct again (moving forward) and at the top of the 
movement (after the gap).  February 17th, we find Mercury at 2057' direct in Aquarius. This was a space 
movement of 56'. From the top of February 17th to the low of February 26th we have a space of 60 56', 
since Mercury reached that time 90 53' Aquarius. 
From the gap of February 10th to the bottom of February 26th Mercury moved all told  70 52' 
and from the very low of January 21st to this bottom it moved 230 30'. 
Mercury on March 6th, 1936 is at 200 31' Aquarius or 100 38' further than at the low of February 
26th. US Steel reacted then till March 13th when Mercury is at 00 20' Pisces, covering a space of 90 49'. 
The up and down swing covered a space of 200 37'.  
Mercury began to run faster now, after having been rather slow in its motion due to its 
retrograde movement. On March 19th we had a top in Steel when Mercury reached 9038' Pisces, having 
progressed in its motion since the 13th of the month 9018'. 
121
 
There were six stages in this complete movement: 
 
1.  
Accumulation, January 21 to February 8 
 
 
319,500 
2.  
The push upwards February 10 to February 26

6.  
Decline (selling) April 9 to March 4, 1936.  
 
659,800 
 
1,088,100
122
 
We reacted until March 28th when Mercury was at 250 1’Pisces after it had moved 150 23'. These 
last two swings amounted to 240 41'. 
From the 28th of March to April 9th Mercury moved 230 19' to 180 20' Aries. Compare this 
value with the two previous double swing movements of 200 37' and 240 41' respectively. April 9th was 
the peak of the swing. 
During the drop resulting from the entire upswing of January 21st to April 9th Mercury moved 
460 16' further to 40 36' Gemini reached by May 4th, 1936. 
The price on April 9th was 72 3/8, a rise of 26 points (see Table 15, page 86). The rise 
according to Table15 amounted to14 units; let us also have a glance at Table14, where it shows that 14 
units is a cycle. 
The total upward movement in Mercury's longitudinal motion from January 21st to April 9th 
was 920 7' and the decline from that date to May 4th was 460 16', a ratio of 2: 1. 
Now we check the volume of trading during this period (Table17) whereby I do not include the 
volume of January 21st 1936 since this volume apparently belongs to the previous cycle. 
This was my finding: 
Buyers who make commitments during accumulation get out in the distribution area. 
Buyers who buy during the push are stuck; they don't sell. 
Swing buyers sell on the decline that follows. 
The upward movement from January 21st 1936 developed with rather small volume, averaging 
15,000 shares a day. When the gap upward was made on February 10th 1936, volume came into steel 
and four to six times as many people wanted US Steel compared with the two previous weeks. After 
this demand was satisfied, volume dropped off again, so that the last half of March 1936 found us in the 
normal. 10-15,000 volume per day. The next volume period appeared right at the top, when nearly 
200,000 shares were "handed over" to the bulls. During the actual decline volume was fairly high, but 
increased as we reached the bottom. Just a day or two before the actual bottom we find the same 
amount of volume as was obtained when Steel made the gap upwards February 10th, 1936. 
Coming now back to the Mercury motion during this period, we note that the entire movement 
from January 21st 1936 to May 4th 1936 was 1380 23', or 920 7' plus 460 16'. 
The entire retrograde movement of Mercury from January 23 to February 13 1936 was 150 42'. 
We note that the upward movement from January 21st to the February 10th gap meant a motion of 
15038' in Mercury, which is nearly the same as the amount of the total retrograde motion of Mercury. 
The total amount of Mercury motion between bottom and bottom (January 21st to May 4th, 1936) was 
giving us 1380 23'. This value equals 9 times 150 25'. In the following Table we have an adjustment of 
20' to take care of so as to agree with the other values, but this does not matter in the case at the 
moment: 
 
SERIES TABLE OF 150 25' (Table No. 18) 
 
1. 150 25'  
 
6. 920 30' 
2. 300 50' 
 
7 1070 55' 
3. 460 15' 
 
8 1230 20' 
4. 610 40' 
 
9 1380 45'  
5. 770 05' 
 
Of course, in everything the center is of importance. Since we have made a division of 9 the 
center becomes 4 1/2. Therefore, 4 units equals 610 40' and 1/2 unit of 150 25' equals 70 42', a total of 
680 22'. This point was reached in Mercury motion on March 28th, 1936. It was one of the most critical 
points during the movement as we can readily see from Illustration 16. 
 
Under date of May 16th, 1936 I have the following entries. 
123
 
Since I have shown in "Time Factors" that the circle should really be taken as having not 3600
but 3680 6' which is the cycle of Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions repetitions, and since I always stress the 
value of 24 hours or 24 units, we can make a corrected scale covering and exploiting the results found 
yesterday, by making a division of 24 into the 3680 6', cycle: Table No. 19. 
 
1/24 of 3680 06' is 150 20' 15"; this we call 1 unit.

This cycle gives us a mathematical cause for the rhythm shown in the US Steel's movement 
during the spring of 1936. 
In wheat we can decipher three distinct cycles that repeat rather regularly producing tops and 
bottoms sometimes bottom-bottom also top-top. These values are: 200 30', 590 20', 1400 00' 
These values pertain also to the Mercury longitudinal motion only. No other planet is considered 
with this. Make tests such as we did for US Steel. 
All Mercury values were taken from Raphael's Ephemeris; they are figured for noon London of 
each day, or 7 am, New York time. 
 
FORECASTS OF MARKETS FOR FEBRUARY, 1940 
 
STOCKS. 
 
The forecast for the second half of January 1940 should prove to be wrong as I can see at the 
time of writing this forecast (January 7th 1940). It should have read: we sell off to the 27th or 28th of 
January, then get a rally into early February. It is a good thing that the reaction, in case we bought mid-
January, will not hurt us too much since the 144 levels ought to stem it. 
 I have done a lot of revising on my work the last few weeks and as far as stocks are concerned, 
I am changing here my mind that instead of a bear year we are due for a bull year which is due to start 
with the 28th of January 1940.  So let us get into our mind a more cheerful picture than the one we had 
developed. The last few days (January 20th to 28th) could be somewhat wicked on the downside, but 
from then on a complete change of atmosphere should come. A small top is shown for February 8th 
with a kink to the 13th or 14th of the month; after   that a slow rise to the 22nd--a sharp gap due to 
124
come which should run into the month of March upward, fast, with another gap to jump over the tops of 
early January, crossing at the same time   over the peaks of November 1938 (Nov.10th) as well as the 
one of last Fall (September 7th, 1939).         
Mr. Gann says in his book. "He who does not change his mind will pretty soon have no more 
change to mind.” This is why I change my mind having very satisfactory proved and tested reasons for 
doing so. 
 
WHEAT. 
For wheat the 28th of January should also become an important low; we may have reached the 
94cent level in May, Chicago by that time, but whatever should be the price, would cover shorts and 
take the long side. We should move up slowly from then into February, would not look for selling spots 
or for temporary short position possibilities, but hold longs. The day of action should become February 
22nd and no question about that. The cat should jump upwards on that day and run right into March. 
Watch this day! If a gap is made upwards even though it may be small, take on some more wheat and 
hold it. Let's look for $1.45 in wheat. 
 
COTTON indicates also a low for the 28th of January. It is, however so strong that it will not find time 
for reactions during February, but keep right on stepping up with a gap or two upwards during   the 
performance. Hold into March. 
HIDES. While hides show a very strong trend upwards after February 22nd 1940, up to that time it 
should idle somewhat, so that a rally which develops after January 28th 1940 should peter out and the 
low of January 28th be reached again by February 22nd, a mad jump is shown from this time on. It 
should become the best commodity of the lot. 
BUTTER shows a rally from 3rd on, but not much longer than to the end of the month. 
EGGS should be at a low as we go into February and rally during February. 
COCOA shows the same tendency. 
RUBBER points to a strong rise as we enter the month and so does Lard and Cottonseed Oil. SILK 
should be bought back by the 8th of February for a good run. 
BARLEY, rye, corn and oats should join the movement of wheat. 
I feel much more happy about this discovery. It has been checked and double checked to make sure we 
don't make any blunder. 
Thus January 28th should be a low, upward from then on, or in some commodities at least some 
strength; then watch February 22nd(Winnipeg is open) for the general gap upward. This day should 
constitute the jump-off point, a similar situation as prevailed on September 1st, 1939.
STOCK AVERAGES 1872-1898 ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH MONTH 
 
Oftentimes the conversation about markets leads towards the question:  What has the market done 
before Mr Dow got up??  The idea to add a number of stocks together so as to obtain a “mean”, a 
broader view about the action of the market in general? 
On August 20, 1935, as my record shows, I wanted to know just the answer to this question.  This 
desire made me march down to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, through low built halls, inside 
of heavy barred windows, into one certain room.   
 
125
In this room I made a copy of the following: 
 
These are the averages figured out by the Federal Reserve Bank for the 1st of each month given, 
weighing the same or similar stocks as carried by Dow Jones. Aren’t we glad, that we have not been 
able to trade in the stock market between September 1877 and August 1879?  We can find two bull 
periods during all these years, one in 1881 and the other in 1892. 
 
126
ABOUT AL KORAN OF MOHAMMED 
 
The average reader of magazines who happens to get a copy of  “Previews” will get queer feelings into his 
bones when he reads some of my articles. To him they may give no sense whatever and if they do, he 
becomes so bewildered about the contents and deductions that he probably will lay it aside. 
 
A story, which tells him that the ancients thought the Earth, was square, that their Gods were 
nothing but planets and Sun he readily believes as true. When I say that these ancients knew much more 
about the movements of Mercury whom very few contemporaries ever have seen, they will not believe it. 
But, these ancients had it all over us; they knew exactly what to use to get all movements, of you and me, 
of wheat and of anything else, by using certain planets in various positions. 
 
In this issue I shall give you some hints on the Koran.  I have one copy, 2 vol. By George Sale, 
printed in London, in 1795. It is 145 years old. My two-volume set is brand new, having come from a 
private library that was auctioned off a few years ago in New York. In these volumes I had to cut open the 
pages since its purpose so far had been reserved to decorate illustrious homes.  Another copy I have which 
is contained in ‘Sacred Books,” 12 vol. Published in 1917. In the latter set, in vol. V, page 43, that author 
says in his introduction: “A famous Oriental critic once said that the best way to understand the Koran was 
to begin with the last chapter and work forward. This suggestion is really worth following.” Make your 
own comment about what these two fellows know about the Koran!  I know that they know as little as I 
know about Chinese, zero. 
 
The other author, who must be dead and buried a hundred years, won’t get hurt much of what I say 
bout him. He says in his introduction: “I imagine it almost needless wither to make an apology for 
publishing the following translation or to go about to PROVE it is a work of use as well as CURIOSITY. 
They must have a mean opinion of the Christian religion or be but ill-grounded therein, who can apprehend 
any danger from so manifest a FORGERY: and if the religions and civil institutions of foreign nations are 
worth our knowledge, those of Mohammed, the law-giver of the Arabians, and founder of an empire, 
which, in less than a century, spread itself over a greater part of the world that the Romans were ever 
masters of, must needs be so; whether we consider their extensive obtaining, or our frequent intercourse 
with this who are governed thereby.  I shall not inquire here into the reasons why the law of Mohammed 
had met with so UNEXAMPLED a reception in the world, for they are greatly deceived who imagine it to 
have been propagated by the sword alone or by what means it came to be embraced by nations which never 
felt the force of the Mohammedan arms, and even by those which stripped the Arabians of their conquests, 
and put an end to the sovereignty and very being of their Khalifs: yet it seems as if there was something 
more than what is vulgarly imagined, in a religion which has make so surprising a progress.”  Further on he 
says: “The Protestants alone are able to attack the Koran with success, and for them, I trust, Providence has 
reserved the GLORY of its overthrow.  In the meantime, if I might presume to lay down rules to be 
OBSERVED by those who attempt the CONVERSION of the Mohammedans, they should be the same 
which the LEARNED and WORTHY bishop Kidder (he kidded himself) has pre scribed for the 
CONVERSION OF THE JEWS, and which may, mutatis mutandis, be EQUALLY applied to the former, 
notwithstanding the despicable opinion that writer for want of being better acquainted with them, 
entertained of those people, judging them scarce fit to be argued with. The first rule is to avoid compulsion; 
which though it be not in OUR POWER AT PRESENT (!), I hope will not be made use of when it IS. The 
second is: To avoid teaching doctrines against common sense; the Mohammedans not being such fools (as 
he who wrote these rules), whatever we may think of them, as to be gained over in this case. The 
worshipping of images, and the doctrine of trans-substantiation are great stumbling blocks to the 
Mohammedans and the church which teach- eth them is very unfit to bring those peoples over. (whereto?) 
For how criminal so ever Mohammed may have been in imposing a false religion on mankind, the praises 
due to his real virtues ought not to be denied to him." 
127
Several more rules follow, but we have enough to chew on these here. 
 
What a nerve that fellow had to call the Koran a forgery! He is at a loss to understand why such 
a forgery could spread faster than his own Christian religion, because he does not know that it MUST 
have been started at an even more propitious moment than they were able to start the Jewish or the 
Christian religion. "I shall not inquire here into the reasons....", poor wretch, you don't even have a 
reams "Yet," he says "there was something more than what is vulgarly imagined, in a religion which 
has made so surprising a progress." You bet, dead boy, there is, but you never lived that long to learn 
about it. 
Looking 145 years back from here, what the Protestants were supposed to do to the 
Mohammedans and the rules, which he laid down, assisted by a fellow who bore the proper name (Mr. 
Kidder), needs no comment. He didn't forget the Jews either, how he was going to take care of them. 
See my article about Mr. Simpson on page 115. 
We must not condemn the poor fellow for all these wrong conclusions; he did us a great service 
by translating the Koran. He states somewhere that he translated it as carefully as he could, retaining the 
wordings. This is just what he was supposed to do. Had he used his own way, a mess similar to his 
introduction would have resulted and the thing would have been worthiest altogether. 
All these Bibles and holy books don't do us much good if we don't know what to do with them 
for our purpose (that of trading). I am not speaking of religion whatever. I am not a preacher; my sole 
purpose is to analyze stocks and commodities in a sensible way. For this purpose we have to use holy 
books. To get it over with quickly, I am going to bring here a portion of the second chapter of A1 Koran 
as translated by George Sale, and below I bring a dictionary of my own production of many words that 
are found therein, translated into the right language. You may take my work as being just as crazy as 
the laws given by George Sale back in 1795 how to convert Jews and Mohammedans to Protestantism, 
but that's all right with me.

AL KORAN. Chapter II, The Cow. (Actual Text) 
 
There is no doubt in this book; it is a direction to the pious, who believe in the mysteries of faith 
who observe the appointed times of prayer, and distribute alms out of what we have bestowed upon 
them; and who believe in that revelation, which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath 
been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and have firm assurance in the life to come: these are 
directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper. As for the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether 
thou admonish them or do not admonish them, they will not believe. God has sealed up their hearts and 
their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment. There are 
some who say, we believe in God, and the last day; but are not really believers; they seek to deceive 
God, and those who do believe, but they deceive only themselves, and are not sensible thereof. There is 
an infirmity in their hearts, and God hath increased this infirmity; and they shall suffer the most painful 
punishment, because they have disbelieved. When one saith to them, act not corruptly in the earth; they 
reply, verily, we are men of integrity. Are they not themselves corrupt-doers? But they are not sensible 
thereof, and when one saith unto them, believe ye as others believe, they answer, shall we believe as 
fools believe? Are not they fools themselves? But they know it not. When they meet those who believe, 
they say, we do believe; but when they retire privately to their devils, they say, we really hold with you, 
and only mock those people; God shall mock at them and continue them in their impiety; they shall 
wander in confusion. These are the men who have purchased error at the price of true direction; but 
their traffic hath not been gainful, neither have they been rightly directed. They are like unto one who 
kindleth a fire, and when it has enlightened him all around him; God taketh away their light and leaveth 
them in darkness, they shall not see; they are deaf, dumb and blind, therefore will they not repent. Or 
like a stormy cloud from heaven, fraught with darkness, thunder and lightning, they put their fingers in 
their ears because of the noise of the thunder for fear of death; God encompasseth the infidels; the 
lightning wanteth but little of taking away their sight; so often as it enlighteneth them, they walk 
therein, but when darkness cometh on them, they stand still; and if God so pleased he would certainly 
deprive them of their hearing and their sight, for God is almighty. O men of Mecca, serve your Lord 
who hath created you, and those who have been before you; peradventure ye will fear him; who hath 
spread the earth before you, and the heaven as a covering, and hath caused water to descend from 
heaven and thereby produced fruits for your sustenance. Set not up therefore any equals unto God, 
against your own knowledge. If ye be in doubt concerning that revelation which we have sent down 
unto our servant, produce a chapter like unto it and call upon your witnesses, besides God, if ye say 
truth. 
But if ye do it not, nor shall ever be able to do it; justly fear the fire whose fewel is men and 
stones, prepared for the unbelievers. But bear good tidings unto those who believe, and do good works, 
that they shall have gardens watered by rivers; so often as they eat of the fruit thereof for sustenance, 
they shall say: this is what we have formerly eaten of; and they shall be supplied with several sorts of 
fruit having a mutual resemblance to one another.

Bayer's Translation of Part of The Cow. 
 
Everything written in Al Koran consists of facts. Whatever is written is intended for people, 
(traders in this case), who want to study the laws of astrology the right way, by using heliocentric 
astrology; they should use definite cycles, draw lines and make cycles the way we shall show them. 
People, we begin with the laws, we explain them for you, you check carefully what has happened in 
previous cycles if you have faith in heliocentric astrology. (This shows that the ancients were not as 
dumb as the present generation takes them; they knew that the earth moves around the Sun, they also 
knew of the two planetary measurements, which can be used: 
 1) As we see the planets from the earth; this is called the geocentric position of a planet. This 
approach is used in textbooks; 
 2) As we see a planet from the Sun; this is called the heliocentric position of a planet, and this 
type of astrology is explained in the Holy Scriptures, in the myths, in 1001 Nights, in Bocaccio and in 
other ancient works. The reason why nobody ever thinks of that is plain. They take the ancients as 
having been a bunch of deaf, dumb and blind fellows, who were sorely in need of an education such the 
present generation only can supply. 
They are guided by a certain line and with it they will get results. (By that "line" is not meant 
what geocentric workers call Ascendant and Descendants neither MC and Nadir. What it is, I shall let 
you find for yourself.) To geocentric astrologers it will make little difference whether you tell them 
about it or not; they won't throw their rubbish overboard; they just refuse to listen. The line spoken of 
interferes with the direct and retrograde motion of their pets; something prevents them to "see" and just 
for that reason they will constantly get themselves into "hot water" when they use their type of 
astrology. There are some who say: "We use that line" and the previous cycle; but just the same, they 
do not use it right. They try to substitute or change the line the same way as they try to show those who 
use helio laws that their geocentric work is better. But they "deceive" (here the word must be used in 
the usual meaning) only themselves and are not even noticing it. There is a weakness in their birth lines 
and their "special" line might also be weak, so that they are bound to run themselves into troubles since 
they don't start right. When one says to them: don't start the wrong way, don't use geocentric astrology,* 
they reply: verily we know what we are doing. Don't they start wrong, I ask you, and don't even feel it? 
And when one says to them, use helio astrology as we do, they answer: Shall we act like fools? Are 
they not "fools" (this means Beings on this earth) themselves who don't figure that far ahead? When 
they meet people operating with helio astrology (planets), they say: yes, it ought to give results, too; 
but, when they retire privately to their geocentric planets they say: we love you, we can look you up, as 
to what you mean, in astrological texts, which are sold to the masses, who ought to know and who 
ridicule those people who use heliocentric astrology. The "special line" shall take care of them and keep 
them where they are; they shall always be confused in their deductions. These are people who have 
bought "mass astrology" instead of the Holy Scriptures. But their results have not been profitable, since 
they can't do anything with it. They are like one who started to study astrology and when he is all 
inflamed and excited about that which he thinks he can predict, the "special line" spoken of above 
makes a change and this change completely changes the effect of all planet's positions, angles and what 
have you and then their laws don't work at all any more for a while and they can't understand why this 
is possible; they shall not find out about it either since they are deaf, dumb and blind and therefore they 
will not change their methods. (Here fits a case of a friend of mine who, back in 1933 had worked up a 
method of counting which he started during the Bank Holidays 1933. It was plotted on a chart and-there 
was not a top or a bottom in stocks that had escaped; each top and each bottom was located from 
March, 1933, until October 21st, 1933. On that day he had a low and it was the low point. We sat that 
day together out on Long Island and he said to me: From now on I am going to put my money on this 
130
"system", as he termed it. Yes, he did put it on, but in the three months, which followed it cost him 
$4560; since "God took away his light and left him in darkness." In fact, that method stopped working 
on October 21st, 1933, and has not worked since. Such is the case with hundreds of methods that are 
fine on the surface but in practice they bring losses as soon as they are used. In my practice, clients 
have sent me many of their pet methods, some trying to help further my own work, some with the idea 
that I would check up and possibly try to improve these methods, all acting in good faith. Invariably I 
have to tell them: too dangerous for practical use. It's hard to let go of a pet. Pet methods are the ruin of 
many traders, since all these are methods of ''Unbelievers" as Mohammed calls them. 
When a heliocentric line (of a planet) comes downward having as "effect" a major drop, a gap 
down and a few long lines down (on the charts), they hold their heads since this move was not in their 
cards; they are afraid this move will never end; the "special line" had crossed geocentric lines. The 
break in prices wanted but little of taking away all their funds; whenever it crosses them upward it's 
OK, but when it crosses downward, hell gets loose; they go retrograde. 
0 men of the present generation, use the cycle that has started all the troubles as well as the cycles that 
were before, maybe you will find the line I am talking about, the line which uses geocentric positions 
below you and heliocentric positions above you and which brings it about that a line comes down from 
the helio part and that way makes conjunctions for your benefit. Do therefore not substitute any other 
lines, if you know better. Should you be in doubt about this law which we explained herewith to the 
students, try various lines and see if they answer my explanations and check for proofs whether they all 
work as well as the "special line" which I explain here in hidden words. Unless you do find this line, 
give up all astrology, since it is this one line on which everything that follows is based on. First, find 
out that planets affect our lives and begin with the astrology whose rules include angles and 
conjunctions as used by geocentric astrologers; then switch over to the right work and do heliocentric 
work, which shall bring results. Whenever you reach points of geocentric conjunctions, you will say: 
this is what I have formerly used; there will be several conjunctions that have mutual resemblance to 
geocentric conjunctions. 
 
(*Note that Mohammed find it below his dignity to consider even people who use the rain in the Middle 
West or those who use steel output or Kilowatt production to determine movements of commodities and 
stocks.  He evaluates geocentric astrologers as having a possibility “to be saved.”) 
With this special article I have let another cat out of the bag and I hope some of you will benefit. The 
many years I have used myself geocentric astrology for want of any other have not been wasted time. It 
gave me the base, believing, like others do, that we are on the planet earth and therefore all planetary 
effects must operate on how we see the planets from this earth. Many years ago when I got hold of an 
ephemeris of 1792, I was wondering about that it contained also the heliocentric positions of the 
planets. It kept me thinking why they were printed. Conversations with other people who were 
supposed to be up on astrology, constantly led towards the explanation given above, that we, as 
inhabitants of this earth, have nothing to do with planets as they can be seen from the Sun. And it was 
these "devilish" ideas that kept me on earth for many years, until, like Enoch, I moved one day up to 
heaven to stay there. Only once a month I had to come down, writing articles for "Previews," thinking 
in geocentric terms that all of you as geocentric students would understand. But, as it is, patience has an 
end. I am fed up to think geocentrically, when I know and practice for many years solely the study of 
heliocentric astrology. 
You now may say: where can I get a book teaching me heliocentric astrology. There are no new 
books on this subject and, if there are any, anywhere, I would not suggest them for study. The only 
books that teach helio astrology are the Scriptures and allied works, of which we talk right along in 
"Previews." So, the best heliocentric astrology book you can get at Woolworth's for a quarter, plus tax. 
131
When we look over old books of the 15th and 16th century, we often find pictures of alchemists. 
Old bewhiskered men are seen in laboratories among vials and retorts; fat pig-skin bound books are 
seen lying next to them; as "they" tell us, these fellows were trying to make gold out of other chemicals. 
However, gold in the astrological sense is not the gold, which is used for ornaments or for 
minting coins. Gold means that "special line" that throws all ordinary astrological methods at any 
unexpected time onto confusion. These old fellows have been trying to find this "special line". They did 
not want others to get wise to what they were looking for (unfortunately, they could not find it either), 
so they filled up their workshops with vials and chemicals in case anybody would drop in to snoop 
around. If so, the snoopers could suspect nothing and would not be wiser than before. In fact, it would 
give them ideas, which the researchers wanted them to have. So the alchemist’s stories and pictures 
present another farce and a cover of the real doings of these people. 
They knew that, if they could find this "special line", it would be the real "gold line." 
 
THE CATERPILLARS 
 
When a trend in the market or in a particular commodity has been started, it lasts for quite some 
time. By "time" I mean eight months to a year, once in a while even longer. Let us begin to follow one 
of these movements upwards (the very same rule applies downwards, only remember, declines are of 
shorter duration in "time" and therefore much steeper, since it takes less time to tear down a house than 
it takes to build one). 
Speed around a low is very slow; price changes are very small. At fairly regular intervals a 
reaction sets in and those who still are used to play the bear side having gotten used to it from the 
previous major decline, will sell short at all opportunities but cover these shorts higher up. The general 
formation shows “hooks,” sort of fishhooks, of which the longer part forms the upswing and the shorter 
part, on which the tiny “hook” is attached, forms the downswing. As the rise keeps up for a while, 
consisting of several such hooks regularly attached to one another, we can define a picture, which looks 
like a caterpillar winding its way upward. As we go higher, there appear larger hooks. The proportion 
of the one side of the hook compared to the other side of the hook is nearly always the same from one 
hook to the other. The higher we go, the bigger the fluctuations. There will be a time coming when we 
feel as if the "real up move" is now beginning. When this feeling overcomes a regular trader I say: 
instead of getting more bullish and instead of using all profits that have accrued to buy more and more, 
it is time to get out of the long side. 
Yesterday, January 29th, I had lunch over at Watsonville, in the Pajaro Valley. The soup tasted 
fine, because I was hungry (the up move started for my intestinal system); the salad was enjoyed too, 
which we shall call a "gap upwards"; the meat was swell, chicken giblets, rice, mashed potatoes, string 
beans and plenty of curried gravy. Halfway finished with this dish I began to breathe deeply and said to 
my boss: "I just feel like wheat when it is at the top."  I kept on eating at a slower speed, but the feeling 
of hunger (of the up move) was gone and I "should" have stopped. "I should have," but I didn't; I did 
what all traders do when a top is reached. They keep on buying and I kept on eating. The caterpillar, the 
"tube" which leads to the stomach, was filled so that it just simply could not stand any more food. 
(Please imagine for our illustration of a bull movement that the stomach is above or caterpillar runs up 
to it). I could not resist the sweetest thing of all, the huckleberry pie. Stocks and commodities look the 
sweetest right on the top, so good that even the public has to buy them. Now, since I told you all about 
that meal, I also will tell you that shortly thereafter I felt really miserable. I should not have eaten that 
pie. It was simply the reaction that comes after the top is made. That extra piece caused the trouble. In 
the market, it defines that period when stocks have made a top (had enough) when they jiggle around so 
132
beautifully at the top, while they are just waiting for the moment that planets say: "down with you". 
This period does not have the form and shape of a caterpillar or of fish hooks joined together. It pictures 
on the chart like something all "blown-up," a half-moon, in some cases it forms a sidewise movement in 
narrow range with big volume. To point out exact cases for comparison, look at the wool-tops chart 
from end December to mid-January 1940. It illustrates the "half-moon" which after ward sinks down to 
produces a sharp drop. For the second case explained look at cotton in the same period end of 
December to mid-January 1940. 
The first sharp break always has a comeback, the same way as when we drop a ball to the 
ground it bounces up again. This bounce back "they" call: "over-sold" condition. Prices rise very 
sharply, but miss the old highs. At that time begins also the caterpillar formation downwards, first fast, 
then gradually slower; each successive top is lower compared to the previous top until finally, after 
many months, we reach a bottom. There we stay for quite a while. 
How do we recognize bottoms? They are easy to recognize because at that time you begin to 
worry about eighths. When you buy wheat at 61 1/8 and try to sell it at 61 7/8 and the blame thing only 
goes to 61 3/4, turns down and breaks 61 1 /8 and when you then reverse and double up for the down 
side at 60 7/8, but as soon as you are short it is up at 61 7/8, you worry terribly at that time. You are at a 
loss what will happen. The world seems to have an end because…..wheat is at a low and you don't feel 
it. On the other side, when wheat sells at 1.10, drops in a few days to 98, runs up to l.07 again your 
feeling is: what the……just a little reaction, nothing to it; you begin to put out a small short after it hit 
1.10, say at 1.05; you ride it down, but before you know it, the price is back to 1.07.  If you then get 
into a state where you send to me a wire as follows: "Shall I cover shorts and reverse to long side, quick 
answer appreciated," then you are in the same state as you were at the bottom. You don't see the top. 
The first case happened in Buffalo, N.Y., August 1939; the second case occurred at Laramie, Wyo., 
early in January 1940. 
When you begin to worry about eighth after a long decline, when you don't care about any 
limits, after long advance, then the stocks or commodities which you trade have reached their outside 
limits, Then it's time to reverse positions. 
Be sure to keep daily high and low charts; they are very important, else you can't see the 
caterpillars, nor understand my lunch example. Pictures or formations develop very fast as soon as you 
have plotted a chart for a month or so. 
 
CALL FOR MR SIMPSON! 
(Melody: Call for Philip Morris!) 
 
A few years ago I happened to get from a "prospective client" of a certain trader a ready-made 
agreement, which this client was supposed to sign. 
It was a matter of taking over the account of this client and trade it on a profit-sharing 
arrangement between client and this trader. Such things are done right along. Even I do trade for clients 
that way. But, whoever the prospective client might have been whom this trader approached, the client, 
if he had any knowledge of astrological laws, could have seen immediately the outcome of such trading 
without knowing anything about the man who approached him to trade his account. 
Without revealing the name of the trader who solicited trading accounts we shall call him Mr. 
X. This Mr. X made up sample contracts or agreements, whereby he printed the name of the party of 
the second part as Mr. Simpson. (Anyone whose name may be Simpson, please do not get offended 
with what follows, it is a mere illustration of the case at hand i.e., my personal interpretation of the 
name Simpson as used by that party Mr. X in this case.) The prospective client, provided he was 
satisfied with this type of agreement was then to receive a regular agreement, into which his right name 
was then inserted. Mr. X, when writing his sample agreement, no doubt, wanted to use a name that was 
133
common and often used, without giving any thought to the effect such name would have between a 
trader and his client, in that he felt no client would have anything to criticize about the use of a common 
name like Simpson in a sample contract. 
Anyhow, the agreement began:  
 It is agreed between Mr. X, party of the first part and Mr. Simpson, party of the second part, 
that...... etc., many lines followed in the usual form such agreements are made. 
To you, so far, such a formal agreement is just another form. To me, however, the minute I saw 
the name "Mr. Simpson," being the party of the second part, i.e., the client, brought home the RESULT 
of this agreement whoever signed it and gave this party the authority to trade the account. 
Here is the reason: This Mr. X did not write what he wanted to write; he wrote in the "sample'' 
contract that what was due to happen to Mr. Simpson before he ever started trading for him, namely:  
It is agreed between Mr. X, party of the first part and between the SON of Mr. Simp, party of 
the second part that...... etc. 
He who signed it was the "Simp" 's son. 
In the Talmud we find a Rabbi whose name is: Aha! 
Since he was a son, he could never have been a big fellow; this idea is worth noting too, And, 
the big fellow most likely would not have stood for Simp-son, but, since there are also big fellows who 
make big blunders, this Mr. X might have succeeded with them if he would have used for the party of 
the second part the name of Simp-lon.

ABOUT TWO BOOKS 
 
Recently a 5 vol, work of Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae came into my possession. 
It deals with dinner talks, about foods. However, it is an astrological work. 
In vol. I, page 9 it says: “Larensius was well versed in the religious ceremonies established by 
Romulus, who gave his name to Rome, and by Numa Pompilius, and he was learned in political 
institutions. All this he had acquired UNAIDED, BY THE STUDY OF ANCIENT DEGREES and 
from the COMPILATION OF LAWS WHICH THE JURISTS NO LONGER TEACH.” 
“They were already SEALED BOOKS.” 
He is talking here about astrological laws such as used in the Scriptures, which have been lost at 
the time already when this work had been written. 
 From this we can deduct that it is possible to discover these ancient laws again, provided time 
and effort is spent studying those ancient works. It is a curious thing that most all translations carry the 
notation "translated literally." As foolish as some sentences or even whole chapters sound to the 
translator, he translates them exactly as the original shows.  This he does for only one reason: he doesn't 
know what the mess is all about. He gets a subconscious feeling that he might omit or change 
something that is essential for students of this type of work. Therefore, we have to assume that the 
ancients were even able to incorporate in their starting point the insurance of a literal translation for 
later generations. 
Another book which may be worth studying to form proper ideas concerning our work is: "Is it 
God's Word ," by Joseph Wheless, published in New York 1926, by Alfred A. Knopf. This book 
attempts to bring comparisons between various types of religions, analyzes sections and chapters of the 
Scriptures. In case you do acquire this book, consider that it is written by a man who does not use 
astrology whatever, but looks at it with the eye of the average man. Some of his logic is very fine, 
especially so, when we constantly keep in mind that the works are nothing but astrological laws, that he 
speaks of planets, of their movements in the heaven, how they affect the human brains. Of course, his 
134
chapter XII is not so good where he writes about "Bible Theology and modern Truth." In this chapter he 
brings "Conflict between science and religion" is the same as "Knowledge and the outpourings of 
Moses." Every path of Natural science is closed with the sign: "No thoroughfare, Mr. Moses." That this 
modern view is a lot of humbug I believe I have amply shown at various points of "Preview." As I 
stated recently, if human beings and especially scientists would accept the law: Man's will is a big Zero, 
there would be no more signs:  "We moderns have no more use for Moses."  Of course, it make a 
tremendous difference whether you call Moses Mr. Mercury or whether you believe him to be a person 
who lived some time ago and who led the Jews through the desert. Of course, should you go that far as 
to call Moses Mercury, you may just as well give the Jews a name of a planet, may be even two names 
since they are always used in the plural form and call the desert a certain sector in the Zodiac. 
Mr. Moses will be with us whether the "Moderns" want him or not. Such ideas border on 
atheism as far as I can judge; however, our own work brings out the true theism and that theism which 
was taught in the Scriptures. Never forget that there is a God. Who he is and what he is, that's another 
story. But someone moves wheat and stocks at his will and it is not the "insider" or groups of Zeros as 
some believe. 
Many examples are brought in this book, showing that this and that could not be or could not 
have happened. For example, on page 259 he talks about the snake, about the earth not being round. 
Now, to these modern wizards, of course it CANNOT BE. To me it is, since I call the serpent the 
latitude of a planet which winds itself snake-like around; the earth cannot be round according to the 
Bible since it is but a certain line (not the Ecliptic nor the Equator), that has to be drawn representing a 
center line. This is also why he quotes someone who said: Antipodians are theologically impossible, 
and look all the people living south of the Equator! Mr. Modern you are all wet. He does not mean 
these people at all. What he was talking about simply that below that line which represents the earth are 
not human beings, since the lines down below that earth line are the dead or inactive ones which get 
revived when they come above the earth again…. Do you, dear reader understand what I mean? Do you 
understand now that all these commentaries of the Bible written by bishops and others are not worth 
even looking at? You just continue in the line of thought as I explained above and you will get into 
Eden; you will see Adam and Eve there, you will see the sneaky snake too how she arts and why and 
when. 
 
FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR THE 
 MONTH OF MARCH 1940 
 
In the article of Al Koran I have told you about the fellow who used a watertight method from 
March 1933 to Oct 21st 1933, wherewith to catch each movement in stocks, but that after that date the 
method just simply went flooey. A similar condition I am facing at this stage with my stock forecast. As 
you well know, my stocks forecast while not 100 per cent right has been for many years hitting pretty 
well, especially during periods when the public at large did not expect a movement of the sort to 
develop. 
When mid-January 1940 came around, I noticed for the first time that the rally slated from mid-January 
in stocks could not very well develop. This was deducted by me, through the actual performance of the 
market during the first two weeks of January 1940, aside of several other factors which I use to discover 
the nearby trend. It was obvious that we could not run up from mid-January, that I mentioned it yet in 
the February issue so that you could take proper steps to prevent losses. My forecast method for that 
matter, is not out like a light, however, I saw immediately that the whole thing was a matter of a 100 
per cent turnabout face and that is that. That "special line" spoken of in "Al Koran" has something to do 
135
with it. 
Therefore, as stated in February "Preview," we should have to do here with a low during 
February and a gradual climb for several months. The way the March picture in stocks should run off is 
as follows: 
As we enter the month, the market should have a very small reaction to the 4th, then a one-day 
run-up, followed by a narrow movement over to the 10th. From this day on a fairly sharp reaction for 
two days is due. The market should straighten itself out again by a comeback even beyond the 
resistance level, which stopped the advance between March 4th and 10th. However, on this "push-
through'' we should immediately hit another snag by the 17th. We should develop a sidewise movement 
over to the 25th, followed by a small "shake-out" for two days, which is to end by the 27th of March. A 
run-up to the resistance level of the previous ten days should come forth lasting till the 31st   of the 
month. The whole month should represent a further accumulation period, around the 150-153 level of 
Dow Jones. A few days after we have entered the month of April we can look for higher levels. 
This deduction should prove correct, provided we start with an up move between February 20th 
and February 24th. However, let us watch closely whether or not February 20-24 period begins an up 
move. SHOULD THIS PERIOD BECOME A TOP from which we drift downward, then conclude 
without further ado that all dates furnished above for the month of March have to bring forth opposite 
effects so that, what I figure here as tops should become bottoms, and what I figure to become bottoms 
are then due to become tops. Readers who have experience in changing their positions should have no 
difficulty to adjust themselves accordingly. 
 
This is a period just now, which calls for patience. However we have to keep in mind that a 
good sized movement is due to come out of it which ought to last into October and by next month 
enough "chart picture" has developed that I can define more definitely the direction the market should 
take. I believe at this moment that my repeating cycle, which I use, has temporarily changed, so that 
tops in the previous cycle give bottoms in the current one and vice-versa. Next month will prove it. 
Then we either keep it or, if not, we have to revert back to the original cycle. It makes little difference. 
But, mind you, February 20-24 should tell the story. Follow from then accordingly. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
 
Wheat during the month of March 1940 indicates an upward movement for the first five days of 
the month, followed by a reaction to March 21st. From then on a gradual rise should develop into April. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF COTTON: 
The cotton picture has been very strong since mid-December. True, cotton has not been able to 
136
make a new shoot upward, but such strength at high levels makes many people feel as if a new sharp 
upward move will suddenly come to pass. However looking back a year, we note that cotton was selling 
around 7.40, while here it is 350 points higher. The entire up move we may consider as being the arms 
of a person, called "cotton." Then the strength from mid-December on, we shall call the body, which 
lies sidewise at high levels. What is due to happen to cotton after the body is completed? You said it: 
the legs. The legs should be represented in the chart in form of a severe decline that, once started will 
keep on going without interruption until it has reached its goal. A few days may be used up to indicate 
the place of the knee and the knee is halfway down approximately. 
I don't like cotton as a buy. I would have shorts in it and sit still. The one who can sit and wait 
should reap big profits. 
A decline is indicated for cotton from the beginning of March to the 21st, followed by 
stagnation or sidewise to the end of the month. 
Note: The "new" contracts, which came on the Board August 15, 1939, will shortly be 
exclusively traded and "old cotton" will not be traded anymore. 
 
CALL FOR MR DANTE! 
 
Readers who are particularly interested in my article, “Happiness, Health and Money” which 
began on page 73, also those who are following my astrological deductions, should buy two small 
books: The “Vita Nuova” and “The Banquet,” (Il Convito) both of Dante Alighieri. 
 
A hint for you to get into the subject is this: call “the Latin language” heliocentric astrology, the 
“vulgar language” or Italian, geocentric astrology; Greek, call it the combination of helio and geo. 
Italian call Latitude and German call Declination, all these in Geocentric work. 
 
Therefore, speaking of the present war, geocentric latitudes are on the “outs” with geocentric 
declinations.  So, what can we “imps” do about it? 
 
Study these works slowly, no rush to know the end of the story. Unless you know that these are 
astrological works, they are good media to get you to sleep; if you know they are astrological works of 
the finest type, they stir up your thoughts and prove that I am correct in all articles, which I brought so 
far. I myself tackled these two books only recently for actual study.  They had been lying around 
without having been used. 
 
And Dante is a planet and not a person: (See “The Banquet”, book 2, Chapter VII, middle article 
No. 1): “Hear that discourse I hold within my heart”= Watch the retrograde movement that is found 
within my forward movement.   
 
The translator of my copy of Dante’s “Banquet,” London 1889 (translated by Katherine 
Hilliard), on page 117 carries a footnote as follows: "This passage has been thought by many 
commentators to prove Dante's IGNORANCE of Greek; but Fraticelli thinks that, on the one hand, it 
may have been impossible to procure the original in Florence at that date, and, on the other, that Dante 
quotes Homer, whose poetry he says is not translated into Latin." This footnote pertains to the 
following sentence in Dante's Banquet: "What Aristotle said about it we cannot exactly tell, because his 
opinion is not the same in one translation as in the other." 
Poor Mr. Aristotle, planet Venus, it's too bad that you have two sorts of movements in your 
body (opinion=movement), so that your cycles differ, why do the commentators think Mercury would 
not know of that? Mr. Mercury, did you ever run into Venus all these millions of years; I know you 
didn't and they knew it too, but they don't know who you are, nor who Aristotle is, 
In the "Banquet," Book I, Ch. 1 art. 3, we find the following statement of Dante:   "From 
without, in a similar way, we may observe two causes of hindrance, one of which is the promoter of 
many encumbrances, the other of sloth. The first comprises those cares of the family and the state with 
137
which most men are fittingly absorbed, so that SPECULATION is denied them. The other is the fault of 
the place where the person is born and bred, which may be not only void of all learning, but also of all 
studious persons. 
To make sure that people are taken off the right track, Mr. translator had to put his foot into this 
sentence, by adding a footnote, explaining "speculation" for the dear reader thus: speculation means the 
contemplative life. No, Mr. translator; it means just what it says: speculation. Dante means by that 
paragraph: Most people are absorbed with family life, with a job, a position, a business, with politics 
and what not. This all is befitting them though they have little time to devote to speculation i.e. trading 
stocks and commodities in a scientific way. Other people again cannot get the idea for speculation since 
they live out in the sticks, like Bayer does (the latter to finish his research); many people are not born 
and bred for speculation and have not the proper education for such work and, THEY ARE NOT 
STUDIOUS. They rather listen to the radio and to newspaper commentators. 
When you get a hold of this book you will find a very interesting continuation of this idea. 
Further down he says: Oh, blessed are the few that are seated at the table where the bread of the angels 
is eaten; and miserable are they who feed in common with the sheep! 
 This sentence shows, that there have been people that knew all the secrets of motion and that 
due to what they wrote in covered language, later generations can find it again, if they take time and 
effort. The sheep of which he speaks are what we now-a-days call "the lambs" in market language. I am 
trying to get all my clients out of the sheep line and over to the big table where there is lots of place and 
a large seating capacity. A little later he says: They, who are fed at so lofty a table are not without 
COMPASSION towards them whom they see wandering in the pastures of the brutes, and feeding upon 
grass and acorns (trend lines and conjunctions ha ha). 
Up at San Jose, Calif., a law enforcement agent tried to arrest a storekeeper because he had one 
of these pinball machines. The newspaper reported that this man had to spend $34.00 in nickels and 
dimes until he could win 10c, which he went to collect from the storekeeper, since the handing over the 
10c winning constituted the violation of the law. I am using this illustration to show that even 
commentators are at times hitting the explanation right, We find a footnote shortly after the lines 
discussed above, where the commentator says about Dante's works: "Their beauty is in their letter, their 
WORTH in their allegorical meaning. My own saying would be: "Take of all that Mardi Gras stuff 
from all these ancient works and you got the "golden line." Historic events in our sense were not worth 
registering and persons neither. All this history registry started after the year 1500 when they began to 
ape and registered facts about events more or less corrects, while everything previous were facts 
pertaining to the effects of planetary movements, registered under the clock of history.

Relationship between Hebrew Letters 
and Wheat Movements 
by George Bayer 
 
My old Hebrew grammar, published in 1892 says on page two: "The Hebrew alphabet consists 
of twenty-two letters, which represented originally pictures of objects or their framework, whose names 
began with these letters". 
Ginzberg, in his "Legends of the Jews", vol. l, 5 says: "When God was about to create the world 
by his word the twenty-two letters of the alphabet descended from the terrible and august CROWN of 
God whereon they were engraved with a pen of flaming fire". 
Using these two thoughts together the one a plain statement of what the writer of   Hebrew 
grammar had in mind as to the meaning of the alphabet and the other, the religious thought, brought 
forth via legends from the so-called "dark ages", when certain men knew more than we ever shall know, 
I concocted an explanation of my own as to the meaning of the alphabet. It cannot be very well 
explained how I gradually drifted towards these thoughts. Suffice to say, that the results should be 
worth the reader's careful attention. 
We are treating here a very difficult subject---one that includes many various thoughts and 
ideas, which have to be digested. For better understanding, tests should be made on your own part with 
various charts of stocks and on charts of the various commodities covering several years. 
The rules and explanations which follow may be at times a little disconnected anticipating at 
times facts that are explained a little later, or I may be going back to some previous thought in order to 
cover all possibilities for clearer understanding. 
The main idea of this, and of all other articles that will follow from month to month is to impart 
to the reader a clearer conception about the movements in the stock and wheat market their causes and 
effects. None of my articles have anything to do with creed or race, neither with politics. All my work 
is original and solely deduced through the studies of market movements, whereby all other sciences 
have to be entered into facts taken out and incorporated into stock market science. 
Let us inspect for a moment our ancient Hebrew alphabet as shown on Page 5. We note it is not 
the alphabet in current use to write in Hebrew. It is the “old style” Hebrew alphabet. The letters 
resemble more Egyptian hieroglyphics than they do the present Hebrew alphabet. It should not surprise 
us that this is so when we consider for a moment that this ancient Hebrew script must have been used at 
a period that may be close to three or four thousand years ago. The ancients alphabet reveals its true 
meaning, while the Modern Hebrew alphabet has its meaning partly removed. 
The only thing retained in the present Hebrew alphabet is the direction in which the letters are 
written, i.e. instead of writing forward as is done in all modern languages, the letters are written 
backward. But to the keen eye, which gradually has become accustomed to look for hair splitting detail, 
it shows that the originators of these writings covered up something of great importance. 
We shall attempt to put the hidden meanings of the ancient Hebrew alphabet to practical use in 
stock marker operations. 
The Hebrew alphabet starts with 'haleph'' or "alpha" in Greek and ends with "taw, the Greek 
"omega". For our purpose we have to turn the entire alphabet around and start with ''taw', i.e. "omega" 
and proceed the other way so that after "raw" follows "sin", "rash" and "qoph" until we reach "haleph". 
In the Scriptures it says: "I am the alph and the omega, the beginning and the end". It should be read: ''I 
am the taw going as far as haleph, from the beginning to the end. I am one complete cycle. 
 
Here is the law, which I am trying to prove in the present article:  
 
3
ONE CYCLE such as we call IN THE STOCK MARKET a bull movement or a bear movement 
IS REPRESENTED BY THE TWENTY|-TWO LETTERS OF THE ANCIENT HEBREW 
ALPHABET. 
The letters are written backwards, from taw via sin up to haleph as stated above. We now 
attempt to join the letters shown on page5 by writing them tentatively into a bull movement as well as 
into a bear movement on hand of a daily high and low chart. We obtain two scales: let us call them 
"ladders" because they have to incline upwards or downwards in conformity with the trend of a bull 
movement respectively or a bear movement. 
We can see them actually in motion fully alive and moving on the wheat chart given on Pages 6 
and 7. 
A bear trend started for wheat in July 1937 and continued till March 1939. 
The illustration shows the wheat performance from July 1937 to June 1938. The balance of the 
chart from June 1938 to June 1939 will be brought in the June 20th, 1939 issue. 
On the church steeple of a catholic church we find a cross. This is the Hebrew letter Taw, or the 
Greek letter Omega. It is "on top" of the church because that is where it belongs the same as the letter 
taw belongs on top of a bull movement at which place the alphabet begins. When I say of beginning I 
actually mean the end of the alphabet, because letters are written backwards so the beginning is at the 
back, at the 22nd letter. 
Let us trace the letters one by one on hand of the wheat chart and let us see how we fare in 
discovering them, one by one, as they follow in accurate order of the alphabet during the entire 
movement from July 6th, 1937 to May, 1939. 
It must be remembered that occasionally a short movement creeps in, such as the one from 
January 9th over to January 19th, 1938, which seemingly cannot be incorporated into the letter 
belonging to this period. However, we have to consider that in modern writing we do not set each letter 
singly, but join one to the other. The same occasionally have been true with the ancient Hebrew writing. 
In stock or wheat movements when a "new letter" is about to be written into the graph or daily high and 
low chart we need a connection a "hyphen". This idea anticipates somewhat things, which we need later 
on and it is given here so as not to interrupt the drift of thought at the time we reach such cases. 
Our first letter of the ancient Hebrew alphabet is "Taw". In the market i.e. in our wheat chart of 
1937, it represents nothing but the peak day of July 6th 1937:  top of the market. 
The second letter backwards is "sin". It is expressed in the form of a W,  
 
whose lines are all drawn heavy. Any stroke in a letter drawn heavy means: Any stroke in a 
letter drawn heavy means:  big volume should occur at this time. "Sin's" first stroke is from July 5th 
down to July 10th, the up-stroke from July 10 to July 14th, the second down stroke from July 14th to 
July 16th and the last up-stroke from July 16th to July 17th, 1937. 
By this time the letter ''sin'' was completed. Now, when anyone "sins" according to religious 
thoughts, he is apt to go to h... The wheat market, by that time, completed the letter "sin" and just look 
at the chart and see what happened to it. It began to form the letter "resh". The small ring in the letter 
"resh" should mean a "gap", i.e. a small space between the trading range of one day compared to the 
trading range of the next day.  In our actual wheat example it did not make the gap, however, July 20th, 
1937 was a wicked day of decline.  
 
The next letter in the alphabet is "qoth".  It begins July 25th, makes the little head of the ''qoph'' 
over to July 31st; and then followed the stroke down to August 9th. Volume was heavy during this 
down stroke because the letter ''qoph'' this a heavy line down.  
The next letter is "tsadhe". Its movement begins August 12th and ends August 31st, 1937. Here 
4
we have our first case of the "hyphen" mentioned before. It seems impossible to connect ''qoph'' with 
"tsadhe" in one sequence; therefore we had a run-up August 10th and 11th, for two days so as to fit our 
next letter ''tsadhe'' real nicely into the picture.  
The letter "pe" is somewhat harder to find for the inexperienced eye, but just look at the play 
between August 31st, September 8th, down to September 13th. Its shape is triangular: a sharp up and a 
sharp down. It is not rectangular such as the ancient Hebrew ''pe'' is written. In case you had 
commitments in wheat at that time you surely felt as if everything was rectangular. However, aside of 
this, I must state that the letter ''pe" as well as the letters ''lamedh'' and ''gimel'' which we will find later 
do not have to have the very slant as written.  After ''pe'' comes ''hajin".   "Hajin's|" form is an O; the 
only thing that is round in the market is a gap or a day when one single sale is made at one price. In my 
estimation the letter ''hajin'' means end of one phase, beginning of a new phase.  
The letter ''hajin'' represents the low point of September 13th, 1937, the point where ''pe'' ends, 
and ''szamekh'' our next letter starts. The form of 'szamekh'' shows ups and downs; such movements we 
had between September 13th, and September 30th, on fairly light volume since the thin lines of the 
''szamekh'' indicate it.  
Our next letter "nun" was a heart breaker; wheat broke 15c until it completed its engraving on 
the tape. The volume during this decline representing the letter "nun" (none!) was rather small. Most 
traders expected the resumption of the bull movement since we had fallen back to levels, which 
prevailed at end of March and early April 1937 in Winnipeg wheat prices. The thinness of the letter 
strokes of "nun" shows that the 15c had to be lost on small volume. However very few knew that the 
letter "mem" was following the letter "nun". We note that this letter extends from October 14th to 
November 8th, 1937. The end of "nun" was October 13th, 1937 and the two waves belonging to "mem" 
where formed thus: low October 13th, first dome October 16th, next low October 19th, second dome 
October 21st and October 26th, 1937.  
Then followed the wicked stroke down on big volume to November 21st, and 26th, because the 
letter shows heavy shading at the second top from where the sheer drop was supposed to start. Close 
inspection of the original Hebrew letter "mem" reveals that the bends are at the topside of it. This, 
however,  
 
5
does not bring any difficulty since we know the form of “mem”.  Its “tail” is pointed down like 
6
the tail of Scorpio.  The next letter is "lamedh" or the Greek letter lamda. Its Hebrew form is like the 
abbreviation demarking an angle of 45o. This letter, if you had known about it at that time would have 
been worth a mere 26c in wheat's movement because we rose from 1.04 1/4 to 1.18 3/4 by November 
17th, only to lose practically all of it again by Thanksgiving 1937. At that time wheat registered 1.06 
1/2. Next we find the letter "kaph". The length or duration of this letter was from November 25th, 1937 
to January 9th, 1938. Its form is rather weird being similar to our modern letter Y. The tail end contrary 
to what developed with the letter "mem" was not downward, but upward and is shown in the movement 
of wheat from December 31st up to January 9th, 1938. Therefore, let us say: in the letter ''kaph'', some 
sort of a twist develops as it reaches beyond the second half of its form. 
No explanation can be found for the cause of the movement that follows the letter ''kaph'' other 
than its being a "hyphen" to get over to our next letter ''jodh'' I am speaking of the decline which 
occurred between January 9th, 1938 and January 19th, 1938. In itself it was but a movement of 6 1/2c, 
but since we are at analyzing we cannot omit such a swing. 
January 19th, 1938 was the beginning of the letter "jodh". Since its shape and form is an up and 
down, and an up once more, the picture which had to develop in due time had to have a form of a 
modern Z lying sidewise. We find that the first upstroke lasted to February 25th, the down stroke lasted 
from February 25th to March 22nd and the second upstroke till April 8th, 1938. We note in the letter 
proper chat the first upstroke was to be on small volume. The other two strokes were to be on heavy 
volume because these ancient Hebrews purposely made the two other strokes heavy and they knew the 
reason. Close examination of Chicago wheat's performance during this period will reveal that its action 
was not the same but nearly so. Chicago rallied somewhat but we can not very easily decipher our letter 
"jodh" therein. Wheat traders should keep daily high and low charts of Chicago, Winnipeg and even of 
Liverpool, to find the letters. 
Our next letter ''teth'', is produced like an 0 with a dash in the middle. Looking at letter "teth" 
from the distance, it appears to be an "eye" with a big pupil in the center, telling you "watch your step". 
The movement from April 8th, 1938 bowed down a bit to the 12th, and came up for the final run till 
April 20th, 1938 and the ''eye'' was complete. As the most wicked letter of all the twenty|-two I name 
''cheth'' which is our next letter. The Hebrew grammar spoken of in the beginning carries an explanation 
about the letter "cheth" it says: cheth means, "house". I am sure that whenever we form our letter 
''cheth'' in the market a lot of people will go home discouraged. The entire movement is a slow but 
steady decline one day after the other; every time we buy long during this period we get it "in the neck" 
and only he who is short and just plays golf until the "house" is full, i.e. complete, will have big profits. 
''Cheth'' began April 20th and ended May 31st, 1938. 
The next letter "Zajin" began June 1st, 1938. ''Zajin'' is similar to ''jodh'', the only difference is in 
the line that issues in the center which is larger in ''jodh'' and a mere dot in "zajin". These lines also 
have certain meanings and I know their meaning. However, it would lead us too far off at this time to 
delve into this. To satisfy our immediate desire to know what they mean, be it said that it has to do with 
positions of the gaps or with days when sharp breakaway movements are due to begin. The up-stroke of 
''zajin'' leered to June 20th, 1938. The downstroke ended July 27th and the second upstroke ended 
August 4th, 1938. This latter movement was not in proportion to the first up-stroke movement June lst 
to June 20th, 1938 but it is there nevertheless. 
Next in the rhythm of letters is "waw". Its underground meaning might just as well be: "wow", 
as we say to a horse when we want to stop it. The engraving of the letter   "waw'' is similar to a dagger 
and when we compare the movement from August 4th, 1938 down to September, 6th 1938, we have the 
picture of a dagger or a saber, as good as anyone could make.  
It was Mr. Hitler who made this saber during the war scare, rattling it during all that time. 
 
Following "wow" we get the letter "he". Let us pronounce this letter carefully and if repeated a 
7
couple of times you get a word that sounds somewhat like: he-he-he, the e's being short and their tone 
high. Look at the performance of wheat between September 6th and September 28th, 1938 and you will 
recognize the "he-he" or ''ha-ha'' laughs wheat traders got after the "dagger drop" of August. The ''ha-
ha'' was worth a mere 12c, provided you knew your Hebrew alphabet backwards!  
Next letter is "daleth"; in Greek its name is delta. Using either the Greek form in capital letter or 
the Hebrew form, we find the period of October 5th to November 3rd covers this letter and its apex 
occurred on October 21st.   The next letter is ''gimel'' which reminds me very much of people who have 
the ''gimmies', give-me; a lot of the profits pocketed during the moves from July 5th, 1937 apparently 
faded away during the long stretched sidewise jiggling of wheat prices during which time this letter was 
formed. Instead of its picture being sharply down on small volume (entire letter ''gimel'' consists of two 
thin strokes), a thing that was nearly impossible to believe because major bottoms would have been 
broken through that were established back in 1936 and early 1937 on the adjusted wheat charts. 
Therefore, ''gimel'' has to be laid sidewise and not upright when laying out the market performance for 
this period. 
The next letter is "beth". It starts with a line sidewise a sort of a continuation of the sidewise 
lying "gimel". Where ''gimel" ends is not easy to say. It might have been the December 12th top 1938 
or else the January 4th top, 1939. The first stroke of letter "beth" extends to March 17th, the second 
stroke ends May 10th, 1939. 
The last letter of the alphabet is ''haleph''. This letter singular to the letter ''taw'' represents but a 
point. Around this point a complete change of feeling within the traders mind should occur. Crop 
conditions and other things that apparently influent changes in the price of wheat should turn the tide 
from a major decline that began July 6th, 1937, into a reversal of a major bull movement from this 
point on. 
However, our next letter, the 23rd letter should not be "taw " followed by "sin", but the 
movement should be from ''haleph'' via "beth", ''gimel'' and up with the only differentiation that the 
formation of the signs may have to be used just in reverse. By this I mean that "beth" should not be 
written as we have it with a side stroke as base, a line upward with a ring on top, but that the loop 
should be at the base, a sharp up-move following and a sidewise movement around high levels for a 
while so as to complete an inverted "beth". 
The rules given above should not only apply to wheat, but also to stocks and the various 
commodities as well only remember they are moving in different cycle periods. For example, in stocks 
we seem to move forward around the letter " szamekh", coming to ''hajin'' at this period, having 
produced "mem" and "nun" between January and April, 1938. In stocks the partition between "mem" 
and "nun" is shown between March 18th and March 21st, 1939 and the first part of "nun" comprised 
March 21st to March 22nd, the second part, March 22nd to 28th and the third part ended April 11th, 
1939. 
With this example I believe I have shown that some internal connection exists between the 
ancient Hebrew letters and the movements of markets when the daily high and low prices are plotted in 
graph form. Most people who trade stocks or wheat do not keep charts but they are so easy to keep and 
take but a few minutes   each day. When we are to make the entries of the day's performance it becomes 
automatically a part of our daily routine. 
 
There is no material available to check on the numbers used in ancient Hebrew. The numbers, 
no, doubt, should also reveal certain secrets. When we temporarily branch off to our modern way of 
writing and look at our Arabic numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. we immediately are able to connect them with the 
rules explained above.  They seem to represent "gaps", because they have loops such as number 2, 3, 5, 
6, 8, 9 and 0. Only she numbers 1, 4, and 7 fail to contain gaps and indicate only strong down 
8
movements with heavy volume. We note that the numbers 2 and 9 have their "gaps" on top, while 
numbers 5 and 6 have them on the bottom and numbers 3 and 8 have double gaps, the former using half 
a side, the latter full circles, a sort of a "loop-the-loop". Number 0 points to the full circle of 360* 
number 8 shows two sections of 180 each, number 3 form two sections of 90' each. Using this line of 
thought many interesting things may be found about numbers. 
The modern scripts such as we use to day also the German script, the modern Hebrew, even the 
Russian, writing seem to have been derived from this original Ancient Hebrew. At all times we have to 
be aware of the fact that up to a few hundred years or so ago comparatively few people knew how to 
read or write and it was a science by itself to know how to write. The few who did know were either 
scientists or copyists. 
The scientists' aim was to solve the secrets of motion the same as we are trying to solve. The 
secret has been solved in past ages I am sure of that and the Scriptures are proof of it. The hieroglyphics 
of Egypt also contain these secrets, as we shall see later.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Mrs. B. H. Seattle Washington. 
Would switch out of Alaska Juneau and substitute a rail stock. 
Mr. J. N., L. I., N. Y. 
Take a hedge in wheat against your cottonseed oil; hold both long. 
Mr. N. P., Ontario. 
That you failed to take on wheat when suggested does not imply that you sell your lard. It is 
apparently getting ready for the move and should be held into fall. 
Mr. R. T. Bronx N. Y. 
CN should try to get back to 20 within a reasonable time and why not pick also MOPpfd? Yes, 
trade in active stocks only and stay away from unlisted issues. 
Mr. A., Temple Texas. 
In any bull movement whenever indicated, I surely like to have commitments in pfd utilities; 
there are not many to go around and they jump in points and are much in a hurry. 
Mrs. E. B. San Francisco Calif. 
Hides move similar to stocks most of the time; while it costs little to carry a contract, they are 
dynamic movers and it is not what the broker wants now to start a commitment, it is what does he want 
after it when a temporal drop of 100 points occurs? Be careful with hides and have plenty of margin 
even though you are right in the trend. 
SUGGESTIONS: 
Especially during periods of hectic markets many traders avail themselves of Bayer's WEEKLY 
Close Range ANALYSIS of stocks and commodities. 
Its price has been reduced to $12.50 for a three months subscription. Quite frequently, during 
important runs, Bayer's opinion may be desirable so as to know how he feels about the situation from 
week to week. 
For 13 weekly issues, in some periods 14 issues, the cost amounts to but 1-8 point of a hundred 
share lot or l-4c of a contract of wheat.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
Many years of patient research concerning the movements of stocks and commodities have 
passed. No field of science has been overlooked which would give even a mite of information in 
finding laws upon which market movements could be based with any degree of safety. 
 
In the course of time we shall touch upon subjects so foreign to the average trader, so remote 
from the field of normal thought and activity that their relation to the subject could not even be 
suspected. It shall be shown gradually that vast unexplored fields yielding laws upon laws have been 
opened. These laws are not based upon what is commonly termed as astrology, but upon laws that are 
taken exclusively from the Scriptures and allied works. 
 
If you enjoy the reading of my articles, and benefit by the "Preview of Markets", tell your 
friends and traders about it.

PREVIEW OF MARKETS FOR JUNE 1939. 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO. 
 
The tide seems to be just about ready to turn. June should bring the change. The beginning of 
the month is not very favorable for stocks and as we enter the month we should decline and keep on 
declining to the 6th. An attempt of a rally should come up to June 14th, however in the two days 
following that date we can lose what little we made the 8 days previous. Between the16th June, over to 
the 15th, stagnancy should be noticeable together with small "summer" volume when everyone is ready 
to go to the World's Fair at San Francisco. 
These three days, June 16th, to June 19th, 1939 should represent the actual low levels for a long 
time to come. A fairly sharp rally should begin June 19th or 20th, calling for slowly higher levels until 
the end of the month. Small amount of trading activity, possibly the smallest in several years, should be 
witnessed during the month of June 1939. 
There are no trading opportunities during June as far as I can judge, unless you carry a timid 
short position over from May into the first part of June.  However, the main work for traders during this 
month should consist of planning and making commitments in all sorts of stocks on weakness whenever 
weakness comes into the market. I do not believe the 120 level of the Dow Jones will be broken 
anymore; and if it is broken by a point or two it should not cause uneasiness. 
Some great surprises should be in the offing next month (July) to stock traders. I do suggest to 
readers to accumulate a full line of stocks during the middle period of June and stick to it for good sized 
profits. 
WHAT WHEAT SHOULD DO. 
 
It is a somewhat different condition when we talk about wheat. This commodity seems to have 
been liquidated to a standstill during the last eight months. After long sidewise movements an important 
move should begin. In that we had a major bear market in wheat from $1.45 down to .56c, it is not very 
likely that we drop another .56c. Traders speak about excess crop conditions. Anyone who every 
studied "disappearance of cottonseed oil", for example, for which commodity figures are released every 
so often, will find that while during a certain month "disappearance of cottonseed oil" is normal, at 
other months it is so astoundingly large that we gasp. The same way, the wheat surplus should get into 
"disappearance" and nothing will be said anymore. 
Wheat should start its upward movement ahead of stocks; in fact, as we enter the month of June, 
1939, wheat should be moving up already and keep on moving up during the entire month with only 
minor reversals. One of those is indicated for June 14th, the other for June 20th, and their duration 
should each be but two days. 
Therefore, wheat traders should have long lines as we enter the month of June, 1939, and still 
have the same long lines as are leave it. However, as soon as we get into July, wheat should begin to 
make a top. 
WHAT COTTON SHOULD DO. 
 
Cotton shows bullish from June 1st up to June 19th, but it is not in a position to retain that gain 
as far as I can judge, so that after June 19th, we should lose nearly all we have gained on the upside by 
the end of the month. June 30th, however, should prove to become an important bottom for cotton and a 
brand new important upward movement should be inaugurated.

In previous years my works and articles could be obtained only in magazines, which were 
completely disinterested in actual marker movements. Magazines whose editors are orthodox believers 
in economics and "outlook" as factors from which markets could be deducted, would never have 
allowed my articles to reach their public. 
In all articles the law of repeating cycles is stressed and explained as near as we can approach it. 
Everything can be applied in a practical way to your own problems not only in market operations but 
also in your own particular line of business. 
Now that the reception of my first monthly "Preview" for June, 1939 has been satisfactory I 
present to you, this second issue July, 1939, and hope it also meets your complete satisfaction. 
Each one of my readers is requested to help me get additional readers and subscribers by ceiling 
his friends and acquaintances about this publication its purpose and aim. Many traders would be glad to 
get it; if they only knew such a work could be had. Your help in acquainting them will be greatly 
appreciated. 
You know my ability with cyclical work; let me see yours by helping get "Preview" into good 
circulation. 
Some old client when asked for his minion about ways to get "Preview" into quick circulation 
suggested that I each reader to start a chain letter, such as was used successfully by some people in 
Denver a few years ago, telling their friends and traders about my publication, but this, I consider, as 
asking too much of the readers. It is merely mentioned to record this idea.

WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS 
 
From Pecos, Texas a road leads north through the desert for 84 miles to Carlsbad New Mexico. 
After leaving this village there is no house, no farm for about 45 miles; all is desert in its true sense: the 
land is level as far as the eye can see, barren, nothing grows, trees are an unknown quantity, not even 
cactii make their homes in these parts. There is some desert grass, even occasionally single petal pretty 
flowers. 
When we cut across from Carlsbad to El Paso Texas (see map page 17) we also pass through 
desert land but the scenery is somewhat different. We find on this 150 mile stretch to start with washed 
out gravel land, scrub bush, plenty of cacti; further west meadows of spinly grass and a few cows. 
Soon after leaving White City, 20 miles west of Carlsbad, travelers have to pass through many 
richer deep dried out streambeds over which there are no bridges. What interested me about these beds 
were the huge signs at the approach, which announced: "Do not cross when it rains". Imagine rain in the 
desert!  When we went through it end of March, these stream beds were bone-dry so that we wondered 
if there ever was really any water flowing in them. Some 40 miles beyond White city, the first house, a 
gasoline station popped up. Inquiring about the signs yonder, the good man explained that at times 
during the "rainy season" these streams are impassable; they fill up so fast and become very deep so 
that a car would just disappear with the floods. However he explained further, usually they last but half 
an hour or so and the stream is again dry as before. 
What prompts me to write about this desert condition was an article in the papers last winter. It 
dealt with a bar keeper who won the first prize in the sweepstake back in 1930. He had worked in 
London and disappeared after cashing in his winnings. He was an Italian and probably went to 
Mussolini land to enjoy the unexpected flood of money forever. 
 
The story further to explain that this barkeeper came recently back to London, broke, crying to 
get his old job back. It took 8 years to reduce the first prize winnings to zero. 
Aside of the story being interesting, there is actually nothing unusual about it when we apply 
cosmic laws as we shall presently see. 
The man might just as well have been a stock or commodity trader who made a killing in the 
market as happens at times. In our thoughts then, let us imagine constantly that it is a trader we are 
thinking of as we go on into explanations of the phenomena. 
Let us get back to the desert trip! We stopped several times to look over the vast barrel area; we 
examined and ad- mired the single, faded red or pale yellow flower, half starving because they just can't 
exit on a constant diet of undisolved silicium oxide. They felt happy just the same in their surrounding. 
They waved their pretty little heads in the soft desert wind as if   they wanted to say: Get going, and   
don't worry about us! We'll get along all right!                   
Human life is part of Nature. The way we are born is the way we shall be. With "we" I don't 
mean John or Bob or Bill, I mean by "we", Nature, all the flowers, whatever their name, the mosquito, 
the cat, the tree, US steel, lard, wheat, anything that has a beginning. The snapshot of the birth moment 
indicates the way of life. What has begun cannot be altered; it has to take its course. 
The position of the planets at the time the "something" is born will indicate what is due for it; all 
we need to know are the laws that govern "motion". The Scriptures contain these laws covered over 
with paint, with many coats of paint. The writers knew their laws so well that they could devote years 
on the paint job and make no errors. 
 
Planetary positions, as they gradually change, produce upheavals on our earth. They are also 
the cause, which produce hills and dales up and down moves, deserts and streams forests and lakes, 
male and female, and oceans. Normal planetary action begets normal persons normal stock movements, 
normalcy all around. This is why the average is taken as a yardstick to judge. There are comparatively 
18
few who measure above the average; there is a large quantity found below the average. This large 
quantity of people, or of stocks which are found below the average might be compared to the large 
deserts that exist on the various continents of our earth; the Arabian desert, the Sahara and Gobi deserts, 
the vast desert land of Northern Australia, our own desert in the South-west. 
When I chose the title for this article I thought of myself as being in the desert where, when it 
rains it pours. Sometimes it is the same with people. To the barkeeper, a perfectly normal specimen of 
human mankind working day after day on his job earning an honest living fell the lot and he made a 
killing. However, since water in the desert does not stay for any length of time, winnings too, usually 
do not stay very long as many of you have also already experienced. The old, average condition 
prevails once more. Unless, UNLESS, something done immediately to protect it. We should be wise 
and build a dam. The governments, long ago, have discovered this secret for the good of all concerned.  
They build big dams (Boulder Dam) big water reservoirs where they store up Rain i.e..  Money, or in 
biblical, terms: they lock up Mr. Jupiter, which is the Planet that gives us water and money. This 
dammed water is used when and if needed. 
When we read back our first two paragraphs and make the proper substitutions, we obtain the 
ideal normal man. 
There is a normal amount of money in the family; a normal amount of money is earned. There is 
a little enjoyment here and there everything runs normally, but there is contentment and satisfaction just 
the Same. At times, better conditions develop, things begin to look brighter, and the individuals begin 
to say; "From now on things will be different, everything shapes up nicely". However ordinarily these 
conditions are but temporary. The main trend is always very slow even though it may be upwards. 
At very large intervals individuals may get some heavy rains. Big money is then made fast 
compared to the normal income. If such a streak arrives it can't be slopped; it just pours. In such a case 
the individual should pay more attention to erecting his dam so that the water doesn't flow off too fast 
as happened to the Barkeeper. But, as it is with human beings they spend it the way they make it. If it 
comes fast they let it go fast and strange, their brain matter acts in harmony with Nature's will. 
Supposing a bull movement is in full swing. Traders are all long of stocks and accumulate paper 
profits. How can they take care of these paper profits and turn them into cash in due time? There are 
two ways:  
 1) To take profits on sharp run ups and keep the cash until another opportunity presents itself.  
 2) To protect the profits with stop loss orders a reasonable number of points below the then 
prevailing price level. Such stop-loss orders, when once placed with the broker, should never be 
removed or moved downward. In case the movement keeps on going further upward, these stop loss 
orders should be gradually raised higher. As the trend changes and we go into a downtrend or even into 
a bear market, these orders should not be taken out at the moment, as many are prone to do. Let them 
have it!  
 
Do not think the whole market is declining just because "they know" you have 200 shares stopped 
below, and that after "they picked them up" the whole market turns face and runs into a new bull 
marker 200 shares, even 1000 shares count too little when 1 1/2 or 2 million shares are traded in one 
single day. 
The bar-keeper, our winner, must have spent his money like a drunken sailor, as the saving 
goes, until he had it all spent. Traders often act similarly. They buy stocks, and as the marker goes up 
they gain confidence buying more and more until, finally, they make the big commitment right near the 
top hoping "rain" will never end. They are drunk with prosperity. 
A stop loss order is left with the broker to buy or sell your stock at a time it reaches a fixed 
price, which does not compare to the current momentary price at all. It may be from 3 to 10 points 
below the current level, depending upon the type of the stock and upon visible chart resistance levels 
19
that should not be broken. 
 
For some reason or other Nature provides us with deserts, also with oceans along with this it 
provides fertile land. In comparing human beings to fertile land we must take the rich not only in 
money, but in health, in intelligence, in power, in friends etc.; the same as we have many kinds of soil 
fitted to grow the various food products. Nature also has its oceans. But when looking for similarities 
among human beings we do not fare so well unless we class among the group covering oceans the 
multi-millionaires, the celebrities whose names are known all over the world such as Mahatma Gandhi, 
Charley Chaplin and especially people who are used in caricatures. When once newsreel photographers 
are after you consider yourself very close to becoming a celebrity, even though only a temporary one. 
When the stock market moved in dizzy heights back in 1929 it also was a celebrity for a while. 
 
Since our field of explanation in this article lies down around Carlsbad, New Mexico, we might 
just as well tackle another phenomenon that I found at the big Caverns of Carlsbad. The beauty and size 
of these caverns is unsurpassed though out the world. Magnificent is no word. They must be seen. Jim 
White also must be seen. I looked at him and watched his every movement for about half an hour. He 
was so interesting! Who is Jim White? A celebrity, from my point of view. He is but a little cowboy, 
roaming the hills of the Guadelupe Mountains in the neighborhood of White City, New Mexico. This 
latter place was apparently named after him although the city can boast of but a restaurant and some 
cabins for tourists, it is nevertheless called a city just to spite New York. 
 
One day Jim White discovered a hole on the mountain near the top, which led down into the 
earth. He slid down with ropes to see what was in it. The next day he went down again and stayed three 
days exploring it. This hole is now known as the Carlsbad Caverns a National   Monument. He told his 
fellow cowboys all about what he had found its grandeur and vastness its formations but they just called 
him the "crazy cavern" or something of the sort and took no further interest in his discovery. Jim went 
to Carlsbad to spread the news about the Caverns. Then everyone said:   "That's interesting", "that’s 
nice", but that was all. He offered people to take them without cost to just show them what he found. 
Nothing doing; they wouldn't go on any fool's errand. The Caverns were all his. Sometime later he 
found another hole next to the big one out of which he saw, every evening, millions of bats emerging to 
feed. He investigated this new discovery. For thousands of years millions of bats must have lived there 
because he found dung from 30 to 100 feet deep. Going back to Carlsbad he offered to show the people 
the bats.  
 
They did not care to see bats either. Caverns and bats were taboo. Finally he found a man, a 
dealer in fertilizers, who wanted to ''1ook''.  His business sense told him than bat manure may be 
profitable to sell if obtained for nothing. Tim White, happy as a lark, had found his first visitor. After 
inspection of the bat manure deposits the fertilizer man financed its excavations, using Tim as foreman 
of the "mine". Notwithstanding the fact that this fertilizer-man was around the Caverns   for years, he 
refused to even think of interesting himself to look over the wonderful caverns. He never saw them.

Jim White never gave up trying to convince somebody, whoever he might turn out to be, to just 
come, please, look and see for yourself my beautiful caverns: Patience and insistence even though it 
took him nearby 25 years to achieve it brought results. He found occasionally some tourists who dained 
to look them over if it wouldn't cost too much. But Jim was reasonable. One day a fellow who, as Jim 
explained looked like a stockbroker, rich and wealthy, wanted to see the caverns. On the way over the 
23
hills Jim "made a touch" suggesting that he buys this land for a few hundred dollars, build some sort of 
approach and show the caverns to the world at large. Nothing came of that. But, they were worth 
something and Jim knew it. Finally the talk about these caverns came around to Washington and the 
result was that today the Caverns are a National Monument with daily summer visitors amounting to 
between 4 and 5 thousand people. Jim's faith in his discovery was crowned with success. 
He now runs the restaurant one thousand feet below the entrance near one of the large 
underground halls so vast that the Capitol Building at Washington would fit nicely into it even allowing 
space for the grounds. He sells a book containing his life story. Most visitors come up from the Caverns 
with one of them, and 75c is not too much for what he has written in it. It's raining in the desert for him 
and it most assuredly will stay that way for him. He deserved it!  
Let us turn this example into market operations, especially into commodity markets of the 
present time! Commodities such as lard, cottonseed, oil, cocoa and sugar have been in the dumps for 2 
1/2 years. They have been declining continuously. After darkness comes daylight. Patient accumulation 
of commodities at this period, especially the ones mentioned should bring big profits. Lard at 16c at the 
end of 1936 and 6 1/2c in June 1939 has lost all the "water" it contained. It has to "rain" again and swell 
up the price of lard as well as of other commodities even of grains.  When it does begin, the advance 
will last some time. Anyone short of these commodities since early 1937 would have to cover now and 
reverse, but who had that much nerve? This statement of holding positions for long times does not 
imply that in between movements should be utterly ignored. Trading commitments should be in one 
direction only when the board cannot be watched closely. In a bear market it is poor policy, as far is my 
experience has shown to go long for rallies and leave the market unattended for several days; while 
shorts may be covered on weakness temporarily, they should be put out again on sharp rallies that never 
fail to come into bear swings. The same way in a bull movement, short selling at such periods is often 
disastrous. The procedure should be to sell out on fast run-ups when big volume occurs and buy back 
on weakness. Should weakness not develop but important resistance points be crossed on the upside 
long positions must be resumed immediately So as to remain in the trend. For this reason it is so 
important to keep charts of the daily performance of the commodity one actually trades. 
 
SPACE FILLERS . . . .
In analyzing the statement clipped from a news paper of May 26th, 1939, from the heading "HIGH 
LIGHTS", I tried to get the drift of the story because Chrysler stock is one of my pets, and since this 
special report was found next to the stock quotations it apparently was meant for traders to decide from 
it whether stock should be held, sold or added to from here on. Three times I went over it; now you try 
and see what you can make of it! See ill. 3, page 17 
 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THE REST OF THE YEAR? 
Note: The forecast in chart form for stocks for wheat or for cotton for the second half of the year 1939, 
giving you a broad view of the way the market should develop for the balance of the year is still 
available and may be had for $12.50. The outcome of the next election, is pretty well discernible from 
the stock forecast, at least Bayer thinks so. Would it help your business? If so, get them. 
 
PREVIEW FOR JULY 1939. 
 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO: 
24
 
The uninteresting market in stocks during June 1939 has about run its course. Such narrow movements 
when not even a tape trader can catch two points in a week are usually the forerunners of big events. 
The month of July 1939 should become one of the "star" months that are not witnessed very often. It is 
hard to visualize that we should get a movement this month that has hardly any kink in it. Not since the 
big move from July 12th, 1932, up to August 15th, 1932 did this happen. However things do repeat 
once in a while and it is only up to us to find when this should occur again. There is actually nothing 
more to be said except that a steady uninterrupted upward movement is indicated for stocks all of July. I 
would have no shorts in such a market and if one intends to pyramid, mid-July would be a good time to 
add to positions as far as my work indicates. 
 
WHAT WHEAT SHOULD DO: 
 
Wheat should have completed its big movement the very day we enter into the month of July. A period 
of distribution is indicated for wheat during the month.  A reaction should start from the first of July; 
that day should become the high day for the year, unless, after going through a reaction to the 6th of the 
month, the ensuing rally brings the high on the 8th of the month. Remember, July lst as well as July 7-
8th, are always important days for wheat. You could pick 4 out of 5 in recent years that brought 
important turns of trend on those dates. A little bigger reaction should begin from July 8th, lasting until 
July 17-18, when small trading rallies that should miss the previous tops are indicated but end rather 
suddenly. The month should close at or near the lows of the month. Crop news after the early July 
government report, should be interpreted as slightly bearish by the public and readers who are wheat 
growers would do well, as far as I can judge to dispose of their crop or take hedges against it when the 
government report is ready to be released. 
Therefore wheat should get into a trading market as we enter July with gradually lower levels in view. 
 
WHAT COTTON SHOULD DO: 
 
Cotton's picture comes rather near to the wheat picture this month. While sharp run-up is indicated the 
first four days of July, the price approach to the June high would become a signal for a top, especially 
so if the volume starts ''to peter out" after the initial spurt to July 4th. A gradual sagging tendency for 
the balance of the month is indicated at least till the 28th of July. That day should find us around the 
lows of the month with higher prices indicated for August, in fact new highs should be produced. July 
17th or 18th would be a time to buy cotton back, and the rest of what you intend to carry would pick up 
between July 25th and 28th on weakness. Cotton points more bullish than grains. 
Other commodities. Due to the time it takes to analyze the many other commodities some 
distance in advance, they are not given. Sixteen of them are treated in the weekly analysis; they all 
move individually by themselves in their own cycles and must be individually judged.

HOW TO BUILD A TRADING PYRAMID 
When markets are active and moving in one direction, upward in a major up move or downward 
in a bear market, many traders are in doubt how to operate at such times.  We want to get the best out 
of trading without jeopardizing safety. We are talking about margin trading and not so much about 
outright buying. A pyramid as we commonly understand it is one of those rock piles in the Egyptian 
desert erected some 4000 years ago for a purpose apparently unknown to us. 
In mathematics a pyramid is a polyeder limited by a polygon and of as many triangles as the 
polygon has sides. When we construct a polygon Fig. ABCDEF and take outside of the plane of the 
polygon point S. From the corner points A, B, C, D, E F of the polygon we draw straight lines toward 
the point S, and lay planes between each of two adjoining lines. Such construction produces a body, 
called a pyramid. 
 We build a trading pyramid when operating in markets upon long stretched sidewise movements at 
low levels. One of these long sidewise movements illustrated in our wheat chart page 17 between 
September 1938 and April 1939. 
The base of the pyramid is the longest area in number of days that have to pass on the chart. As 
we go higher, step by step towards the peak (S of our pyramid illustration), the top of the major 
movement, the planes parallel to the base plane, become smaller and smaller in area, until we reach a 
plane which in itself is but the end point, the top. 
Let us assume the market is in a major uptrend. Most of the buying should be done at or near the 
lowest plane at the base. Stocks and commodities are prone to make big bases before they start a bull 
move. Look at wheat from September 1938 to April 1939, Sugar, from Oct. 1938 to March 1939, 
Cocoa, this Spring, Silk, last summer and fall; Stocks, June and July 1932, also from October 1932 to 
April 1933, etc. As we come into higher regions a pyramid can be started, additional purchases can be 
made at higher levels of course but in lesser quantities. As markets move still higher we still add to 
commitments on weakness when such weakness develops, but reducing the amount once more and so 
on up till we near the peak. 
As an illustration we take U.S. Steel such as it performed during the last few years. 
U.S. Steel around 40, normally forms big bases (except in extreme bear cycles). Thus a pyramid 
can be started whenever U. S. Steel reaches around the 40 level. Let us say a trader can buy 500 shares 
of stock around this level, intending to pyramid as the time becomes propitious. Charts of the daily 
performance of steel for several years back are necessary to judge right. Whenever an important level is 
crossed, the stock can be pyramided on weakness following such crossing; let U.S. Steel cross 52 1/2, 
an important resistance point. On weakness after such crossing this trader should add 300 shares more 
67 1/2 is another important point. When this level is crossed some more stock should be bought with 
parts of the accrued profits say 200 shares. When the 90 level is crossed, one more attempt may be 
made to add say 100 shares. But, when we know that the average top level in normal movements for 
steel is a little above 100 and not 262, we cannot possibly add more without endangering our pyramid. 
The higher we get in price, the nearer we get to the top of the pyramid and the bigger the reactions that 
ensue. 
Pyramids should be made in sizable distances and not a point or two apart. It would be wrong to buy 
100 shares of Steel say at 40, 100 at 41, 100 at 42, etc.  It would be worse yet to buy U.S. Steel when a 
big base has been made the following way: Say the base point is around 40 and one would enter orders, 
100 at 40, 100 at 39, 100 at 38, etc. He may get none whatever but will be glad to pay 52 for the entire 
intended lot. 
 
When the market is a buy it is a buy "at the market", and not at a stipulated price, especially 
when "chiselers" see a stock sell at 40 1/8 for two hours on big volume and they dare to enter an order 
26
at 40 or even at 39 7/8. Usually, if it does go there under conditions explained above then the stock is a 
sale and not even a buy. 
As we approach the end of an upward move, the selling period must be carefully analyzed. U.S. 
Steel crossing 100 in our assumed example would start the beginning of unloading to people who begin 
to buy at high levels, figuring that the stock now goes to 200. The first amount bought, i.e. the 500 at 
the low base could be dropped first, and as we go higher, every 4 or 5 points the next lowest bought lot 
should be sold out until nothing is left from the buying period. Immediately thereafter, without much 
delay short selling should begin. This matter of short selling has a lot of traders baffled. They don't dare 
to sell short. However, we realize that after a rise there must be a decline again. Nature changes the 
minds of people from "wanting" into "not wanting" stocks. Short selling is but anticipating lower levels. 
Because an immense lot of people see only roses blooming, they invariably buy with their accumulated 
funds, stocks at high levels. In fact they act so anxious to get stuck that they buy at "your price". Let 
theme buy stocks from you at or near the top even though you have to go out and borrow stock, 
especially so when you are fairly sure in your judgment that prices have to recede and that the big bulls 
who usually buy a stock like U.S. Steel above 100 get discouraged later on and you buy that stock at 30 
to 50% rebate or even less from them and turn it over to the man you borrowed it from. Those who loan 
stocks are usually big investment trusts or estates who hold stocks through bull and bear markets for 
dividends or for some other reason. Whoever lends the stock does not matter, but what matters is that 
you sell it to those who want stocks at high levels without even having these stocks yourself and when 
their price has receded sufficiently you buy them back from the discouraged bulls at "your price", 
turning them back to the owner, The difference in price is your profit. 
After all long stocks are disposed, a pyramid should be started for the decline; so that you 
should sell short in certain definite ways that usually turn out profitable. 
The biggest lot in the original short sale should be sold first. Say you sell 500 U.S. Steel around 
110.  Sell the next lot of 300 shares short about 10 points later, whether it is 10 points above the original 
sale or 10 points below it. The next lot of 200 shares another 10 points beyond this above or below, so 
that the full short line is out within about 30 points. As we reach the lows of a decline again we cover 
these shorts and buy long in the same manner as we proceeded on the top, only reversing the action. 
Intermediate swing traders can do the very same way when using the swings that are about the 
size of an ellipse (see my work "Time Factors''), however more discrimination has to be applied 
pertaining to gaps and it is a good rule in this type of trading to make the various purchases or short 
sales whenever a gap is made. The proportionate buying and selling should be maintained. 
A smaller trader can avail himself of the same mode of trading when using an amount of 50, 30, 
20, 10 shares, or other proportionate amounts to suit his fund. 
Such procedure precludes first of all "over trading", the worst weakness traders have. Secondly, 
it precludes ''plunging'', or what I call "being carried away with enthusiasm". It is folly to suddenly buy 
a 500 share lot of stock because you overheard an "insider" talk about this and that stock going to 130 
for sure….. Giving ear to all sorts of talk does influence traders tremendously. One case I heard of 
myself when a trader explained to me that he bought a certain stock at high levels because his uncle had 
a friend whose 2nd cousin was a runner or doorman at a big investment house and that fellow told this 
second cousin that he heard of some big man buying this stock at current levels........ So he bought that 
stock too. 
Pyramiding requires the biggest risk at the beginning of a cycle, either close to an important low 
or close to an important peak. This is when the biggest commitment must be risked. All others do not 
entail any risk whatever, as far as I can discern unless the procedure is undertaken in a different way as 
explained above. After the first commitment you play practically with the profits. It takes patience and 
time, but big profits can be made that way. 
 Of course, there are traders whose blood runs different. They are in the market for the 
27
excitement they derive from it. They should adopt these rules for the intermediate swings and should 
fare well. 
At the present period a pyramid may be started in stocks. 
 
MAKING GRAPHS FROM STOCKS AND COMMODITIES 
 
A graph or chart of a stock or a commodity should be neatly kept and be legible. The most 
suitable paper is the K.&E. paper, such as is used in the forecast tracing. I marked off a square in the 
stock forcast, see page 17. This square is the unit of plotting. For low and medium priced stocks selling 
up to about 12 dollars, one such square should represent $50 or 1/2 point in its movement (fluctuation). 
All other stocks, should be plotted one full point or dollar to the square, making the small lines in 
between the quarter points and leaving place to plot also the eights within these small lines. 
For commodities we have to make special adjustments so as to keep the price structure in 
certain proportions to lay ellipses. 
For wheat and all other grains, whether Chicago or Winnipeg, use 1c for one square or 1/4c for 
each small thin line. 
Therefore, each square represents fluctuation of $50.00 per contract unit. 
Cotton takes 10 points per square in the chart; Hides 12 1/2 points; Cottonseed oil 8 1/3 points 
per square, so that every third square you have an even number. Copper 9 points; Butter 1/4c; Coffee 15 
points per $50 fluctuation; Eggs 3/8c per square; Cocoa 17 points; Lard 10 points; Rubber 22 points. In 
Silk 4 points represents a $50 movement; Sugar 4 1/2 points (for simplicity take 4 points); Wool tops, 
one square for a single cents movement. Wool tops are always quoted in tenths of a cent thus 10/10c is 
one square. 
The charts suggested are dated on top and bottoms margin so that it is easy to plot the daily high 
and low prices on the right line. Each day of the year is contained, even the 29th of February in case we 
strike a leap year. It necessitates the omission of Sundays and holidays which spaces simply remain 
vacant. 
Readers inexperienced in drawing should first make their entries with pencil by plotting the high 
and the low price of the day with a dot and then connecting these dots with a line. Later on use a hard 
pen to draw the lines. 
Commodities must be plotted in one option as long as possible, usually until about one month 
before expiration of the option. As we get nearer to the expiration date buying by actual consumers 
comes in which apparently throws the price structure out of its equilibrium, as inspection of any chart 
will show that is kept up to the last day an option is traded. Therefore we have to "switch out" of an 
option and go into a later one usually one that has still some six months to run. From September option, 
which should be abandoned for plotting purposes about mid-August, switch into March or May options. 
The switching must take care of the price differential that exists between the plotted option and the one 
that is to be plotted from that time. On the day you change an option, you proceed as follows (as 
example use August 15th). Supposing September Wheat is selling between 81 1/2 and 82 1/4 while on 
the same day May wheat of the year following is traded between 76 3/8 and 77 1/2, then you make a 
new scale by calling the old 81-82c level from now on 76-77c level and keep on plotting the new option 
as if nothing ever had happened, ignoring completely the values of the September option.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
There are eras in existence in our world. One of them was in existence when the Bible, the 
greatest astrological work was written. At that time some people knew all the laws governing you and 
me, the markets and the life of anything, when they had to be born, when they had to die. There were no 
''shoulds nor woulds". They knew also that according to their laws the knowledge of these laws was to 
disappear again and some makeshift ideas were to take their place. This was the reason why they wrote 
the Bible. They wrote it in words that dared thousands or serious students to solve the meaning. In one 
of the Midrash it says: "If after five years of work you have not made any great progress with your 
studies, give up". I came across this passage just about five years after I had begun to really and truly 
devote practically all my time towards the study of Sacred Literature. This was around June 1st, 1939. 
At that time I asked myself candidly: How far did the five years of study bring you? The answer was: A 
few thousand pages of notes were produced, some five thousand index cards were marked with 
explanations as to what the individual words "might mean". Every corner and nook of the house has 
Bibles or other related books lying around. Whenever I got stuck in one book, I started all over with 
another, until by June 28, 1939 I was so thoroughly disgusted with the books that I just stared into 
space, saying: "George, what a fool you were, trying to solve something that cannot be solved." But, 
similar expressions I had used on myself already several times. 
Around 6:30 p.m. on June 29th, 1939, right after dinner, I decided to start for the 101st or l25th 
time, whichever time it might have been, just once more, the very last time, with Genesis 1, I and see if 
I could not find a cue as to time.. I jumped quickly over to the generations of Adam, because in them, I 
knew, had to be the timing. Once, I would know what is a year, the "beginning" was made. 
I drew on a sheet the ages of the various men quoted and by 6:45 p.m. JUNE 29th, 1939 - I 
FOUND THE TIMING, pure and simple, so astonishingly true, that I had to stop for ten minutes to get 
over the spell that gripped me right there and then. 
This point is the beginning of a NEW ERA. You shall see that it is so. Since that moment I have just 
taken enough time to rest. I have reached already Jacob as he sleeps under the heavenly ladder on the 
earth. This ladder reached to heaven (Genesis 28). 
Every word up to that point is absolutely clear to me as to its meaning and what follows will be 
clear to me within the next two months at the outside. I have, of course, subjected certain parts to tests 
already and, boys, it is grand, the Grandest thing that could be found. We all shall benefit of it real 
soon, so have just a little more patience!  
Here are a few high lights of the find:    
1. The Bible is the book explaining the effects of planets. 
2. The effect can never be obtained with what is commonly known as astrology. 
3. The names quoted in the Bible can be angles or points of conjunctions. 
4. The meaning can only be discovered by discarding completely everything that 
is shown in astrology books, excepting the names of the planets. 
5. He who is well versed in ordinary astrology and who begins to devote his full time, some 14 
hours a day, for fully five years may, if he is fortunate, his the spot to know: what is ONE YEAR that is 
always quoted in the Bible. Then he can start to build the house which does not take long to do after 
that, because by that time he has gone through the Bible a hundred times "a-hunting".    
6. The hieroglyphics of Egypt, the Mohammedan Koran, the Jewish Scriptures, the Christian 
Scriptures are all one and the same:  works that explain the effects of planets to later generations. 
 
7. Every word of the Bible is absolutely true and in its right place; it contains not one unnecessary 
30
word.

HOW CAN A TRADER STAY IN BUSINESS 
 
31
 I recall that a medium sized delicatessen store on Broadway in Long Island City, N. Y., 
changed hands several times. The price involved in the transaction was each time between $7500.00 
and $8,500.00. The stock of goods went with the deal, so did the five year lease that covered the "right" 
to be at that place under a stipulated rental which was about $100.00 per month. The new buyer each 
time had to put up in cash between $3,000.00 and $3,500.00, the balance in notes at so much a month 
until fully paid. 
The little stationery store next to it also changed hands twice in three years. The change 
involved each time $3,000.00. The cash needed to buy that place amounted to $1000.00 and the balance 
to be paid monthly until paid in full. 
Now, what did these people buy who acquired these stores? They bought a permit to operate a 
store, from the owner of the property for which they pay monthly $100.00, business or no business. 
They sought the location of the place, a fairly thickly populated section where three other delicatessen 
stores are within two blocks and four stationery stores are offering the same ware. They bought the 
"unknown quantity," the customers who are expected to buy their goods. They also bought the troubles 
that were left behind by the former owners, such as dissatisfied customers wear and tear of fixtures by 
the former owner, they bought expenses of remodeling, redecorating, renewing the store to suit their 
own taste which, as I understood cost the delicatessen men some $1,500.00 with-in three weeks. They 
bought the merchandise as is, salable and unsalable, some that might have been stocked three years ago 
by some other owner who bought it with the idea of selling it again, but since it turned out to be 
merchandise that may sell at some other place, it seems it could be sold in this place. 
The new owner had to buy additional goods from wholesalers to stock up and replenish the 
store. Thus, when we add up the expense a fellow incurs to get a store of the kind described   into 
operation, it amounts in round figures to about $5,000.00 and a debt to start with of about another 
$5,000.00. The first $5,000.00 he must have in cash else he can't start the store; the second $5,000.00 
must come out of profits. 
Everybody knows that the average delicatessen or grocery store works with a brut profit of 25%. 
After deducting rent expenses light, helps and miscellaneous, such as paper bags, he may clear 10% net, 
out of which his salary and living costs must come forth, his payments on the mortgage plus the interest 
and other incidentals not mentioned of which there are quite a few, small in single items but 
aggregating as a whole. 
He opens the store at 7 a.m. and closes at midnight. Time is no object. During hours when 
customers are scarce, he might go to his home and take a nap to be freshened up for the rest of the day. 
During all these years that I lived in that neighborhood it very seldom happened that I passed that store 
and did not see these store-keepers in their stores whatever hour it might have been; they are constantly 
on the job. 
Why are these people so much at the job? First to make money, secondly to protect the money, 
which they have invested in the store. The result of such work is a fairly steady income, which depends 
of course, upon the neighborhood and upon the individuals that patronize this store and not one of the 
three stores nearby. Courtesy to anyone who buys something, however small the purchase might be, is 
of prime importance. Price, as low as consistent with quality, is another important factor. If the house 
wife can get a package of washing soda a block away for 11c she surely is not going to pay 12c to that 
other store because of the good looks of the man. She wants to save that lc and rightly so. Whether the 
man bought it per case for 10c or for 9c or for 3c does not interest her. She is out to get a certain brand 
at the lowest possible price. Here at Carmel I noticed our own grocer charging for a can of coffee 33c 
and some time ago made a special of same, for 30c, while in all other stores the price is 29c. Upon 
inquiry he told me he cannot buy as much as the big chain stores and consequently has to pay more for 
it and thus cannot afford to sell it cheaper; result, the coffee stays on the shelf, and people go 
somewhere else to buy their coffee and many other things that otherwise would have been bought from 
32
him. 
The next factor a storekeeper has to watch is cleanliness, the display of goods to attract the eye 
of the purchaser towards his merchandise. This is an expense that costs work and material he also has to 
be a good conversationalist, besides being a good listener to all sorts of gabbing and gossiping about 
events in the neighborhood. He must know who wants to hear news and who doesn't. He must know 
about children and listen carefully when mothers explain to him about the vitamins A and B and C and 
D. 
He lives in a world of his own as small as it may be, covering but 1 1/2 or 2 city blocks. He has 
to consider himself being the Sun and the customers rotate around his store, affecting him sometimes 
and not affecting him at other times (not buying). 
As the time comes around that he doesn't care for the store any more, which includes location, 
customers amount of sales done, profits or losses accumulated he takes an agent who offers the place to 
someone else and another "king" enters to rule the store to take profit and loss and all that goes with it. 
Let us apply the thoughts and laws contained in the above case and apply them to market traders. 
The greatest fallacy in a market trader is his idea to get rich quick. As it is with a grocery man 
who has to open once his first store, so a trader has to open once an account. The grocery man however, 
opens his store or buys his store with the idea to make a living and normal profits, while a trader who 
opens his account usually does so on account of:  
1. Hearing from other people how much profits they made in this or that stock, and he tries to do 
the same. 
2. Making some side-money apart from the regular business. 
3. Going into business of trading the same as a man goes into the grocery business. 
4. Some inheritance arrived which is of abnormal size compared to what he is used to. 
5. The gambling spirit gets a hold of the man. 
On item No. 1 we just have to frequent brokers offices and listen for five minutes to traders. 
You hear all about their profits but you never hear a sound about their losses. They take for granted that 
you are not interested in losses else you would not be at that place where apparently "all is profits". He 
may tell jokes and at the very same time swear inwardly about his stock having gone off another quarter 
just now on the tape and he will not tell you that his paper loss is already seven points; he will not even 
tell which stocks he is "hooked" with, but persistently explain how he did make those two points a year 
ago and how he outwitted the smart Alecks, although after he took his profit --those two points-- that 
stock went another 12 points but he will say: "You never get poor taking a profit......" 
About item No. 2:  A store that takes in a sideline admits without stating so that his own income 
is not enough and has to take recourse to some outside item to save the business. People who trade 
stocks or commodities as a sideline are not trying for pin money although they may tell you so. They 
are trying for bigger money than their business brings in. However, trading stocks or commodities is 
different than selling a pound of meat or a can of sardines. In the latter case you are satisfied with a 2c 
profit, but in stocks or commodities one tick on the tape may represent the whole day's receipts of the 
store. When one is used to measuring in cents he is unable to measure in dollars, but strange as it may 
sound, he who can figure in dollars can do so in cents because it is easy to go down the ladder but very 
difficult to go up on it. In this instance I am not referring to the traders who are trying for swings, but of 
traders who try to catch a point here on the upside and another point the day after. 
Item No. 3:  The trader who opens an account the same way as a Grocer buys a store.  
This man usually takes an amount of say between $3000.00 to $10,000.00. He might have been 
watching markets for quite some time, so as to get acquainted with his merchandise. He knows that his 
merchandise is for selling purposes. Before he sells he has to buy (unless it is a short sale). In order to 
sell with a profit he has to buy lower than where he sells it. He knows that grocers also have 
merchandise that is unsalable for a long time because nobody wants it. When a stock does not act good 
33
or does not move within a reasonable time with the others he knows there is something wrong with it, 
and if something is wrong and the grocer does not know the reason, he will try to eliminate that article 
as fast as he can, even at a loss. The same a trader should do. A trader of that type tries to earn as much 
as he can learn about his "goods." He will try to detect what makes these up and down moves. He soon 
will realize that the secret is not buried in the corporation whose stock he trades but somewhere else. He 
knows that the number of shares off a corporation is usually the same, whether they sell for $8.00 or 
$108.00. The goods made by the corporation also remain the same; as a rule, the factories and real 
estate properties change very little too. Just the same, at one period the stock is worth 8 and at some 
other period 108. He also knows pretty soon that a stock is not always cheap because it sells at 8 and it 
is not always high priced if it sells at 108. Al1 these values are relative, belonging to the momentary 
time cycle. 
Item No.4:  Inheritance or some other source of funds that seek profitable employment. In this 
instance the unexpected fund is a cause of great worry. As a rule, the heir never thinks of: How can I 
make sure it does not flow away; what he thinks is: How can I double, treble, quadruple this money in a 
month or two months? I am speaking, in this case of people who have had a pretty tough struggling all 
along. In their hurry and rush they usually buy a "white eleplant" whether in stocks or in real estate or 
in some other enterprise. They lack experience to handle money. They can handle $30 and $35 a week 
marvelously, but anything beyond $1000.00 seems to go into the wrong channels for lack of practical 
knowledge. This reminds me of exceptions. The little corporal, Hitler, who commanded a handful of 
soldiers in the World War, is now able to handle 80 millions of Germans; so did Napoleon with nearly 
all of Europe. 
Money acquired step by step, climbing gradually is the best type. Something sudden is martial 
(depending upon the planet Mars). In New York we can see this phenomenon with the Jewish 
population. The poorest type lives on the lower East Side; when conditions become better they move to 
the Bronx; when still better, they shift to Washington Heights, later on down to Riverside Drive and 
finally they land at Park Avenue. You won't find them moving from the Lower East Side straight over 
to Park Avenue. If they do, they are out of place.   
 Item No. 5:  The outright gamblers. There is a trait in human beings, which we may term as 
incurable; gambling. Not everybody is subject to this weakness. Some drink, some loaf, others have 
other vices and some gamble. Poker, dice, horses and stock market, etc. are used by them. They figure, 
in that the market can only go two ways, either up or down, they have a 50-50 chance to win. But, as 
tests have proved, it is not so. The chances to be right "blindly" can occur only when the main rule of 
speculation is observed; buy when everybody thinks we can't go up, and sell when everybody believes   
we are entering a sustained period of prosperity and that idea goes as far as being enlarged in 
newspaper headlines. Strange as it may sound these people only get the idea of a sustained period of 
prosperity when we have been wading through prosperity for quite some time, which they did not even 
realize. 
A gambler goes to the Board Room in the morning, sees a stock strong, it looks good to him, 
and he jumps in. Not with a hundred shares is he satisfied; he takes right away all his account can stand. 
Quite often he gets away with “murder” and makes three points that day and calls it "luck" which it 
actually is. The conservative trader may have bought that stock three months ago and have been sitting 
patiently with it to see it move up three points and, because he is conservative, he gets out when the 
gambler jumps in who takes it over. Both may make three points; one in three months, the other in one 
day. However, he who made it in three months is much better off as far as I can judge than the one who 
makes it over night. The former did honest work and earned a normal profit while the latter just 
gambled. 
At periods it happens that markets run against you. The normal trader knows it. He is prepared 
for it. He does not over trade and has enough reserves to keep him above water so that he does not have 
34
to sell. Unless the situation changes completely, he will not have to take a loss. It is quite different with 
the trader who takes too much of risk. Supposing we look back to the wheat situation of 1924, when 
wheat rose from $1.00 to $2.08 in one year. The fluctuations were sizable. A rise of 25 points; was 
followed by a drop of 20c; and a renewed rise of 30c; followed by a drop of 25c; within a month or six 
weeks period. Supposing you felt the main trend was upward in wheat at that time and you bought as 
the trend started upward, nevertheless you had to have substantial margin to withstand shocks of 20-
25c. At the present period, when wheat fluctuates in a 10c range and good many got themselves into 
trouble because first of all they would not buy at or near a low but persistently waited until a 10c up 
move had occurred and then bought wheat for the next 10c up move. Such an up move should still 
develop, because wheat is not worth 60c normally but its normal price is around $1.00. So where can a 
fellow be wrong when he buys wheat between 50 and 80c if within a reasonable time it can be sold for 
close to a dollar? But, a contract of wheat cannot be handled with $500.00 margin in such a case. He 
may have to use $1,000.00 for it to make sure he is within the safety zone. A grocer uses $8000.00 to 
buy a store and has to wait for customers. A trader who buys eight contracts of wheat in the 65-70 level 
where it was hanging around for eight months (Chicago) from October 1938 to April 1939 might have 
used $8000.00. 
Each lc movement on eight contracts amounts to $400.00 A 10c movement would represent 
$4000.00 therefore, or a capital appreciation of 50 %. How long do you think it would take the grocer 
to make $4000.00 with his $8000.00 store investment? How many hours does he have to spend in the 
store, how many customers does he have to wait on to produce $4000.00 in profit (not in sales). 
And what efforts does a trader have to put in to produce his $4000.00 profit? All he has to judge 
is: is it possible at this current level to see wheat very much lower, or, is Nature taking care of the 
farmer too once in a while? If he feels that lower prices are pretty much against the laws of Nature, 
against the laws of average, then he buys and waits until Nature brings the price up. When sickness 
overcomes man, he usually has to overcome a crisis, when things look very blue for him. "They" expect 
him to die most any moment, but he does not. He recuperates suddenly and runs like blazes towards 
recovery. They can't believe it but then he gets well. So markets. When it appears from reports that 
cotton isn't worth growing, that the boll weevil does not grow any more, that everyone wears Celanese 
clothes, cotton runs up from 7.50 to 9c and nothing is said about it any more. At 7.50 a pound nobody 
wanted it because they were waiting for 5c cotton. All other commodities operate in a similar way. Of 
course, at lows and at extreme highs trading commitments are comparatively easy to make out because 
there is but one way to act. It becomes more difficult when we are in the middle of a movement. At 
such times reactions get stronger and so do up moves. Therefore margins must be higher to protect 
commitments. But at periods such as the present period, when prices have declined for 2 1/2 years 
without let up, it is idle talk to expect them to still drop another 50 %. 
While banks are paying at the present time 2% to 2 1/2% interest, or on a sum of $8000.00 an 
amount of $160   per year, let us for comparison's sake assume that one has put out $8000.00 at 6%; this 
would then yield in one year the sum of $480.00. On eight contracts of wheat, with $1000.00 margin 
per contract, the profit with one single cents movement yields $400.00, and anyone knows that wheat 
moves normally (fluctuates) more than lc per day. So that unless one just buys at the top eighth of a 
strong move he is bound to make a profit even though it may just amount to the 6%. The big trouble 
with traders is the eagerness to make more, to make it in a great hurry. Supposing we have an upward 
movement and we buy. We expect a strong movement upward. As soon as we clear commission 
charges, the rest is clear profit. At one time we have to risk the commitment. Let us assume we take 
wheat or a stock like New York Central or Southern Pacific around 13 and 14. When the price has 
moved away from the original purchase price so as to clear commission charges and say an extra point 
or so, why not place a stop loss order just a little beyond the clearance point to let you off without a loss 
in case it would reverse itself? Of course, it would be unwise to do so the very first or second day after 
35
making the commitment, because the price has to work itself away from the level. However, should the 
price have gone ahead 4 or 5 points your way, it is an absolute necessity to place a protecting stop not 
less than 1 1/2 to 2 points away from the buying price in order to insure at least some profit, even 
though the stop might be taken up and the market might turn around then and move higher. In this case 
you have a profit clinched. Then you have to wait for another opportunity, which might come at higher 
or lower levels as the case may develop. There is never any very great rush to buy and there is no great 
rush to sell, provided you keep stop loss orders. Another very good rule to use is this: when in doubt, 
get out. If things are not clear to you as to what is likely to come out of a certain movement, get out; 
this stops worrying, and there is always again a chance to make commitments. 
Therefore, a person having a capital of $8000.00 to trade with may be sitting in a broker's office 
from the first of the month to the last day of the month and may have made but one single trade during 
that entire time and may have picked up just one single point net and that conservatively either up or 
down and just the same his income from that one trade would allow him a very good living and still he 
would have his capital intact. During a thirty-day period there are always times when a commitment is 
absolutely a cinch for a. point or even two. It is in that type of trading just a matter of sufficient patience 
to await that time. Who can and will do that? Not the gambler, not the long term investor, neither the 
small trader who likes to force the issue but one who enters the market from a business point of view. 
He will be in business for years and, while not in great favor among the customers' men, he is doing big 
favors to himself. 
I have taken as an example a small businessman such as the grocer and compared his income 
and work with that of a trader with like means. We can do the same way with smaller capital, $1000.00 
to $2000.00, but we have to reduce the amount likely to be earned accordingly and not turn around and 
say this man has to increase his risk accordingly. As soon as he does increase his risk, he is on the 
minus side before he even starts and it will not be long that "they" get him unaware. Never take more 
risk than any ordinary businessman would take and the profits will be much larger compared to his.

PREVIEW OF MARKETS FOR AUGUST 1939. 
 
The market for stocks should act pretty lively as we enter the month and events of early July 
should still play the major role in the movement. Usually the hardest thing for traders to do is to take 
profits; they are always anxious to buy stocks but very seldom anxious to cash in on the profits, if any 
accrue. It may be advisable to look for a ceiling by mid-August. 
When the July rise does develop as the previous cycle indicates it ought to continue into mid-
August, more exact, the 14th of the month should become a top. A reaction is then due over to the 27th 
of August. This reaction may come very close to the level prevailing at the beginning of the month. 
From then on we should turn around sharply and close the month at top levels most likely even a point 
or so beyond the mid August peak. A minor reaction is also shown for the first three days of August, 
which may become simply a sidewise movement for a few days to resume the advance. 
I would be inclined to take some profits mid-month, buying back after a ten days reaction or so, 
to sell once more just as we enter the month of September, or even on the last day of August. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF WHEAT DURING AUGUST, 1939 
 
The first week of the month points towards a reaction. After a sidewise movement from the 5th 
to the 11th a rally should ensue that should be accomplished in steps and produce a top formation 
between August 23rd to 27th. From that time on the trend should be downward, contrary to that of 
stocks for this period. It appears at the present time that the points lost from end of July to August 11th 
will be regained by August 27th; it is even likely that the end of July top that is indicated from the 
previous cycle will be exceeded somewhat. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON DURING AUGUST, 1939 
 
The forecast of cotton for this period seems to have a similarity to the movements of stocks for 
the same period. An upward movement is indicated from the entry into the month until the 14th, a 
rather swift short lived reaction over to the 17th and a sidewise movement towards the 26th and up the 
rest of the month. This tendency should keep up into September.

GRAIN MOVEMENTS, SPRING 1939 
 
On page 34 we have daily high and low charts of the various grains as they have been traded in 
markets. We find the following plotted: Chicago Corn, Chicago Oats, Chicago Rye, Chicago Wheat, 
Winnipeg Wheat, Liverpool Wheat and Winnipeg Barley. 
Upon a superficial glance at the charts we may say there WAS an up move, which was followed 
by a decline. Closer inspection will reveal the following: While a general uptrend can be noted in all the 
grains during April and May and a decline during June, the June reaction was against my own 
interpretation shown in the June issue where I had an important upward movement to start the end of 
May. If we would not be human or else if we would have had the charts before us as they show now at 
that time, we would have recognized immediately that while the previous cycle did have a sharp up 
move, in this present cycle that same movement turned into a down move. The change of trend 
nevertheless did occur and it did occur on account of a certain planetary combination that had been 
prevailing in the heavens end of May. The date of change I located last September already and not in 
April or in May. The reason for the movement to turn into a decline instead of an up movement end of 
May is unknown to me so far. Some people who know little or nothing about planetary effects cannot 
understand why such misinterpretation can happen, Some people say: "Why, planetary constellations 
have nothing to do with wheat or anything else. It's the rain in the mid-West that brought these prices 
down. If they only would know that it is only planetary constellations that bring about rain!  
All the grains of the American continent (see charts, page 34) made a bottom on March 16th, 
1939. Liverpool wheat, however, kept on going lower to March 30th, 1939. It was the first to make its 
top on May 5th, 1939. At that time Chicago Rye started its real up- move.  Several grains made their 
first top on May 11th, such as Corn, Oats, Winnipeg Wheat and Winnipeg Barley. Chicago made top on 
May 26th and May 31st   was the last top for all grains. A few made the second shoulder on that date, 
such as Corn, Winnipeg Barley, Winnipeg Wheat and even Liverpool Wheat has a corner on that day. 
Coming to the actual decline of June, we note that Corn, Oats and Winnipeg Barley were the 
least affected. Chicago Wheat had absolutely no pity upon traders, neither had Liverpool Wheat. 
Winnipeg Wheat gave them a little breathing spell mid-June only to follow downward once more. 
Liverpool and Winnipeg Wheat made new lows compared to the March low all the others held in the 
April range of prices. 
What I can see from the group of charts is this: An aspect that has bearing on grains in general 
caused a suction of prices upward from mid-March to end of May; then the aspect ended and gradually 
lost its grip. In my own forecast I had one aspect due to strike end of May that was to bring a new wave 
upward, but as we know, it failed to make its appearance. Consequently the other aspect, the mid-
March one, having passed, grains dropped back because the suction upward was over. What is very 
interesting is: The entire situation seems to have a relation to our latitude on earth. 
We know Liverpool's latitude on earth is 530 24’ 5”; that of Winnipeg 490 54' 10" and the 
latitude of Chicago is 410 50' 1''. We do not consider in this case the longitude of the three places on the 
earth. The differential in latitude between these three places is as follows: 
from Liverpool to Winnipeg 30 29’ 45” 
from Winnipeg to Chicago 80 4’ 19” 
from Liverpool to Chicago 110 34' 4". 
When we consider the days on which the various tops were made, via:  
Liverpool May 5th;  
Winnipeg May 11th;   
Chicago May 26th;  
and substitute the degree differentials in latitude of the three places at which wheat is being traded, 
Liverpool, Winnipeg and Chicago, we find the same ratio in the number of days elapsed from top to 
40
top. There are six days from Liverpool to Winnipeg and 15 days from Winnipeg to Chicago. Let us 
divide the latitudinal differences of the places with the days differentials and we get an average of 35-
38' of latitudinal motion of SOMETHING that strikes first at Liverpool and prevents it from going 
higher; after this the SOMETHING moves downward in latitude from Liverpool towards Winnipeg at a 
latitudinal speed of 35-38' per day. We hit the top in Winnipeg wheat on May 11th and, continuing at 
the same rate of speed until we reach Chicago’s latitude, we find Chicago makes its top on May 26, 
1939. 
 Not only is this noticeable with tops, but also when we check the lows of March 1939 when 
Chicago and Winnipeg made their low on March 16th, while Liverpool ignored the American rise 
completely and moved down until March 30th, 1939. That Liverpool makes the low last and Chicago, 
respectively, Winnipeg makes the low first suits perfects into the idea I wish to bring forth, since it 
gives us a rising latitudinal movement from bottom to top with Liverpool being affected last. When we 
construct a chart of this latitudinal motion of the SOMETHING, (page 32) we see immediately that the 
SOMETHING must have reached the north pole or 90deg point in latitude and then came downward 
again, striking Liverpool first and then the others. From the moment of its inception this movement kept 
going constantly (during all of April) even during the time the object passed the actual north pole, again 
while it moved down- wards until it passed the cities wherein grains are traded. The SOMETHING may 
move as far as 0 latitude, or else it may have its terminal in latitude at the place where grain cultivation 
ends. 
Checking over previous years of the three charts of grains I find the phenomenon recurring, 
although during 1938 it did not apply at all; all grains, Liverpool, Winnipeg and Chicago, made the 
important highs and lows within three days, in fact three consecutive days formed the low levels as well 
as the high levels; only during June we had an exception, when Chicago made its peak on June 15th, 
while Winnipeg and Liver- pool made their peaks on June 20th. My own explanation of this condition 
is: during 1938 the SOMETHING was moving very rapidly, while during 1939 it moved very slowly. 
While it is possible that it is always one and the same object that affects, there is a possibility that the 
changes of 1938 were brought about by some other object. 
Mr. Einstein brought forth an assertion a few months ago that he suspects the causes of our 
troubles are more to be sought in the planet Mercury instead of in the Sun. I am working with that 
planet for years and know that long ago. The great difficulty we are faced with is that Mercury contains 
some 25 different motions in reference to our earth or to the Sun. To plot them all on one chart is 
simply impossible; to check them all is still worse. To know them all and then figure them all out from 
day to day is another story. There are motions in the planet Mercury that are used only by astronomers; 
there are motions that are only used by astrologers and there are motions in him that are not used by 
either of them and these motions seem to be the ones that have to be used in order to detect movements 
of prices irrespective of who is behind the price, a commodity or a stock. It is interesting to note that 
Chicago corn moved similar to Winnipeg wheat during this period. 
 
OVERHEARD IN BROKERS OFFICES 
 
A well educated, native American bought in an office some Pittsburgh Screw Co. stock. About 
an hour later a friend of his dropped into the office and, even important people are given to gossiping, 
he immediately had to tell his friend about his purchase. So, I heard him say: (of course, being in a 
hurry to convey the news to the other man he seemed to have forgotten all about the name of the stock 
he invested his good money in) Jack, I just bought some Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Stove and Pipe and 
Chimney, or whatever the heck they make.

INTRODUCTORY 
 
The present issue of "Preview" brings additional details of great importance, laying down gradually 
our philosophy. To some readers the relationship of these thoughts to markets and their movements 
may appear far hauled. As we get deeper into the drift of things and have laid the foundation 
thoroughly, we then will shift into more lively subjects about individual commodities and stocks, their 
performance and the reasons for such performance. 
Practically all the articles produced so far are not for a one time reading but they can be studied 
and disected time and again to obtain the deeper meaning hidden therein. 
Those who have missed an issue can obtain same at the regular rate as long as available. 
 
Carmel, Calif., August 20th, 1939. 
 
PROTECTING ACCOUNTS 
 
It often times requires certain strategies to act right when markets do not perform as we expect. 
In this article I shall try to bring ways and means to overcome difficulties so that we do not let 
ourselves grow gray hairs over night by failing to use common sense and act quick. 
In one case, back in 1932, when a trader saw his stock drop headlong, instead of acting, and 
cutting short his loss, he went off with his car for a spin and let the good Lord take care of his stock. 
Coming back just before the close of the market he saw stocks down another few points, and decided to 
wait just another day. This procedure he kept up till the margin clerk went into action and sold. 
When a house is afire, the firemen try to extinguish it with water. When stocks or commodities 
do not move according to expectations, act, to save something. Prices flow; so does money, it flows into 
someone else's pocket. We cannot always expect the tide to run our way; we also have to contend with 
an outgoing tide. Protect yourself, no body else will. We have several means of protection. These 
protections are easier to use with commodities than with stocks. 
 
PROTECTION No. 1: Stop loss order.
In order to determine where to place a stop loss order for a stock or a commodity we must 
weigh the market as a whole, the volume of trading, the price level of the market in general, the 
forecast, what the market should do and the "Weekly Analysis", if you are a subscriber to it. 
When the market is near a low level and quiet, a stop-loss should be rather close to the low 
level. When it is broken, it will be broken suddenly and a fast move will follow downward. See the lard 
and cottonseed oil performance July 1 - 10, 1939. 
When the market is in high levels and big volume is present, one usually does well by stepping 
out altogether without using stop loss orders since high level plus big volume indicates that someone 
who ought not to have stocks is buying from those who bought cheap. Newspapers help them a great 
deal by flashing across the front page all the good news about the big rise just when it is ending. 
If the forecasts points upward and the market covering the time of the forecast sells off (wheat 
June 1939) the best way would be to get out and wait or put a stop loss a few points below. The 
peculiarity and difficulty of making forecasts bring it about that once in a while one of those rays 
coming from the planets has been interpreted wrongly and instead of a steady advance for a fixed 
period, the entire move becomes a steady decline during this same period. This is not an error made by 
the planet; he knows what he wants - but a human error which through more work can be gradually 
rectified,---- but such future work does not help the trader at that critical moment; he must act and act 
43
quick and fast and----jump out before the house burns down. At times it is even advisable to take a 
reverse position at the same moment, especially if chart indications have it that a reversal into the 
original direction is very unlikely, until the time element has exhausted itself. 
The least one should do is: when a strong move is indicated in the forecast to place a stop loss 
order a few points below the price of the day the movement should begin. In case a three-point stop is 
taken, not much can be expected of the move anymore anyhow. 
 
PROTECTION No. 2  Hedging.
Aside of protecting an account with stop loss orders, we may turn also toward hedging the 
commitment. Hedging means simply to take simultaneously the opposite side for a while. Of course, 
we cannot be long of 100 shares of US Steel and hedge by selling short 100 shares of the same stock. 
This would put us into neutral altogether. However, when long of "Steel" we may hedge by selling 100 
shares of Bethlehem or 100 shares of National Steel. In wheat, we may be long in September, and when 
we put out a hedge we may go short the same amount in the December option. When hedging 
commodities we always should try to hedge on the short side the weakest option and on the long side 
the strongest one. By this I mean: if long and you want to hedge don't go short in the strongest option 
but in the weakest. And, when short in wheat and the market moves against you upward, and you 
decide to hedge, don't hedge in the weak or slowly moving option but in the strongest one. This case we 
had nicely illustrated in Cotton last fall, when all options were fairly strong and holding while October 
was the weak brother. On days of declining prices, the average option would drop 2 or 3 points, while 
October cotton at that time would lose 7 and 8 points a day. Since such conditions arise, the wrong 
hedge will cause additional losses instead of offsetting losses which is really the purpose of a hedge. 
Among New York traders and specialists, so-called, I remember that they hedge lard against 
cottonseed oil or cotton against cottonseed oil. This procedure is not good and will result in big losses 
once these commodities at times move together and at times move just the opposite way. One would 
think off hand that in as much as cotton and cottonseed oil are of one and the same plant they should 
move together. But they do it at times and at others not at all. They act like two brothers; sometimes 
they harmonize but sometimes they disagree. 
Hedging throws you practically into neutral, a further drop will increase the value of the short 
side and at the same time bring losses to the long position, thus offsetting the plus by the minus. At 
some time, however, one side of the hedge must be "lifted," i.e. released. This is only done when the 
market has stabilized itself or you have stabilized yourself so as to recognize which way the "cat 
jumps." If you are satisfied that the decline has gone far enough, then cover the short and hold the long 
or else, if you believe the rally or rise has gone far enough, drop the long position and hold on to the 
short position. From this time on you are on a one way track again. The entire cost of a hedge is the 
commission for carrying the "other side" for a while. 
 
PROTECTION No. 3: Doubling up. 
Suppose you are long of wheat. The action of wheat has become poor; wheat declines. It starts 
to break important resistance points. You might not have hedged yet; you might not have placed a stop 
loss order. Things look bad and you are long. In that case, a fast and rapid thinking process has to 
develop and you may decide to double up, i.e. sell your longs and go short the very same amount you 
have been long. However, let me warn you! It is very dangerous unless done on rallies (the doubling-up 
to the short side). I know of one case where I actually saw a fellow drop $4500 inside of 30 minutes by 
doubling up in JMP (Johns Mansville) with 100 shares. This was in 1931, when JMP sold between 90 
and 101 in March or April. Things moved fast then and he moved fast too, and he just happened to 
44
reverse or double-up "at the market," getting bottoms and tops just the wrong way. His trades actually 
were with 200 shares, since 100 shares long had to be sold and 100 shares had to be taken short on one 
and the same trade. Afterwards, the short position in the 100 shares had to be covered again and 100 
shares had to be bought long so as to be on the long side. 
 
PROTECTION No. 4: Get out and wait. 
 
When markets move fast and one is wrongly committed, instead of looking, waiting, hoping, 
expecting, asking, reading reports, and all sorts of other ways and means to prevent you from acting and 
acting fast, it is at all times a good policy to just merely get out for what you can get and then----- wait. 
Markets are here every day. Your mind works better when the nervousness cools off. When nervous, 
a man does one foolish thing after the other. His mind is not under full control. When you see a fellow 
walk up and down in a broker's office, move from one chair to the other, read a line in the newspaper, 
run up to read the news ticker, this man is the one I mean who should liquidate his holdings right there 
and then and go home and wait. He will be a nervous wreck in no time and will wind up with forced 
losses. This was exactly the way that man described above acted who lost the $4500 in thirty minutes. 
Don't let yourself get that far! 
 
PROTECTION No. 5: Do not overtrade. 
This was discussed last month. 
There is just one more thought in mind about hedging. Back in 1937, on April 7th, to be exact, 
just after passing the top of the bull movement, I saw the change developing and I sent out several 
hundred wires to my clients at that time (many will remember it when they read this), stating: hedge 
wheat and cotton (in stocks we had been short since March 9th, 1937). What happened? Most traders 
hedged, but some did not because the customer's man did not know what to do. He had never heard of a 
hedge, except of a privet hedge. The way the trader should have approached the broker would have 
been: Sell the same amount of wheat or cotton, which I am long now in the next option. Taking the case 
of 1937, when we were long in May contracts, the client should have said: sell me the same amount of 
July contracts. He could not have misunderstood such an order. 
 
MANY THOUGHTS LOOSELY CONNECTED 
 
There is a trait in human beings to make things appear in a different light. The neatly manicured 
and painted fingernails of the girls should indicate to the observer that they belong to the leisure class. 
The neatly pressed pants, the best suit is worn for an interview. The subtlest speech is used during such 
interviews. When the job is landed and the fellow starts to work he needs his overalls and occasionally 
some strong, healthy language to produce. Then he is the normal man, who shows his weaknesses and 
his virtues. 
Many, many years ago there lived people among the masses who through years of hard work

and testing (how they actually could do it in a practical way is beyond my comprehension) found rules 
about determining the future. They developed this science to such state of completeness and exactness 
that they most likely could say: this day must be a top in wheat and that day a bottom in cotton and that 
was that. In the interim they had plenty of time on hand to do something else. Just like parents are 
anxious for their children to have them learn and acquire as much knowledge as possible and teach 
them before they have to part, these men, no doubt were also looking out for their children, in this case 
for the later generations of mankind to teach them what they knew. But how was this to be done? They 
could not just blurt out and tell everybody the laws. Very few would understand them anyhow. They 
did what everybody else does to this day: They wrote the laws covered in a coat like a mummy is 
covered with cloth. They substituted certain words for others, many they kept in their original meaning. 
They produced a "code" which can be deciphered if enough time is spent on it and the essence of the 
contents, are grasped. That the great scientists of our time are working in the wrong direction on any of 
their attempts to explain the Bible can be readily seen when we read the mass of foot notes brought 
below the text in works like the Apocrypna and Pseudepigrapa. They have done wonderful work to 
translate from the original language   word for word, sense or no sense. When certain phrases gave no 
sense to them they marked them as "corrupt," but just the same they printed them because something 
told them: they are needed. 
The scientist's drift of thought is: The words as written must mean what is commonly 
understood by these words. They forget all about that the Bible is full of parables, and, what may 
interest you the most is that I found that the word parable means actually a mathematical parable, a 
parabola and "talk" means: to move. 
It bothers the scientists very little that all the figures of the Bible are constantly on the "move". 
They take them for ancient nomads or roamers. If they would only add "of the sky," they would hit the 
nail.  
While we talk about parabolas, we just as well hint for a moment at "fabula" which is the Latin 
word for "talk" and talk means movement (substantive), so that Aesop's Fables are nothing but 
movements of the Animals, but which ones? The ones commonly understood or those up above? Think 
that out yourself.  
That the word "talk" was very cleverly chosen as a substitute for "walk" may be seen when you 
read back the first four words of the last sentence: "While we talk about parabolas," meaning by 
substitution while we move about in cycles. Do we move in cycles or don't we?  
For all people who can think it must appear strange that the Church back in 1582   decided all of 
a sudden that our astronomical calculations were all wet and that we have to jump 10 days to get into 
the right rhythm. What have they to do with planetary movements? Should such a change not have 
come from astronomers who specialize in planetary movements? or, is it the Church which does its own 
work with such movements? 
At that time the command to change the astronomical calendar was simply accepted in all 
countries with the exception of England and Russia. The former accepted the change about 80 years 
later. It did not sound logical to them to just merely change around the dates, because they, as a group 
knew not the reason and the reason could not be explained but was a matter of believing. See 
Ephemeris of 1582. 
I have it from a reliable source that when a youngster wants to study for priesthood and wants to 
enter a school to study, he is required to produce first of all data about his birth from several sources 
who keep official records. These data have to be furnished before they let him know whether or not he 
will be allowed to start the course. The average family of such a boy takes such requests as a matter of 
routine, but, when we think about it, does it not feel strange that a school is so deeply interested about 
birth data? It seems to me that these data are sent to some place to undergo close scrutiny. There may be 
some monasteries in existence, which make a specialty of working up horoscopes. 
46
When we look over the mass of material that is required to figure movements, much of which at 
present is worked up by specialists, astronomers, who devote all their time to follow mathematically all 
the planets and produce their exact daily position to seconds, we cannot help but arrive at the following 
conclusion. 
Science was throughout the ages in the hands of the clergy. So was the Bible. Somehow, some 
way its true meaning was perpetuated among a few. These few had their assistants do the necessary 
clerical work without recognizing the purpose of such work. The machine might have worked as 
follows: Hundreds of monasteries all over Europe were divided into sections. One had to figure the 
movements of the Sun, another of the Moon, a third of Venus. There might have been 20 different ones 
assigned to figure planet Venus, since it contains about that many individual motions. This way all the 
work was distributed and then sent to the "operating table" at Rome where specialists who knew what 
to do with the Tables used them. As strange as it may sound to get thoughts of this kind, but I never saw 
Rome on the wrong side of the fence when it came to a war. Did you? Whenever one begins you find 
them immediately on the side of the eventual winner. During the Spanish war they recognized 
immediately Mr. Franco, the rebel. This way they temporarily became actually an ally of Germany who 
also was helping Franco as shown from newspaper reports. 
Mr. Hitler seems to be a very quiet fellow. He talks not often. But, when he does talk, things 
just fly and before anyone is aware of what happens, it's all over. This way he bagged Austria, this way 
he got a hold of Bohemia, this way he most likely will get Danzig, and the very same way he may get 
all the colonies. The same way fights happen in Munich beer Halls. You may enjoy there a mug of beer 
sitting among the crowds, when all of a sudden, with one accord, mugs full or empty begin to fly, 
chairs come next, even tables move with unbelieving speed through space-----a fight is on. After 
ambulances haul away the injured, the old harmony originally prevailing is resumed and everything is 
lovely. Markets do the same, of course; after the quiet meetings of June this year a sudden scramble for 
stocks ensued in July. The averages ran up from 128 to 145   before most people realized what had 
happened. 
Turning back to Mr. Hitler, some people claim he has clever astrological advisers who are able 
to pick the dates when things are propitious for him to act. Personally, I do not believe it, else the 
financial position of the country would be better; they would be able to take advantage of the ups and 
downs of commodity prices and benefit enormously. 
Here is another thought that merits consideration. 
Why do we use a sun year? Why is it not appropriate to use a Mercury year, or a Jupiter year, or 
a Saturn year? Or some other planetary year?∗Somebody years ago must have deemed it advisable to 
make us move by the Sun year and even that one they changed on us back in 1582. Why do the non-
believers in cosmic forces use a year anyhow? Even by using it they admit that cosmic forces make us 
do things, even though they don't say it. They admit that our little Moon (compared to space) causes the 
tides which brings about a rise of billions of tons of water with each change and a subsequent recession, 
but they are too ignorant to understand that planets are emanating rays that affect the ten ounces of our 
brains in such a way that we do just what they (the rays) want us to do. 
And this is just it that makes markets: people are made to buy and are made to sell so that tops 
and bottoms are made at the right and exact time planetary forces indicate any time in advance. The 
figuring to find or locate such tops and bottoms according to laws shown in the Scriptures is another 
story. 
Several times I told you about keeping charts of stocks and commodities to trace and follow 
their performance from day to day. The same procedure you may do with your own life and, I am sure 
many of you will be able to trace ahead the future when applying   the common laws of trend line, 
ellipse, new highs, new lows, etc. This may be done to plot financial conditions, health (a health chart) 
or business in general. Gaps* must be watched carefully. For example, someone's life goes on merrily 
47
for many years on even keel. Suddenly, something happens: "a gap", watch this gap and figure from 
this point anew: it may be up, it may be down. Observe that way the movement of your bank deposits 
and plot them either daily or monthly. Know that on important turns we get double tops and double 
bottoms; we also get single tops such as a sweepstake winning but single tops are hardly ever 
overcome. For example, a business man those average business amounts to say $5000 per year lands 
suddenly a contract amounting to $15,000. Unless another one follows in short order, I would say: this 
was the peak of the business and that business will drop below the normal mark in due time, in fact the 
big order moved him into bear market. On the other hand, when things are very bad and the end seems 
to be approaching, a slight improvement should be hailed as bullish, especially so, if a gap is made 
upward (see cotton on April 16, 1939). By this gap I mean: something arrives that was not the least 
expected and it was favorable in this case. Supposing you have taken a series of small losses, including 
a few big ones for good measure, you get scared to make new commitments because you expect more 
losses. However, the commitment turns out profitable. The next one also, possibly even more profitable 
than the first. In this case your chart would show a gap upwards and, should there even a reaction creep 
in, the gap is not likely to be closed and a bull movement is in the making for you and profits will pile 
up again. 
 
* A gap is a space left open in the price structure between one days trading and that of the following day. 
 
In the first volume I mentioned the 22 Jewish letters according to which the Lord created the 
World. The picture of a spider web, taken outside of my workshop reminded me of these 22 letters too; 
so the spider is even smarter than a lot of scientists who make faces at Mr Mars. This "Spider and his 
web'' knows more about the Bible than they ever will. Can you see it too? (see Illustration above).

MOTIONS 
 
On page 36 of the last issue I mentioned that the various planets have so many and so varied 
motions in respect to our earth as well as the Sun and of themselves, mentioning some 25 varieties of 
motion belonging to Mercury alone. All the other planets have similar motions. 
Here is a list of motions belonging to: 
Mercury: 
1. Mercury's geocentric longitudinal movement. This represents the movement of Mercury in longitude 
measured as seen from the earth. 
This motion may be direct, retrograde or stationary. Direct means that its motion is in the order of the 
zodiacal signs; retrograde means that its motion is contrary to the order of the signs of the zodiac. 
Stationary mean that at certain fixed moments it has no motion whatever but stands still in the zodiac. 
Example: On August 19th, 1939 noon London, Mercury's position is 12o 14' in the sign of Leo 
retrograde; on the 20th it reaches 12o 9' of Leo and there becomes stationary. The day after, on August 
2lst, 1939 it moves forward again so that at noon of that day its place is 12o 11' in Leo. All these 
positions are geocentric. 
2. Mercury's heliocentric Longitude (Mean Equinox of Date) for the same days is as follows: 
 
August 19th, 1939  
350o 21' 46",  4;  
 
August 20th, 1939  
354o 55' 41", 0;  
August 21st, 1939  
359o 38'   8", 7 
These positions are midnight positions London (0 hours) of the days. When we express these values in 
signs, we obtain: 20o 21' Pisces, 24o 55' Pisces and 29o 38' Pisces, values that are completely different 
from the geocentric values. 
3. Mercury has also two sorts of Latitudes, geocentric, the other heliocentric. On August 19th 
Mercury's geocentric position is at 2o 56' South and on the 21st of the month it is at 2o 21' South.    
4. The heliocentric positions of Mercury for she same dates are as follows:  
August 19th: 1939  
5o 53' 56"  
7;  
August 21st: 1939  
5o 12' 52"  
9;  
Both values are minus, i.e. below the celestial Equator. 
5. Next comes the declination of Mercury. It shows in the ephemeris that the declination for August 
19th at noon is 14o 19' North, and on the 2lst it is 14o 53' North. 
6. We have the apparent right ascension of the planet. This value is not expressed in degrees but in 
hours, minutes and seconds. In our example we find that on August 19th, 1939 the apparent right 
ascension of Mercury at 0 Hours London is 8h 55' 36", 22; on August 21st, it is 8 h 55' 34", 29; on the 
20th it is 8h 55' 20", 52. 
This apparent right ascension is the very same thing as the geocentric longitude of the planet; only one 
is expressed in hours, minutes and seconds, while the other is expressed in degrees, minutes and 
seconds of the Zodiac. The makers of the ordinary ephemeredes just take the right ascension and 
convert it into geocentric longitude; 24hours equal 360 degrees in this case, and 0 hours, 0', 0" 
represents 0 Aries 0' 0". 
7.The next item to consider is the true distance of the planet from the earth, which varies from day to 
day. Of the dates in question this true distance is as follows: 
August 19th,   
0.701279 
August 20th,         
0.719863 
August 21st,     
0.739840 
8. Not only does this position require consideration, but also the differentials of these distances, which 
are: 
49
between August 19th and August 20th plus 18584, 
between August 20th and August 21st plus 19977.  
These differentials bring the planet to an extreme far distance as well as to an extreme near distance to 
the earth. 
9. The semi-diameter of Mercury changes also constantly. It shows that on August 19th this semi-
diameter of Mercury is 4'', 76 and on August 21st it is 4", 51 at 0 hours London. 
l0. The horizontal parallax varies also from day to day. We find it to be on August 19th 12", 55 and on 
August 21st 11", 89. 
11.The time of the transit over the Meridian of Washington is also of importance. On August 19th the 
transit occurs at 11h 7' and on August 21st at 11 h 0'. 
 
Explanations of a few Latin words and sentences: 
Positus planetarum diurnus:   
noon positions of planets 
Latitudo planetarum ad die:   
Latitude of planets on the day 
Syzygiae Lunares:  
 
 
 
 
Moon aspects 
Anni veteris:   
 
 
 
 
old years 
Anni Gregor:   
 
 
 
 
Gregorian years 
cu or cum, with; 
cauda, the tail; 
the names following the Moon aspects represent the various fixed stars which are passed, such 
as hydra, the water snake: Rigel, Orion, Hercules, Arcturus, Lyre, Stellis fixis, fixed stars. 
Die, the day 
The hours given in the Table of Syzygiae lunares as well as planetarum mutuae are up to 24 
hours. 
The Ephemeris was made for Bologna, Italy, noon.  
12. The value arising from the reduction to Orbit which, contains the correction to be applied to the 
heliocentric longitude in order to obtain the longitude measured along the orbit of the planet.  This orbit 
longitude is equal to the distance from the mean equinox to the node, plus the distance from the node to 
50
the planet.   
 
 
August 19th this value is minus 11’41", 7 
August 21st this value is minus 12’ 47", 9 
13. The next value of importance is the Radius Vector of the ellipse. This value is given in logarithms 
and represents the distance of the center of the planet from that of the Sun. The values for our dates are: 
August 19th 
 9.5634116 
 
August 21st 
9.5495621 
14.  The differentials of the logs also form a sort of a motion. They are: 
Between August 19th and 20th, minus 69102 
Between August 20th and 21st, minus 69303 
15. The stellar magnitude of the planet from day to day is another item that requires watching.  During 
August this magnitude diminishes from 2.8 to 0 and covers in this time August 9th to August 29th.  
There is a plus and a minus side to the magnitude. 
16. The illuminated disk of Mercury represents another important item. We can distinguish 4 kinds of 
motions and not one has anything to do with the other except that they pertain to Mercury’s disk. 
16a. ( 16 )  The ratio of the area of the illuminated portion of the apparent disk to the area of the entire 
apparent disk regarded as circular. This value changes as follows during August 1939: 
 
August 14th 
0,026  
 
August 19th 
0,111        
 
August 24th 
0,265    
16b. ( 17) The angle between the Sun and the Earth as seen from the planet. 
This value changes very rapidly and the figures for August are: 
 
August 14th 
162
August 19th 
141
August 24th 
118
16c. (18) The angle, which the line joining the cusps, or extremities of the illuminated portion, makes 
with the meridian. This angle is of great importance due to its swift change causing there by changes in 
the human brains as to wanting something and not wanting it shortly thereafter. To show the fast 
changes occurring with this angle I have to bring its size over a few months: 
July    25th 
26° 
August 4th 
41° 
August 9th 
76° 
August 14th 
160° 
August 19th 
183° 
August 24th 
191° 
Sept. 3th 
202° 
l6d. (19) The next value of interest is the brilliancy of the disk. Also this value undergo swift changes 
as shown below: 
July 30th 
19.1 
August 4th 
9.8 
August 9th 
2.5 
August l 4th 
4.6 
August l 9th 
18.9 
August 24th 
39.7 
 
51
Besides these actual motions in space which all belong to but one planet (Mercury), we must not forget 
that there are fixed places of great importance whose proper motion in space is very small so as to be 
negligent for our work. The planet crossing over these spots requires attention: 
20. Mean longitude of node (Mercury) 47° 36' 29", 4 
21. Mean longitude of Perihelium (Mercury) 76° 30' 22", 8 
22. Mean longitude at the Epoch (Mercury) 149° 59' 50", 79 
Thus, we can see that the average astrologer who plays around with the geocentric longitude of the 
planets does not use nor even think of the many other motions contained in one simple planet, all of 
which must be considered and weighed as to their possible effect. 
In the event you are sufficiently interested to learn more about the effects of some of these motions and 
how they bring forth tops and bottoms in stocks and commodities, write me for a special course of 
instruction on this subject. 
All we have done here was analyze roughly Mercury's motions. We have 6 more planets to contend 
with. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto we don't need since they are not useful for our work. They are 
intensifying certain spots but that's all.

FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR SEPTEMBER 1939 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FOR STOCKS! 
 
Labor Day brings usually a change of trend. They also say in New York brokerage offices: “Sell 
them on Rosh-Hashanah and buy them on Yom Kippur.” Rosh-Hashanah, the Hebrew New Year, falls 
on Thursday, September 14th, while Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement falls on Saturday, September 
23rd. I have quite often noticed that there is some truth to this rule, but this year the rule should not 
work so good. 
Labor Day falls on September 4th, a Monday. As said before, we usually can expect a change of 
direction over the holidays (Sunday, Sept. 3rd and Monday, Sept. 4th). This year should not be an 
exception. 
As we enter the month of September, the market should be boiling and good prices should prevail. 
This should be a top for a while from which distribution of stocks should begin, especially so if the last 
four or five days of August have been real strong and bullish feeling has come into the masses.  In that 
case would dispose of all long stocks before we close for the holidays. Leading issues would even short 
right there and cover these shorts by the 11th of the month, which is a Monday. At the same time would 
then resume long positions, expecting a gradual comeback to the end of the month for a secondary top. 
It should fall short a little compared to the top, which is expected just before Labor Day. The last few 
days of the month, September 28th to 30th, would sell out again all longs and resume short positions on 
strength for another dip into October. 
The range of movements during September could amount to some ten points in the averages, 
and the lows of August might even be violated by a few points, just the same it should not be the 
beginning of a bear movement as yet for stocks: on the contrary, we can expect a trading market at high 
levels for quite some time to come. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
 
The performance of wheat should have been rather poor during August and the rally mid-August 
should also have petered out.  After Labor Day a few days of strength are shown, followed by another, 
rather swift drop to new low ground. This sharp drop should begin by September 10th and end by 
September 18th. A rally should ensue for the balance of the month. This rally, however, should not be 
worth much and for October another dip is indicated. While wheat prices should be at very low levels, 
they are such that they wear out most any trader in that new lows are likely to appear after run-ups. 
These run-ups should thus be used for selling and not for buying wheat with the idea of a new bull 
movement being inaugurated at this time. The picture may look more like the cocoa performance 
during the first half of the year. I would keep close stops on all long positions in wheat at this period. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECTOF COTTON: 
 
Cotton should be getting strong as we enter the month and the steady price improvement that began 
last March should reach a climax this month, a major top. This top is indicated for September 23-26, 
Yom Kippur. A steady continued climb should be witnessed up to this time. On the dates given would 
switch from long to short and hold these positions into October. I would do so specially if we get big 
volume, strong advances and good news about scarcity of cotton. By the end of September cotton 
should be through with its bull cycle. 
53
Special notice: As you know, the forecasts are all made up by using apparent repeating cycles of 
what has happened previously. These forecasts for quite long periods have followed very well the 
actual developments; only at intervals Nature seems to throw a crow-bar into the sequence by 
producing exactly 100% counter move, whereby length, time, beginning and end correspond exactly 
just the same. We had this case in wheat during the first three weeks of June. We must guard ourselves 
against such occurrences. The first requisite of protection is a daily high and low chart of wheat in case 
you trade in wheat, or of cotton, if you trade in cotton, or of the averages if you trade in stocks and of 
the individual stocks which you trade in. The next requisite is a reasonable margin so that an 
unexpected move can be survived without being injured too much. Requisite number three is: learn all 
you can learn about movements, possibilities and impossibilities. Back year charts, which may be 
copied out of newspapers from the library will reveal more than anything else. We must know for 
example that commodities can rise in a straight line upwards for eight to ten months and gain 800 to 
1000 points during such a time; they can drop that much too, when we are in bear markets and, what is 
very important, the declines are usually occurring much faster than rises. Wheat can gain one full dollar 
in a year and, while doing so, can have reactions of 20 to 30c several times and just the same be bullish. 
Therefore, a 10c margin for wheat, except at very low levels, is dangerous, to say the least. Books, 
wherein valuable rules about trading are given such as "Time Factors," and others, should be studied, 
since any one who specializes in a field of endeavor must be equipped with basic knowledge. 
The next requisite for protection of any reader who follows my forecasts is: when a movement 
does not develop as analyzed and the market has not gone too far, liquidate and wait, or else reverse, by 
following the counter trend as long as the forecast shows one direction, even though it would be the 
contrary direction. This last idea is somewhat dangerous to follow since it is contrary to the previous 
cycle whose true direction will be taken up at times rather suddenly (a cross aspect might bring about 
such a condition temporarily). Since the market is here all the time, we might just as well wait and 
watch. When a house is afire we try to extinguish it. When our forecast proves faulty once in a great 
while, it is of no use letting the market get the best of us, but let us extinguish the fire as fast as we can, 
by jumping out, clearing all positions for the time being. Then, when a propitious turn is shown, get 
aboard again.

NEW DISCOVERIES 
 
Discoveries are coming pretty thick with me these days and here are some works mentioned 
which I am now sure of that they are all treating one and the same subject but with different coats; they 
are all old Text Books on Astrology: 
l.  The Bible and all those works, which are called Scriptures; 
2. All the Egyptian writings on papyri, on tablets or on tombs; 
3. All the old tales (Maerchen) such as the 7 Dwarves; 
4. All the stories of 1001 Nights and other stories from Arabia; 
5. All the myths, be they Greek or Roman. 
And---I am not venturing too far-- when I say: all the figures and persons irrespective of their 
names as well as all the places where the events are supposed to have happened which date before the 
year 1400. 
Everything supposedly coming from beyond that time are absolute inventions, produced by 
astrologers who knew the laws of planetary movements completely and their main work consisted of 
producing or preserving these laws in all sorts of forms for future generations. They all were begun at 
certain planetary constellations thus insuring permanent preservation. 
You may object vehemently to such ideas and say: what about the Roman coins that bring the 
heads of Caesar and others? True, some of the Emperors might have lived, but the stories printed about 
them are explaining planetary movements, which were embodied in these persons. 
Take the pain and read 1001 Nights. Note: that the heroes always are absent for one year; 
sometimes they make it ten years to change the situation some. However, the meaning is: now, we go 
one cycle forward. The story of the "Fisher and the Ghost" for example brings four planetary positions. 
It then lists commodities, which should be bought when the first planetary position prevails; then it 
brings commodities, which must be bought when the second planetary condition is present and so forth. 
Later on after discussing the "porter" loaded with the victuals it explains clearly when the various 
commodities must be sold again, i.e. depending upon other planetary positions. This story is one of the 
best to illustrate commodity trading. Other stories treat about other things of life. The plots are so 
cleverly chosen, so intriguing, and revealing the exact laws of astrology, i.e., the effect of planetary 
movements upon our ten ounces of brains, which the scientists explain away as being "products of a 
dazed mind" and why is this possible? Because the scientists fail to recognize the first Law about 
mankind: We are just doing what we are told to do according to our moment of birth, singly, as group 
(sailors, carpenters, stock traders, doctors) as well as Nations and finally as a people that belongs into 
the present era and not into another. 
In all these works note especially the slow and gradual build-up. First we have to do with one or 
two persons and with a simple plot; this establishes the "planetary positions." After this all persons 
begin to move; they cry and marry and make trips; they laugh and plough the field. Most of these active 
verbs mean definite sorts of movements in predefined sectors of the Zodiac, so that one who grasps the 
meaning of a few words once, will, by trial and error, be able to fasten down additional words until he 
gets a brand new dictionary. So that for example, each time I read in any of these books that someone 
"cries" I merely underline the true word for it: ''to move retrograde" and keep on reading. He, who cries, 
moves retrograde. Which planet is meant by it is identified by the name given to the person. There may 
be 5000 or even more names found in all these works, just the same we have but 7 planets to use; they 
are nicely divided among them and I have discovered also the identification of most of these names and 
which planets are meant, becomes rather easy after a while. 
Yes, market movements can be safely traced when we follow Harun Arraschid of the 1001  Nights, at 
least that is what I found! More about it in the next issue.

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION IN THE INTEREST OF 
STOCKS AND COMMODITY TRADERS 
All statements made in this publication are George Bayer's personal opinion. They are based upon apparent recurring cycles 
of time and price. The forecasts given herein, while made with the utmost care are not guaranteed. 
 
WHAT VALUES HAVE OLD THINGS? 
 
As stated in another place I like to buy old books. Let me substitute the word "seasoned" for 
"old." Newspapers, for example, are read one day and then thrown away; magazines are used a little 
longer, since their contents are such as to make them readable at any time, especially if it is a story 
magazine. But, we may not really say "any time" since this application would go too far. Let us just 
think back thirty years or so and read over stories written at that period. They feel strange, certain 
references to conditions, to style, mode of transportation, gossip of that time, etc., do not fit any more 
into our surroundings. We do not live in that time any more. 
Books of a scientific nature last much longer. Herschel's Astronomy, published more than 100 
years ago sounds and reads like a scientific book published yesterday. It has value in itself. The laws 
given therein have stood the test of time since they were correct and true. Anything that is true will 
stand for a long time. About the value of religious books, fables and tales we have enlarged already. 
Something of value is usually cheap and not expensive. You can buy Bibles for a quarter at 
Woolworth's. Tales and fables can be had in most second hand bookshops on the nickel counter, since; 
when youngsters have grown beyond reading such books they are sold for junk. 
Many valuable pieces of art, pictures, paintings, furniture, most everything contained in homes 
of rich people can be had for the proverbial song at public auctions. I am not speaking of small country 
auctions but of those held at art galleries. Rich people die; the heirs want the cash; entire estates are 
then sold at auctions for what they bring. Cheap stuff is bunched together and sold in lots, usually at a 
dollar a whole basket or a case full of ware. More valuable goods are sold by the piece to the highest 
bidder. When you visit one of these places, it puzzles you quite often that some articles that approach 
more the goods handled at stores bring much better prices than those not handled in stores. The reason 
for it is that people don't know what is of value. In one of the auctions at Irvington, N. Y., a year or so 
ago there was a bunch of colored candles, six to a box. They brought between $1.75 to $2.50 a box 
straight through, although in the stores you buy them for $0.50 a box. On the other hand, an 
Encyclopedia Britannica, which was on the shelves for three years, brought $30.00. It had never been 
used. In an auction out on Long Island last fall, a friend of mine acquired a brand new silver set for 
$200.00, which does not retail for less than $500; a few carpets, real Persians, he picked up for $250; 
try and get them in a store for less than $700 or $800. But, one has to know what he is buying. 
Everything is for sale, but there is a difference. 
The stock market (also the commodity markets) is full of bargains every day. The bargains may 
be on the upside or on the downside. 
How can we judge which ones are on the bargain counter and which ones are not? 
When it comes to buying, I have one good rule for you: the older the stock, the safer it is to buy. 
It may go down on you, but it is very unlikely that it burst and moves to zero. Time tested the stock. It 
went through the1931-1932 market, through the 1921 market, possibly already through the 1907 panic. 
Stocks that could survive these shocks should survive many others. An old stock has a record. The 
fluctuations from day to day are available for years back. A new stock may be all right, in fact, it might 
be even better than the old ones, but I prefer old books to new books. 
57
Old stamps are worth more than new ones; I know that as a stamp collector. Old paintings are 
worth more than others; the Torah, written with black fire on white fire, 2000 years before the heaven 
and the earth were made should be worth more than all the modernistic ideas of the present age. 
If a stock has been listed some 38 or 40 years ago around 50, moves down to 8 and then up to 
262 and back to 22 shows what it can do: it can be very bearish, also very bullish. But a stock listed 
within the last few months or last few years do not tell you anything about its habits, it’s possibilities, 
its good and bad features. 
Why do people speak of a "trusted employee"? Only experience can show whether he can be 
trusted or not. Admitted, everyone has to start once. When we look at the "Positions open" columns of a 
newspaper we find invariably in each ad: "experienced only need apply." Some time, somehow ‘the 
somebody’ must gain experience. We must give the people a chance to work themselves up; the same 
with stocks; we must watch the new stocks very carefully and follow their performance. If they prove 
within a certain time that they act like regular fellows and do not make stunts, which are against 
common rules, then we may include gradually one or the other to our list of “tested stocks." Any stock, 
that moves for any length of time against the general trend, eliminate it irrespective of how fast it 
moves. 
Continue this line of thought; it should be worth your while. 
 
LET’S REVEAL THE TRUTH 
 
KORAN, Chpt. III: "The unbelievers will say, this is nothing but silly fables of Ancient times. And 
they will forbid others from believing therein, and they will retire afar off from it."   
PART 1 
For some time now I am working on the book, called 1001 Nights. Fortunately, evidently by 
necessity, I bought a few years ago a German edition, 4 vol, translated from original texts by Gustav 
Weil, re-edited by Ludwig Fulda, published 1914. It consists of 1600 pages. The actual translation was 
made in 1836. The translator says in his introduction that publishers like to trim old original texts to suit 
their prospective buyers.   Several translations of 1001 Nights had been made into French were so far 
away from truth and facts that it is difficult to recognize them.  Weil insisted upon the publishers to 
either print it the way the original shows or else retranslate the French edition. *(by Anton Galland) 
The second edition of 1865 whose “Introduction” is also contained in the edition on hand, we 
find opinions of various savants and historians who have made extensive studies of Arabian literature 
and of Tales of the Orient.  They claim that these tales were not produced before the 15th Century, 
which I found myself and mentioned it in the September issue.  Places and rulers are quoted which 
could not have existed prior to that time. Coffee and tobacco are mentioned in one or two stories. These 
commodities had not been introduced prior to that time. 
Coming back once more to the first foreword, the translator says: They are children's stories, 
apparently intended originally for grown-ups, wherein we seem to recognize valuable poetry but are not 
able to peel it out. The stories are usually read too early in life; the ability to grasp their deeper meaning 
was not developed as yet, and juvenile editions are abridged here and there. But, how much does he 
profit, who as a grown-up returns to these stories! He says further: "1001 Nights is a 'creation'." He is 
right in that. "It is a book not produced by one author." He is right in that. "Nobody, irrespective of the 
amount of inventive ideas he possesses could have possibly completed such work. It is such a 
monstrous work produced by many nations and people covering many centuries." 
58
Later on I shall show by translating his own words in astrological language that he has made the 
right deductions. 
He says further: ''In these Tales things happen that never have occurred anywhere," had he 
added "in this world,'' he would have hit the nail or else, he would have had to add ''except in the 
Zodiac."  Then he comes with a very good statement: "Many hundreds of years and many hundreds of 
miles lie between this world and ours." Of course, he means: between Arabia and Germany, while the 
actual meaning should be: between cosmos and our 10 ounce brain matter. He says again: "Why do we 
not feel some space between these products of past ages and countries? Why do these stories never age 
but continue like a continuous Spring?" This is splendid, but he did not know why. Because they were 
started at a moment when planetary constellations insured continued belief and continued reading of 
such stories the same way as the Bible was produced. However, he gives an answer saying "No doubt 
because it is but a coat containing no person within it." Aha.... subconsciously he struck actually at the 
root, but he did not recognize the root. "The figures which roam around in these stories which approach 
us and retreat, which act like human beings, and are taken as living beings." We shall call them planets 
for our work. "The continued events as sudden changes from good fortune into misfortune and round 
the other way of persons even the ghosts and nymphs are so varied and changed that each carries so to 
say its own face." If you ever did some work on astrology, you know that all angles formed between 
two planets act differently, in sign, in longitude, in latitude as well as in declination; therefore we may 
distinguish thousands of combinations each having its own effect upon the brains and they are all 
treated consecutively in 1001 Nights.  He goes on saying:  
"Many of the tales are not free from awkward repetitions as well as showing a broadening out 
and explaining where such seems unnecessary." In this statement the translator is all wet. These fellows 
knew astrology; they knew the difficulties of students where they might fall down tread on slippery 
ground and go wrong. They might have stumbled at these places themselves once and to make sure that 
the sense and meaning is clearly understood so that there are not to be any ifs nor when’s, they go to the 
pain to repeat, emphasize (the same you will find in the Bible, too), to broaden out and bring back 
previous statements either actually in the same words or slightly changed. But, since hardly anybody 
knows what these books are all about they try to ridicule the writers about their awkwardness in using 
the language. "We are much astonished to find amid the most gruesome and savage traits tenderness 
and sweet talk, a high moral standard between the sexes which is far above our present "proud culture."  
Explanation: Aspects are good or bad, bring love affairs and kill ruthlessly; they make money for you 
and take it away if need be. So what is there to be astonished about? "The love stories contained in 
1001 Nights belong to the loveliest literature has ever been able to produce.” This needs no further 
comment. "Within the leaves of this book world experience of innumerable generations looks at us." 
Since planetary action covers everything, everything has to be treated in the book, all possibilities. It is 
surely not a one sided scientist who knows a little about his special branch such as counting the rings of 
a couple of thousands of trees, measuring the size of the distance between these rings, up in a 
watershed, making deductions from the past years of heavy rainfalls and getting up a book later on: 
How to determine rainfalls. If these fellows would not have put their nose into all sorts of sciences to 
dig up "planetary phenomena” they never would have been able to find the laws and furthermore 
nobody could write such multicolored stories with a sense in them. We must not compare these writings 
with the modern type of music such as my radio tries to produce once in a while just before or after I 
get my market quotations each day. I bet the writers of 1001 Nights would turn around in their grave if 
they heard such tunes and mixtures. 
He says further: "The great achievements of Science during the last hundred years (written 
1836) as unbelievable as they might appear, have strangely brought forth even more desire for Tales 
and Stories of this kind. The more our power spreads on "earth," the less is left in the dark and the 
unexplored, the more victoriously our "wisdom" finds formulas and mathematical rules, the more our 
59
path travels from "facts" to "fantasy". Answer: The subconscious feeling exists everywhere that we 
don’t know the laws of motion, although these writers of 1001 Nights and the Bible just octruate the 
truth to the readers. How hard they try can only be seen when you can interpret at least something of it. 
He even answers this question rather cleverly by saying: "If we can imagine a future time, when no 
questions have to be put anymore, which would explain everything clearly, measure it, weigh it and 
number it, would then still exist a demand for Tales?" He hits the nail: In that the "Tales" give the rules 
of all motions, which can be only gotten through longitude, declination and latitude, i.e. measure, 
weight and number. 
Mythological texts are much related to the Tales. They may be Greek or Roman, German or 
Norse. All are explaining laws of planetary motion and their effect upon human beings as well as upon 
all the other things. 
I have before me "The Classic Myths" based on "Age of Fables" published in 1855.   My copy 
was printed in 1899.  The introductory part is all we want to go into here since it represents the opinion 
of the writer and we shall try to show where he is mistaken.  He says: "Myths are stories of anonymous 
origin, prevalent among "primitive" people and by them accepted as true, concerning supernatural 
beings and events, or natural beings and events influenced by supernatural agencies. 
"Fables are made by individuals; they may be told in any stage of a nation's history---by a 
Jotham when the Israelites were still under the Judges, 1200 years before Christ, or by Christ himself in 
the days of the most critical Jewish scholarship; by a Menenius when Rome was still involved in petty 
squabbles of plebeian and patricians etc. etc. 
"Fables are vessels made to order into which a lesson may be poured. Myths are born, not 
made." 
Let us explain what he said so far. Myths are cycles originating at a common center (all are 
starting at one and the same point). They exist among the original cycles and cannot be changed. By 
"not subject to change" I mean: a planet that starts at 0 Aries will never be prevented by anything to go 
around the Zodiac 360 degrees and after a predetermined period will again reach this point. Angles, 
conjunctions, direct or retrograde motion occurring during such a transit with other planets or of itself 
matters not. Thus, such a cycle is meant by a myth, while, by a Fable, we understand cycles which are 
restrained or rather incidental, such as a conjunction between Mars and Mercury which does not happen 
with every round of Mercury, but with each second round only. Therefore, when a fable explains the 
conjunction Mars to Mercury we would be wrong to expect its effect each year since it happens but 
every two years. I am speaking here of geocentric positions and not of heliocentric movements. 
Afterwards this savant comes with things that makes me boil; "Myths are the outcome of 
"naive" guesses at the truth, of mistaken and superstitious attempts to satisfy the curiosity of primitive 
and "unenlightened" people (the ones who were able to fool the millions of "enlightened ones" for the 
last 500 years), to "unveil the mysteries of existence" (here he is again 100% right), make clear the facts 
of the universe and the experience of life (100% right) and to teach the meaning and the history of 
things (100% right). These are the questions that nearly every child and every savage asks: What is the 
world, what is man? (How about the grown ups? Do they know it?) Who made them? What else did the 
maker do, and what the first men? Whence came the commodities of life? What is death and what 
becomes of us after death? The answers to such questions crystallized themselves gradually into stories 
of the creation, of the gods, and of the heroes -----forefathers of men, but magnified, because unfamiliar 
(??) mysteries (??) and remote (yes, for him). 
Old literature abounds in explanatory myths of so highly imaginative character that   "we 
moderns!!" are "tempted" to read into them meanings WHICH THEY NEVER POSSESSED. 
(Professor, this is a very good answer). For the diverse and contradictory significations that have in 
recent years been proposed for one and the same myth could not all, at any one time, have been 
entertained by the MYTH MAKERS.''  
60
"A myth, whether explanatory or aesthetic, is of unconscious growth, almost never concocted 
with a view to instruction." My answer to this statement is: A plus is a plus and a minus a minus. It is 
yes or no; no two ways about it. Writers of books for lack of knowledge have to drag on books and 
books of what other had written already, and concoct a new book for the public, although nothing new 
is in it. A planetary aspect has but one effect; the one inherent on account of its momentary longitude, 
latitude and declination; this effect is described in the myth. The writer of the myth cannot go about and 
write a big story besides to fill a volume, when all he has to say (as an example): When Venus crosses 
its Node then this and this will happen to wheat, that and that will happen to rubber or to hides. He says 
it and that ends the MYTH. In actuality I was exemplifying here a fable since it does not cover ALL 
planets, but I cannot possibly give an example of a myth, without giving out the secret of motion, which 
I found. There are enough hints herein that some may detect it. 
He says further: "The myths preserved in the literatures of many civilized nations, such as the 
Greeks, present to the imaginative (where is the imagination??!!)) and the moral senses ASPECTS OF 
FRAUGHT with contradiction. In certain myths the gods display themselves as beautiful, wise and 
beneficent beings; in others they indulge in cruel, foolish and unbeautiful practices and adventures. 
These contradictory elements have been called the reasonable and the senseless. (Any textbook on 
astrology would enlighten the Light.). 
I don't believe this writer ever read the Jewish Legends; else he would get a fit when he reads in 
Vol. I of that series that Adam and Eve after leaving Paradise met a man who left his child with them 
and because the child cried, Adam killed it, cut it up and boiled the little tyke. He ate it and when the 
man came back to take the child away again, the child's bones rattled in Adam's stomach and revealed 
his whereabouts. Some gruesome tale, but the Hebrew writer just had no other way out to explain the 
law he was treating but by making real stew of it. The Arab stories treated the explanation of the laws in 
a real nice and refined way. We all realize that a steak can be cooked tender by one and tough by 
someone else and both call themselves "cooks." 
The trump card with his explanations of myths comes here. He says: "There are several ways of 
accounting for myths. According to the theory of DETERIORATION, man, although he had in the 
beginning knowledge of common facts, pure moral and religious ideas, true poetic conceptions, has 
forgotten with the lapse of time, the significance of words, facts, men, and events, adopted corrupt 
moral and religious notions, and given license to the diseased imagining of untrue and unlovely 
conceptions.” 
We don't require to print the rest of his arguments about the theory of "Improvement" or 
"progress." What he says above is 100% correct but unfortunately he tries to apply the reverse. In our 
age we have wandered way off from the true conception, from the facts and have stepped downward, in 
reverse, away from truth; this is why we don't realize the values of these old writings however hard 
these writers have labored to pick the right moment to make the stories permanent and accessible to a 
few. They are just dumb and blind and senseless to the noble task they have performed for us. They 
have in their dumbness the nerve of ignorance to belittle them, to ridicule them, to call them savages 
and what not. If these men could get up today and look over just a hundred books I am sure 99 if not 
100 would be burned at the stake as being just ephemeral ideas, "best sellers" for a month and nothing 
thereafter. Their works of facts can be printed at any time by any printer, and he will have a permanent 
source of income; why?  Because they were able to begin them at the right moment to embody 
permanency into them. How many a business of any sort lasts more than 5 years?  Very few, since they 
were all begun at the wrong time. But who knows the right time to start something? The myths, the 
Oriental Tales, the Scriptures (those that describe cycles), can tell you if you study them long enough 
and also take the right moment to begin with such studies! 
 
61
PART II 
Since the laws of motion begin to run after me instead of me running after them, I recall that in 
the Jewish Legends there is a statement to the effect that a fellow was trying to move a mountain by 
attacking it with a shovel. The neighbors and friends inquired about his intentions and when he told 
them he was going to move that mountain they thought: that guy is nuts. However, as years went by he 
had removed quite a bit of it. The further he dug, the easier things went with him, in fact his shovel 
seemed to take gradually loads as big as a wheelbarrow would hold; suddenly, the remaining part of the 
mountain gave way all by itself, spreading and opening the vast land beyond. He had moved the 
mountain. 
Readers, I have done it and did move also that same mountain; I am on the other side of it 
already. The causes of all movements are absolutely clear to me now. But, like we find in the Scriptures 
that the Israelites had to build a Temple, so must I now take all the small particles and set them together 
into the working machinery. 
Now, since I told you this you may want to know how I removed the last half of the mountain 
which moved away as if melting. There may be some among you who would like to try just what I did. 
The laws are very hard to find and they are impossible to find for anyone who does not know the 
German language, and even this is not enough; he must understand some medieval German. This 
applies to all Scriptures including the Oriental "Maerchen'' of which I spoke in the last issue. Besides, 
he must have "tasted" a little bit of everything in the way of sciences, physics, chemistry, astronomy, 
history, biology, languages, modern and ancient, he must have gone through all possible and impossible 
systems of “astrology” such as are used by the public, he must know mathematics without taking 
recourse to "answer books." He must have gone through the mill as far as markets are concerned. 
Anyone who does not answer this description or who is not willing to study all these things first should 
abandon his efforts to solve the puzzle. Of course, eternal patience is also a requisite, since even 
"Rome" was not built in a day. A fast worker who has thoroughly digested all I have written in these 
"Previews" may accomplish the job in about ten years. It took me nearly ten years to coach myself from 
dividends and earning statements over towards the Bible; so you are saved ten years already!   
All work should be in writing, keeping notes of all thoughts and ideas as they develop so that 
the good thoughts are gradually separated from the chaff. Since we know from markets that there are 
bull movements and bear movements, we have to assume that human beings have bull movements as 
well as bear movements.  Now then, since it is difficult to distinguish when a bull movement begins in 
yourself, you simply must take a chance through trial and error to discover it. If you miss up on that 
point by a week or so you will not find the right beginning even though everything just stares into your 
face, telling you: take it. Hence, on-and-off-work on this problem would not get you far since Nature 
most likely will make you work or suggests that you work just at the time you won't find things. There 
are thousands of miners up in the Nevada hills trying for gold, but very few find a bonanza. So that 
uninterrupted hard work only will make you work "at the moment" of the right beginning to bring 
success; since points of beginning reoccur, too. Those readers who studied my "Time Factors," the 
"Astrology Lessons," or my tentative work, "Bible Lessons," have inkling as to the basic knowledge 
you have to have. Some people sent me back ''T. F.’’ telling me: it's too hard for me to understand. 
They forgot that trading in markets is the hardest thing anyone could attempt. Even for normal 
endeavors, as businessmen or tradesmen we have to study subjects like advertising methods, 
psychology of men, etc., if we want to be above the average. Many people go to special schools for 
several years just to acquire that superiority. The average man wants to go into the market as soon as he 
has some money saved up or some inheritance has put him temporarily on easy street, without the 
slightest work, having in mind to "take the gravy," but usually he doesn't get to first base. 
I shall try to bring forth gradually the reason why the various sciences must be pretty well 
mastered in order to reach the goal. Zoology, for example, you need to identify the various animals that 
62
occur throughout the Scriptures. You must know their habits else the name of an animal does not impart 
to you the hidden meaning that has some connection with the habit and action of such animal. 
Geography you need too. In 1001 Nights, you find right in the first story the mention of Asiatic places, 
which indicate the place where the story treats. In the footnote which the honorable translator has 
underneath in my volume says: "From this we can see how little geographic and historical knowledge 
the writer of these stories must have had, when he permitted a Persian ruler to be master of India and 
China.” Had he not made this statement in a footnote, I would have thought much more of him. You do 
not need the beautiful maps joined to Bibles wherein the various places of the Zodiac are put into 
Palestine, but use maps showing the world and the cities around the year 1400. But you must know in 
which country they are located and not like I remember back in 1914 when the war started that a New 
York paper put the island of Heligoland into the Pacific Ocean and it is still there as far as they are 
concerned since they never corrected that error. 
You need ancient history because most of it must be astrologically interpreted. You need 
physics to learn about motion in general, particularly the parts called mechanics and optics. Chemistry 
is important to know so that you recognize the fact that certain atoms join together and others just 
simply won’t join. Astronomical laws have to be known like ABC because on planetary motion 
everything is built. You will not be able to understand astronomy unless you know mathematics, which 
in itself contains several branches. Languages as many as possible should be mastered so that the 
relationship of the words of the various languages can be compared. Botany we must not forget either. 
There are hundreds and hundreds of trees and flowers, shrubs and perennial flowers mentioned each for 
a purpose of its own. Beware if you don't know what kind of grass barley is! 
I recall back some 28 years, when Sepp Mueller, my school chum and myself tried to master the 
shift of consonants while studying original medieval German texts. Three ancient texts have so little 
relation to the present German language that the average German cannot understand a word of the 
meaning of a sentence contained therein. We may compare this to medieval English or French, of 
which I had occasionally used certain texts already too. 
We learned that certain consonants became subject to a change within a word, so that p became 
an f, t turned into s, s turned into an r, f became a v, k became ch. This change happened around the 
year 600. This way, out of lepel became Loeffel, from water became Wasser, from laten, we obtained 
lassen, fater gave Vater, etc. 
You may ask: what has that got to do with markets? It has a very far reaching relation with 
movements of all markets, because I am going to prove in a round-about way that to figure markets we 
have to enter fields that on the surface have no connection at all. 
As stated in the last issue, the Bible, the Jewish Scriptures, the Oriental Tales and all the other 
writings of this sort are writings to explain the Laws of Motion of everything. I now discovered the 
final and biggest thing: The Oriental Tales without exceptions are a product of Southern Germany and 
"made in Germany" produced somewhere in Upper Bavaria, around Wasserburg or Wessobrunn, and 
never have seen Arabia. Yes, laugh that off! How can a man get such monstrous ideas into his mind? 
We may understand it somewhat when we know that they produce the most wonderful Cannibal 
pictures right in the heart of Los Angeles. Someone some 500 years ago had in mind to write down the 
astrological laws in a new form compared to the form they had been available so far. It had to be in an 
exotic form, in that the subject itself is exotic, esoteric, or whatever names you might want to give it. 
I have been using right along the English texts of Bibles in my research, occasionally, for 
verification I used the French or the Holland Dutch Bible; I abandoned the use of the German Bible 
several years ago since the translations were very poor. 
If I would have used the English version of 1001 Nights I would have failed utterly, but some 
three years ago I had bought at an auction the complete works of 1001 Nights, 4 vol. with some 1600 
pages written in German. I had never opened them, just put them away for “decoration” like others do. 
63
But, when I worked on the Koran of Mohammed I found so many relations and allusions to names that 
I still recalled from childhood having read about them in Oriental Tales printed for children. I took the 
volumes from the bookshelves (good thing I didn't throw them out when I left the East) and began 
reading the first story. The footnote mentioned above told me immediately: Ha, the smart ones belittle 
the old ones. In it I found the same things as Mohammed brought, only in other clothes. After going 
deeper and deeper into it, the Arabian words or rather the names used to call the figures bothered me, 
since some years ago I had taken up the study of Turkish (but then for entirely different purposes) and 
these names were not used in Turkish nor in Arabian, with but few exceptions. There was a coat again. 
I began to speak out loud the names as they are spoken and pronounced in German. I repeated them to 
sort of make them enter my ears. And--- ha, ha, ha. They were mostly German words. Can you beat 
that? Some fellow near Munich who knew the laws must have thought up the idea to make Arabian 
stories, probably knew Arabian besides or had studied Mohammed's stories in the original text, 
translated his own new stories into Arabic, "discovered" them some place as an "Arabian Original" and 
dished them out as such. This fact is so clear and true that I am much surprised German speaking 
scientists have not run onto it. Of course, such statement in fairness to the readers needs an explanation. 
I shall give you here a few examples to show it. I will not use the Bible for illustration, but when you 
realize that we have stories about the "poor" in them, it should be hint enough. 
At this point we must not forget that the Turks were rulers of the entire present Balkan states 
and even came up as far as Vienna. So they were neighbors to Germany and especially to southern 
Germany. I have consulted several sources, which deal about the origin of 1001 Nights. All of them 
have the wrong conception, sorry, but it is so. Why they can entertain their ideas simply shows that they 
don't know the meaning of these stories and take them simply as children's storybooks. However, as I 
studied them, analyzing word for word, I discovered that they couldn’t even be understood by a person, 
who does not know the German language thoroughly, and besides has studied medieval German. The 
reason is this: We have to do with actual substitute words that are purposely misspelled in German 
which give sense as used in the story. Here are a few examples: (I have to quote the German text, since 
in any other language it does not give the idea at all.) We find stories about a "Gries" which word 
means in English "an old man." The right word, which "Gries" should represent is "Kreis" spelled with 
K and not with G and this word means in English: "circle." The stories treat about Zodiacal circles and 
its divisions. Example No. 2: We find stories in which we have to do with "die Armen," in English: "the 
poor." The reading and the story deal with poor people. However, these fellows meant: "die Arme," i.e, 
"the arms" at the end of which we have the hands. Then they use a man by name of "Abi"; this simply 
means in Bavarian slang: down. So, the cycle about which he talks is a down cycle. Later on we find a 
man called "Tagleb," this simply means: Lebtag or the duration of a movement. He also has a man 
called: Mussab, "muss" means in German: it "has to" and "ab" means "down," in other words, the cycle 
must become a down cycle. Then he has, of course, the Kalif, which according to the change of 
consonants (p to f) gives us: Kalb or in English: Calf, an animal we find quoted often in Scriptures and: 
meaning just the same. 
In the stories we meet with two figures: Baba Mustafa and Abu Nuwas. Who were they? They 
were rather important men in their time, as the stories will reveal, but, we must call them “cycles" 
since: Baba Mustafa in the Bavarian dialect means: "Abi, muasstauffa" or: “when you have declined 
you must 'come up again'." In August 1939 Baba Mustafa was working hard in the stock market. 
Abu Nuwas means: "abi and neues," i.e. "down and then a new cycle." Therefore both stories 
are giving us the rules about sharp down moves and the times of recovery. They are different from the 
cycle called ''Mussab'' in which we only go down and stay down in a sidewise movement similar to the 
action of wheat in the Spring of 1936 and late Fall of 1938. 
There are two sisters quoted through out the stories: Shehersad and Dinarsad. The first is 
explaining a condition of a planet "before he sat down" and in German it should be: "sh---ehe er sass" 
64
and Dinarsad means: "die nachher sass" or in English: "the one who sat after him." 
In the story of “History of the poet with Omar” we really get the “lowdown”: It says there in the 
German text: "Weisst Du nicht, dass der Dichter Worte von Dauer und dass ihre Pfeile vergiftet sind?" 
in English: Don't you know that the poets’ words are lasting and that their arrows are poisoned? Let us 
now get the true meaning of this sentence by the right substitution of words: Poet means a writer; i.e. 
the ones who wrote the stories of 1001 Nights; "words" means “rules”; lasting means "true"; arrow 
means "the lines"; poisoned means: "false." Thus we get the true meaning of this sentence. 
Don't you know that the writers’ rules are true, but that the lines written here are false and 
substituted? 
In a story Prince Seif has a Vezier called "Fares" which is nothing but the sign of Aries, so you 
also know now what a Vazier means. 
Of course, our little "Ali Baba" is but a part of the Kalif only that the K and the F are omitted. 
Under the German word Schluessel is meant a "Schuessel"; the one is in English: "Key," while 
the other word means "a bowl." Unless you substitute constantly throughout all works "bowl" whenever 
"key" is used you do not get the correct meaning. 
The word "Ur" used so often means in German "Origin," but this is only for the innocent 
readers; they have omitted purposely the "H" since it should read: UHR or translated: clock. Which 
clock did they mean? Your kitchen clock, or the Zodiac? 
A fellow pops up in the Oriental Tales called: Hussein. Who is he? He is nothing   but: "Haus 
eins" or: the first House. 
Before I bring the copy of a footnote shown in my 1001 Nights, vol. III, page 237, I have to 
bring a few explanations so that you may recognize the absurdity of the writing or explanation the 
translator of the Arab stories gave to his readers "for better understanding."   He says: "The Indian 
Kingdom Bisnagar, on the Indian peninsula, had a very glorious period during the 15th Century and the 
princes of this state seem to have ruled nearly all of Southern India, at least the part south of the River 
Kistna. Portuguese writers call it once in a while Narsinga, which was the name of the mightiest prince 
of the country. The capitol Bisnagar was founded in the middle of the 14th Century on the border of the 
Tongbruda* by two brothers who gave it the name of Vidjaynagara whereof the name Bisnagar came 
later. The kingdom was destroyed in 1564 through coalition of the four Mohammedan Sultans of 
Vizapur, Golkonda, Ahmednagar and Berar. After a battle, in which the Indian Prince was killed, his 
capital fell into the power of the Musulmans which destroyed the entire country and divided it.” 
Let us first recall the big battle that was fought in Genesis, chapter 14 shortly after the Tower of 
Babel was built. Look therein who was who. Next, we go back to medieval German: Bisnagar means: 
"bis nachher|", or after that. Vidjayanagara a German word made to sound like Indian: Wiedernachher 
or: "again after that." The Portuguese called the place Narsinga or: nach dem singen, "after the place 
called song." We must know that only few people are adapted to sing well, the others just crow; their 
planets must have a certain position so as to impart to them that talent. This place is not "Narsinga" but 
just a little ahead of the big city mentioned above. It must also look strange that this city was created 
like the city of Rome, which "they say" was built by Romulus and Remus. Is Rome the same as 
Narsinga? Couldn't be, since one is located in India and the other in Italy. But how about if the writers 
of ancient lore made Italy and India the same place in the Zodiac for convenience sake? That there were 
just exactly four sultans dividing the country according to the footnote must appear strange, when we 
think that there are so many fours in Oriental Tales that we seemingly never know whether they mean 
East, South, West and North, or: conjunction, opposition and squares, or: Ascendant, Mid-heaven, 
Descendent and Nadir?Is Aaron of the Bible the same as Harun (Alraschid)? I did not think 
Mohammedans used Jewish first names? 
As time goes on I realize the difficulty that is facing the publisher of a magazine dealing with 
"movements." Of course, the average magazine never runs out of stuff to produce printed matter; it is 
65
different when we deal with scientific matters where the sole question arises: How can we recognize a 
plus from a minus. Because, after all, we are but interested to learn or find out "does the market move 
up or down” and when do the changes occur. So, all is centering on two small questions.  It is quite 
clear to me now that we can frame our interests into three words: "up or down?" Since in all we know 
there are small tricks behind, which, when unknown, look so intricate to the outsider that he is baffled. 
When experience gradually shows the way, things do not appear as complicated any more and after a 
while, we feel as if we had known the tricks right along.(* "Tongbruda" -  2 brothers! since "bruda" means 
brother.) 
Some of you may have read parts of the Scriptures or all of it. Some may have read now 
Oriental Tales or Fairy stories. I have now found that "each such story" is one complete course of 
astrology. So you can see that the rules can be delivered quite compactly. You have in the Oriental 
Tales three stories of the Kalenders, five stories of the Barbers; they illustrate one single law in several 
forms. The Adam and Eve story (Slavonic Text of Vitae Adae et Evae) is printed in Pseudepigrapha on 
nine pages since on the eighteen pages covering the story we have two versions printed next to each 
other on separate columns. Nine pages give in a concentrated form all the secrets of the Universe, if we 
can read it. 
Of course, to arrive at the point and to visualize that this story is one form in which Laws are 
incorporated takes time and a lot of research in works of many sorts that are not leading to the solution. 
One of the main causes of finding the direction was my love for old books. I always was interested in 
old books and must admit that I have not bought a new book for nearly twenty years, except it were 
reprints in "new cloth" of old works. I always had the feeling the people of long ago knew much more 
than we do and I am as sure as one and one is two that they really did know more than we ever will 
know, although our superior sense makes us feel so far ahead of the savages that had to be cultivated. 
Try the Oriental Tales first by guessing, gradually finding the meaning of one word, then of 
another, until your dictionary is completely covered with as many other meanings as it contains words. 
When doing research work bear in mind that the common verbs, such as read, write, say, talk, go, run, 
walk, etc., are the most difficult to get into their actual meaning. You may fare much easier locating the 
Moon and the Sun or Pharaoh or Mohammed or Ali Baba. In the last issue I gave you the possible 
movements of just one planet and said that we have six more to use. To alleviate your anxiety I just say 
that: go, walk, run, mean about the same, but he who goes is a certain planet and he who walks is 
another and he who runs is again another, so think up a few more words that express a similar motion to 
cover the renaming planets with. 
Stick to one story or version and do not jump from one into another. Work until you can't get 
any further sense out of it; then begin another, until you get into similar difficulties. Keep this up and 
rotate until you have to start again with Adam or with Sheherbad.  By the time ten years have gone by 
you should be very close to the solution of: who is Adam and Eve. You might not be able to get them to 
move around at all; they might persistently stay at one and the same place, but with a lot of imagination 
you can work wonders and suddenly Mr. Adam will walk. As soon as he does he will also speak and 
that is important. Remember that first he was clay and could not walk (it says so) and then he walked 
and talked at the same time.  Of course, "the bone" is a hard one to solve and would leave the bone till 
the very last. You might have erected your temple or your Moschee a long time already and never had a 
soul to go into it or leave it because the figures are very hard to bring to a move. Readers who have 
studied astrology may think different in that they may feel that it just implies the movement of the 
planet but it is not so. 
 
FORECASTS OF MARKETS FOR OCTOBER, 1939 
 
66
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF STOCKS: 
 
Since a war was begun in Europe on September 1st, 1939 at which point I had an important 
change of trend indicated, it may appear to the average man that my forecasts won't work any more. My 
contention is: this is not so; they will work in fairly close harmony as they did before, only the 
movements should become more intensified, sharper, more volatile in the defined time portions. 
Fortunately, I was able yet to bring in the September issue my article about "protecting Accounts," so 
that, when trouble started and you were wrongly committed you still could jump to the other side. 
As we enter the month of October, we should find ourselves at high levels again. A reaction is 
due as we enter the month; it should last to the 5th or sixth. Then we should turn about face, run up 
sharply again to new high ground, but the day after Columbus Day would lighten off again for a 
reaction to the 19th or 20th. Another spurt is indicated from then on to the 25th-26th, reacting to the 
30th of October. On this day would use weakness to buy back for a run-up into November. 
There appear to be very fine movements in a big trading range with gradually higher levels as 
objective during October. On sharp reactions or sharp run-ups followed by a sidewise movement for a 
day or two without progress, a change of trend can be expected. By this I mean the dates: October 1st to 
2nd, October 5th-6th, October 13 th-15th, October 20th-21st, October 25 th-26th, October 30th-31st.  
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON: 
 
Cotton has come back by September 6th (day of writing) towards the old top of July, making for 
a double top. As we get into October a sharp drop is shown for cotton in that in all probability a large 
surplus of cotton will be again on hand, so that I would sell out long positions at least and only buy 
back towards the end of the month. 
As far as the war is concerned I have no opinion; I consider it as a phenomenon similar to a 
drought or to a pestilence, brought about to prevent commodity prices from going to zero. Everybody 
was pondering for months already how to lift commodity prices; artificial means had very little results. 
Nature achieved it with one single stroke. 
67
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF GRAINS: 
 
The forecast for grains this month is not made the way all previous forecasts were made, but it is 
made according to the findings I have taken out from Aladdin and his lamp. This is very first attempt to 
put the work begun many years ago into practical application. I had to cling so far to rules obtained via 
ordinary astrological laws. We soon will discover how well little Allah can work for us. 
It is suggested that all readers check the performance of grains this month whether they ever 
traded in wheat or not, and compare it with the forecast given. 
The first reaction, beginning as we enter the month October 1st, should amount to about 5 ¼ c 
by October 6th; an up move is then indicated till October 19th; the number of points upward should 
amount to about 19c; an irregular lower market should then begin with big volume, just below the top 
in a 3½ - 4c range. The last day (October 24th) should bring a break through the lows and we should 
lose an extra 2c that day. The 24th should be the low, having lost altogether from the peak made 
October 19th, 1939, about 6¾ c. After that a sharp rally is shown crossing the highs of October 19th   
by ¾c, reacting 4 ¼ c by the 31st of the month. This day should be a low point.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT TAKEN FROM 1001 NIGHTS 
 
In the story of Sinbad, just where he begins to make his first trip it says: "A high rank is reached 
according to one's efforts. He who wants to climb up has to walk through many a night. He who desires 
pearls has to dive into the depth of the Sea; only then can he acquire reputation and wealth. But he who 
desires results and riches without putting all his power into operation, loses his life in wishes that never 
will be fulfilled." 
Part of the story of the blind Baba Abdallah: Abdallah, born in Bagdad, his parents died while 
he was young and left a small fortune to him. He did not waste this money like many of his age do; he 
used his efforts trying to increase it, thinking day and night on ways and means to accomplish the task. 
He became rich so that he owned 80 camels, which he rented to caravan merchants. 
One day in the midst of his fortune, wishing to become still richer than he was now, he met a 
dervish who walked towards Basrah. They talked together and had dinner. During the meal nothing of 
importance was spoken, but finally the dervish said, he knew of a place of large riches containing much 
more gold and diamonds than his 80 camels could possibly carry. He felt that the dervish wasn't fooling 
when he said it. He kissed him and said: "Good derwish, I know that you don't pay much attention to 
worldly goods; what can such knowledge do you any good? You are alone and can't take much of it; 
show me where the fortune can be found - I shall load my 80 camels and shall even make you a present 
of one camel, showing this way my appreciation, friendship and pleasure." 
This was a pretty cheap offer, but the devil of money madness had entered my heart as soon as 
the dervish spoke of the treasure, so that I even felt I had offered him too much (1 out of 80); the 79 
appeared like nothing compared to the one I offered him. The dervish didn't mind the offer. "Brother," 
he said to me very quietly, you know that the proportion of the offer is all out of gear compared to the 
service I am rendering you. I wouldn't have had to say a word about the treasure and could keep it for 
myself what I told you of my own volition; you can consider this as proof that I am willing to do you 
some good and to help you." "You say," said the derwish further, you have 80 camels. I am ready to 
bring you to the treasure house and load them with as much gold and precious stones as they can carry. 
However, when they are packed you have to give me half of your camels including their load; then we 
shall part and each one can go his way. You see this division is fair; since, when you give me 40 
camels, I procure so much money that you can buy a thousand others for it. " I couldn't deny that the 
conditions sounded reasonable. Without considering the many riches which I could take in by 
accepting, I considered the separation of half of my camels a big loss and the thought to make the 
dervish rich was not at all to my liking. In short, right in advance, I rewarded a voluntary beneficial 
offer with strange feelings before ever receiving it. There was not much time to think the situation over; 
either I had to accept the offer, else I might have felt sorry all my life to have passed up the opportunity 
to acquire a big fortune. 
Immediately I gathered all the camels and we went together. The dervish brought me to the 
place and we found much gold and precious stones. I rushed like mad at the gold heaps; the dervish, 
however, picked the precious stones, being worth much more than the gold. We loaded all and had to 
leave much behind for want of bags, and camels. Before we left the dervish went to some vase and took 
from it a small wooden box and put it in his pocket. He closed the treasure place again the way he had 
opened it and the rock appeared as be fore. We divided the camels, 40 each. I took the first 40, the 
dervish the last 40. We went back the way we came and wanted to separate, the dervish to go to Basrah 
and I to go to Bagdad. I thanked him for his favors to have just chosen me to take part in such fortune. 
After a few steps the devil entered my heart; envy took hold of me. I could not stand the loss of the 40 
camels loaded with treasures. I said to myself: "The dervish does not need all this fortune; he has this 
treasure house constantly at his disposal and can take as much as he wants to. I decided to get my 
70
camels back together with the treasures. I ran back toward him, made a sign, and he stopped. I said: 
"Brother, you are a nice fellow, used to a quiet life without worldly care and you have nothing else to 
do but serve God. You may not realize what burden you take over by going away with so many camels. 
I suggest, take but 30 of them, even this amount will cause you enough hardship." The dervish said: "I 
think you are right; you better take ten of them back." I counted the ten carefully and put them to my 
own camels. Having seen how easy it was to get ten camels away from the dervish my desire to get 
more was heightened. Instead of thanking I said: "Brother, I am worrying too much about your quiet 
mode of living that I could leave you without explaining carefully that a man not used to handling such 
big business is apt to worry. It would be much better if you would make me another gift like the one 
you just made. You see, I am not saying this to benefit myself, rather to relieve you from tremendous 
worries. Let me have ten more of your camels. I can handle 100 camels as well as one." This speech 
had its effect; now I had 60 and he had but 20 camels. I should have been satisfied by now. But I was 
like one who had dysentery; the more he drinks the more water he wants. Thus I went about to get the 
balance of the camels too. Finally I got ten and finally the last ten also. I thanked him and kissed him. 
All he said was: "Make good use of it, and remember, that God can take the fortune away as easy as he 
bestowed it on us. I must have been blind; I was not even satisfied with the 80 camels but wanted also 
the small wooden box he had picked up from the vase. I said: "I noticed you picked up a small box 
containing a salve. What did you want to do with that? It seems worthless; it is not even worthwhile to 
take that along. The salve that is in it you never will use since you, as a dervish have no use for a hair 
solve The dervish said: "Here, brother, is the salve box so that nothing is missing; I want to see you 
satisfied. If I still can do something else for you, just say so; I shall do just what you want." I took the 
box, opened it, examined the salve and said: "Since you do so much for me, won't you be kind enough 
to explain me what I shall do now with this salve?" He said: " When you put a little bit of this salve 
over your left eye, you will see all the treasures hidden in the earth; but, if you rub the salve over your 
right eye, you will become blind immediately." I wanted to experiment myself with the wonder salve; 
so I handed the dervish the salve and said: "Put it around my left eye; you know that better than I do.”  I 
hardly could wait to see the results. The effect was great: "I saw immediately immense amounts of 
treasures in houses. I had kept my right eye closed with my hand during all this time and since this 
annoyed me after a while I said to the dervish: "Smear some salve on my right eye now. " He said: "I 
shall oblige, but remember, if you do get this salve on your right eye, you will become immediately 
blind. This salve has this sort of effect and you are warned ahead of time. " I thought he was fooling me 
and that some other secret was hidden behind it and said: "Brother, you are kidding.  How could it be 
possible that the salve has two kinds of effect?" "You can believe me, since I never hold back the 
truth,” said the dervish. I did not trust the dervish. I insisted, believing that if the salve has the property 
to make me see fortunes when applied to the left eye, it might have as effect when applied to the right 
eye to make me possessor of all this vast wealth.  "After having done so much good to you, brother, I 
cannot decide to bring you ill fortune now,” said the derwish. "Remember how sad it is when one loses 
his eye sight and you would be sorry all your life." But I did not stop pestering him. Finally he applied 
the salve to the right eye - immediately I became blind I cursed the derwish;  "What you said is but too 
true.” 
Now then, you were kind to me and all, but, don't you know of a secret that would now give me back 
my eyesight? The dervish said; "I have no such salve; the only one who could help is the almighty god; 
he gave you all the wealth of which you proved unworthy; now he took it again and will hand it over to 
people who are not as unworthy as you are.” 
Try and figure this out; several readings may be necessary to grasp piece by piece; the latter part 
is very enlightening in that it means: Baba Abdallah didn't see the big burst coming such is we had in 
1929 in October. He must have bought the last moment when US Steel hit 262 1/4.

LET'S HAVE THE TRUTH 
 
PART III 
 
Thijl Uilenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak, a book dealing with conditions in Flanders around the 
years 1530-1590, is another Law Book dealing with motions of the Universe. It is called the Flemish 
Bible. Incidentally I ran across it in my library when I was looking up the Crusades of the Middle Ages 
of which there were seven, the same as there are 7 Heavens and 7 Earths according to the Scriptures. 
These Crusades “smell” very much like "Complete works of how to figure events due to come." 
Unfortunately I have no old book available, as yet, that would give the 7 Crusades in one story. The 
new works of present day historians won't help any since the wording has been changed and in the 
wording and the exact joining of thoughts only can the laws be recognized.  Anyhow, in my desperation 
to check up on the Crusades I came across a 5 volume set, "History of the City of   Frankfurt on Main. I 
saw therein that 1 Frankfort up to around 1300 was a village like Carmel, that no historic data of any 
consequence are available prior to   the year 1320; besides, there was a note saying that the people of 
that time liked to live singly and not together in cities, which accounts for the lack of cities. The 
Encyclopedia says that in the first Crusade 400,000 men, led by kings were taken down to the Holy 
Land to clean it out of Unbelievers. The Crusades were supposed to have started in 1095, when Pope 
Urban II held a council at Clermont. They are supposed to have ended with the fall of Acca in 1291, 
lasting therefore 196 years. We find Crusades made by the English King, by the French king, by the 
German king; even the Dutch king went down. Italy and Spain belonged at that time to Germany or 
Germany belonged to Spain or Italy. 
I personally believe that there never were any Crusades but the initiated used this sort of idea to 
explain their laws of motions. The same applies to the story of Thijl Uilenspiegel. It is all invention 
pure and simple as a cover for what they actually have to say--another 1001 Nights. What makes me 
feel bad now is the idea that in my school days we spent nearly a year learning all about the Crusades in 
the history class! 
 
Let us analyze Thijl Uilenspiegel roughly. He is a roamer going from place to place (in all the 
Scriptures we have them). He committed a sin and had to go to Rome to be absolved of it. Afterwards 
he comes back to Flanders and tries to rid that country of Spanish rule, of the Inquisition and of 
Catholic influence. He has a companion, Lamme, who is his double; the latter is fat, Uilenspiegel is thin 
and tall. They crack jokes everywhere. These jokes are "the laws; they believe him to be crazy; at times 
they don't know that he is fooling them right and left. In my German text is found a lot of Dutch words 
and sentences, also French and Latin, things which just cannot be translated. The writer was seemingly 
German who knew Dutch perfectly. Although using the Dutch language throughout, his mind runs in 
German and not in Dutch. One joke shows it clearly and many others too numerous to relate do the 
same.  When we read the sentence about the place where Lamme, one of the figures of the story, lives 
(vol.1, page 103 my edition), it says: "They came to the house of Lamme who lived at the Pont-des-
Arches." For the reader this should mean "Bridge of the Arcs," but in French there is no word which is 
called in singular "Arche" or in plural "Arches;" however, there is a German word pronounced the 
French way that covers the actual meaning, especially if we call the French word ''Pont'' (bridge) merely 
"the point" or "the center"......Catch on? (Please apply this also to the Ark of Noah and you'll get 
places.) So his friend Lamme, which is nothing but the "Lamb" of the Scriptures and "lame" (lahm in 
German), lives at a rather dark and strange place, especially, since in the next sentence it says: "a one-
eyed maid opened the door. "You see, in astrology all sorts of places have to be treated, explained and 
used. He actually was locating at that time the November 13th low of 1929. He knew about that low 
nearly 400 years ago. 
72
Uilenspiegel, the coal-dealer's son, without schooling, using the language as he does, fitting idea 
to idea, jumping from one top to the next bottom and to the top again, going through gardens and rivers, 
into castles and inns is following so closely the 1001 Arabian stories in action and effect that only a 
blind man fails to see this. He is always in need of an assistant, Lamme, else, he can't act right. The 
same phenomenon we find when we analyze the Scriptures. The main figures always have an assistant 
too. Moses needs Aaron etc. 
He also says (page 90 vol.1): "What is worth less than a bursted bladder? A secret given out." 
This same rule is mentioned often in the Scriptures, also the 1001 Night stories. 
As the story runs on we find a " rosary of bottles" the same as we find the ghosts in Oriental 
Tales quite often bottled up. Heavens, I am giving you hints enough now to discover the basis of 
astrological laws. I am repeating and repeating to make you see. Can't you draw some of those bottles 
and recognize them as a typical movement? Can't you see the Church now where Uilenspiegel is carried 
into and gets baptized six times; can't you see the father and the mother standing straight up in front of 
the bowl with the big hole and the mason at the ceiling who pours down the water? 
 This Uilenspiegel story being one single continued story, which contains the necessary 
astrological laws, appears to me easier to understand than all the others. It seems to be one of the most 
recent ones incorporating all the laws. There were many smart people in times past who had it over all 
of us; when they once knew the laws of Nature all they did for pastime was to think up stories and work 
into them the laws with proper substitutions. I want to retract at this time a statement made previously, 
saying that I consider it very difficult to write stories of that kind that fit the laws. I believe now it can 
be easily done when the laws are once fully known. Since he who knows will never deviate from the 
truth, he will frame his words and sentences constantly alike when ex- pressing one and the same idea. 
I now can understand much better why such lovely sweet stories could be written; all stories 
explain effects of planets. All stories begin at one and the same point and run through one complete 
cycle until it starts to repeat once more at the point of beginning. The laws applying the same way in 
each sub-cycle, it is but a matter of changing persons, surroundings, subjects; in that rivers and 
mountains men and women baths, beards, eyes and ears are available anywhere, they have no difficulty 
to use them in the stories and make things sound true and logical. 
It appears to me as if 1001 Nights and Thijl Uilenspiegel are easy Grammars to work into the 
subject. The Ta1mud is the book of Syntax, the correct book of exact rules and of its exceptions. The 
pseudepigraphic works are essays of various sorts and the Scriptures are the regular, approved 
handbooks. 
I wish to mention in reference to 1001 Nights, that the 4th vol. of my edition must have been 
written by entirely different persons than the first three volumes. The arrangement of thoughts, the 
expressions are completely different than in the former portions. The same I noticed several years ago 
in the Bible; I could follow the drift of things fairly well then until I reached the Kings; of Jeremiah I 
could not translate one word. These parts must have been written by entirely different people whose 
thoughts did not react on my own astral body favorably. 
Thijl Uilenspiegel is actually a Dutch or Flemish work and if you should try to study it, obtain a 
Dutch dictionary for examination of words given in original Dutch, which cannot be given in another 
language. Since Dutch was one of my first languages to master, I had no difficulty to pick up quickly 
the underlying idea of given Dutch words---as stated long ago, it is all a matter of substitution, not only 
in ideas such as "father" being equal to "courage, " but in the shading of the words itself. For example I 
may say: "the sap begins its flow at the root of the tree; however, the saps in the stock market begin to 
buy at the top of the tree. " Changing this for i1lustration' s sake, I may say: "Saps begin to flow on both 
ends of the nut tree." If you would find such a sentence in a story you would quickly say: "there is a 
mistake somewhere," and keep on reading your story as long as the story continues giving a fair sense. 
But, a lot of valuable information is contained in this apparently twisted sentence. 
73
All the works treated right along are made up of sentences and substitutes like the one modeled 
above as an illustration for you. 
I have not read an English version of Thijl Uilenspiegel. If you do hunt for one, take a complete 
edition and use an original issue. It may be printed years ago or it may be a recent reprint of an old text, 
as long as it is a good translation. No use expecting you to learn now quickly Holland Dutch, since last 
month you might have started on medieval German. By this sentence I just wish to bring forth the idea 
what fields have to be entered and entered in a hurry, getting away from thoughts of India and Mecca 
and walk along with Uilenspiegel through Flemish villages and live with thoughts and ideas of the 
Flemish people which fortunately I had done many years ago. 
This is as far as I can go, else "the bladder might burst" I have given you in these six issues 
enough material on hand to continue. Bible, 1001 Nights, Thijl Uilenspiegel, and other subjects 
pertaining to show the way to truth are not going to be touched any more from now on. This is the end 
and it is 72 pages, the same as Time Factors" had 72 pages without knowing at that time the reason why 
it required 72 pages. I do now. 
To clear out the remnants of "Time Factors," 7 Lessons in Astrology, and of "Bible Lessons," 
they'll go for the next 30 days for $5.00 a copy; if they don't go, they'll go to the Pont-des-Arches to 
Lamme. None will be available after that time. 
No renewal for expired subscriptions to Preview is solicited nor accepted. 
 
WE LIVE IN A FUNNY WORLD 
 
In the September issue I said something about people trying to be more than they really are (girl 
with polished nails, applicant applying for a. job). 
We have many other cases where this is shown well. 
Take the moving pictures. Pictures of royal scenes, of cannibal life made right in the heart of 
Los Angeles, Calif., make the movie fans weep for joy, cry for pity about the man who is in danger. 
They are carried in their minds way off from their own trodden path, from their normal planetary 
movement into a planetary movement which is not their own, but which belongs to somebody else. 
Theatres are the same type of make belief. Once I went to see Aida in the New York 
Hippodrome. This is what I lived through. First of all, Aida being an Egyptian piece does not very well 
fit into our present life. So while going over to see it I made up my mind to think strictly of pyramids, 
ancient Pharaohs, mummies, tombs, etc. When the curtain rose I saw an "Egyptian Room" whose walls 
were of painted cloth, the wind from back stage blew the walls and sort of "inflated" them on and off, 
things did not fit any more, the figures playing tried their best to keep their Egyptian physiognomies, 
but when the first act was over I had enough. The "Make-belief" was not even able to "make-me-
belief." 
When in 1930 and 1931 we found ourselves in a major bear market, one of the New York 
newspapers started a make believe campaign by printing underneath each article the following verse: 
"Buy now." "Buy now," suggesting to the readers to take advantage of the present prices and buy 
because things are cheap. They were rather high then, since we dropped headlong into an abyss. When 
the abyss was reached strange to say, I do not recall that this slogan was printed any more then, because 
at that time people had spent their money already. They tried their best to stem the tide, but why it 
didn't work we know. The time was not ready. 
Trips and travels are another sort of "make belief."   When in the summer we get away from 
business, we enter temporarily a new world, we "see things" that actually do not belong to "our" world.  
 
74
We see strange, exotic people, strange habits methods of doing things, which do not at all agree 
with our own ideas since they belong to some other world (each nation or country we may consider as a 
world of its own). 
When we get back we feel some sort of relief to be back "home," i.e. in our own world. 
Everything looks so "real" at home so actual and known that we are glad to be once more "in our own 
cycle." 
In Germany, I recall, the boys after having gone through school take up trade, pay a goodly sum 
to be allowed to work there for three years as an apprentice. After those three years have passed, they 
become what is called a "Geselle" or one who should know the rudiments of the trade. Immediately 
thereafter these young men take the road, traveling through the country, working here and there to make 
a living. In doing so they gain experience of all sorts, how things of this trade are done here and there. 
Some may stay at a place and settle; most of them however after a year or two find their way back 
"home" to stay and establish themselves in business. The events that happen to them during this 
traveling are talked about all their life when they sit together. Some add to the stories, others omit 
certain unpleasant experiences, but they live through everything a hundred times. It is their world of 
"make-belief." 
One very interesting case illustrating the gradual increase of "make belief" a person, or persons 
are subject to, which, in due time they even take as actuality or as an actual fact is this one:  
Many years ago I lived in a western city. Friends lived down the block. One evening, around 6 
p.m., I went over to them to take home my wife whom I thought was visiting there. Coming up the 
stairs I knocked at the door (it was an apartment house). The friend's wife answered, "Who is there?", 
an expression I never liked to hear but which I heard there so often. That was enough. I knew if my 
wife had been there she just simply would have opened the door to look who was there. Anyhow, I 
quietly retreated and went home. My wife had been visiting some other friends and had reached home 
in the meantime. 
Now here comes the "make belief." The lady, a normal, intelligent and refined type told her 
husband that evening that some man came to the door and tried to get into her apartment. He 
immediately got his gun ready, loaded it, so that, if need be, she could shoot it out with the intruder. He 
told me all about the event the next morning but I "acted" (seemingly for your benefit now to illustrate 
something of great importance 25 years later) as surprised inquiring about the facts of how this 
happened. That lady saw how her husband loaded the gun and gradually picked up courage, pictured 
herself holding that gun and shooting at the intruder "were he to come again." 
So, that evening I went over to them, heard the story "first hand" from the lady. The story had 
already become bigger than the one I heard from her husband. The door was pushed hard, the fellow 
outside demanded that she open the door and that she was going to call the police etc., etc. 
Years went by and I never revealed to them that innocently I had come to the door to look for 
my wife. I had not said a word; else she would have recognized my voice. On and off I saw them and 
when the moment was opportune, I asked her to tell me the story of the burglar, as she termed the caller 
for quite some time. The event was always more and more enlarged; she finally, two years ago, when I 
happened to visit again, said: she had to pull the trigger and he was wounded but made a get-away even 
at that. 
Last year I saw her again and had her tell the story. But it grew so big and she pictured herself 
as such a big heroine that I had to stop it and said "Clara, dear, it was me and you didn't know that for 
fully twenty-five years. 
There are many traders in stocks or commodities who watch a certain stock. It may be a cub. 
They like it, watch it, but don't buy it; they have the feeling it is a good stock; but this is as far as they 
go. This cub grows in price and they see it grow, but wouldn't buy it since it "might have a reaction." 
Finally the stock or the price of that commodity becomes a monster. It is then so big that they say: Now 
75
I have to take you and they buy it right there when it has outgrown itself, i.e. when it is on the top. The 
stock is so lively and vivid, so active and lovely that they hug it and pet it, tell others about it until--- 
Nature says: Clara it was but me, or, in other words, the Time cycle of inflating is over; the stock grows 
"thin," it reacts on small volume and before they realize, it is a cub again, even less than a cub--- the 
water is taken out of it, the skeleton is left, the bare value. The trader may say to the stock: How nice 
and fat you were, but how thin are you now! Remember the story of Red Riding Hood and the Witch.  
In this last sentence is hidden an important secret about planetary motion. Think about the fat and lean 
years of Egypt while you are at it! 
 
WORTH KNOWING 
 
There is a rule with a certain broker (it may be a general rule of the Chicago Board of Trade) 
that if you buy single lots of wheat, you have to sell them singly and not as full contracts. Supposing 
you buy two lots today and three lots tomorrow (one lot is 1000 bushels), you cannot sell them as a full 
contract, although a full contract constitutes 5000 bushels. This is what happened to a trader (B.G.) who 
never toughed anything else but wheat up to the time where the case happened. After suggesting to him 
about eight weeks ago to buy some cotton, he calls up his broker, to buy five lots of cotton. 
Unfortunately his regular customers' man was not there when the call came in, the one next to him took 
the order without bothering about the size of his account which runs around $1200.00. This man rushed 
over to place the order, it was executed and everything was hunky-dory until the next morning the 
uninitiated cotton trader got a margin call for $1700.00.  Cotton unfortunately sold off some ten points 
during that day and he had bought five full contracts of that cotton, since there are no single lots of 
cotton traded. The margin required for this amount was $2500.00 and, since cotton did sell off ten 
points besides, the margin clerk felt like he should rub it in good and well to him for having the nerve to 
buy that much cotton with such little margin. 
This was an accident and not one of the so-called "chance plays" when you can once in a while 
get the best of the margin clerk for a few hours. 
Watch what you buy and know what the trading units are. 
 
CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM RESEARCH MADE 
DURING THE SUMMER OF 1939 
 
1. The movements of markets are subject to planetary motions only, so that propaganda, one way 
or the other, restrictions one way or the other, wars, droughts, pestilence which, in themselves 
are nothing but the effects of planetary motions, wheels within wheels, influence markets only 
the way Nature requires it. 
2. We, ourselves have nothing to say about it. 
3. Our lives are but one card of a serves of many decks. 
4. Motions cannot be controlled, but they can be figured the way they are due to come and to 
develop. 
5. The laws of how to figure movements of any particular think alive, are contained in hundreds of 
ancient works, such as the Bible, the Myths, the Fabled 1001 Nights, Decameron, the Egyptian 
"Book of the Dead," the Talmud and Al Koran. 
6. The way these books have been worked up they appear as innocent so called religious books. It 
76
is said they are "open books" and therefore they can be understood if one takes off the veil. 
7. My conclusion from the research made so far points toward the following: All these works were 
"Made in Ger many" between the years 800 and 1 500 or even a little later. The fundamental 
laws might have been known by ancient nations possibly 1000 or more years be fore, but only at 
the above given period have they been put into story forms. 
8. Common methods of astrology never get anyone towards the solution. Ali Baba says in the story 
of the 40 Thieves: "Their (the traders) methods were used to make profits, but for such 
undertakings (of solving the puzzle of motion), one has to approach it in a clever and strange 
way. 
9. Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves is the complete work of: How to figure wheat movements. At the 
end of the story he says: "(Since he now understands the rules, what the actual meaning of each 
word should be, what planets are meant, what type of motion is used, how the movement occurs 
in the Zodiac, where the actual beginning of a cycle starts and when it HAS to repeat, etc.) Now 
he doubted no more that he was the only one in the world who knew the secret of how to open 
the Cavern so that the entire treasures contained   therein were completely at his disposal." This 
is quite a broad statement to make. But I can see it that way myself. The whole story comprises 
but 28 pages and contains under cover all that is to be known about wheat prices for any time, 
any year, any month or day, clearly though concisely written. 
10. The idea of substituting words for other words so as to cover up the actual meaning sounds 
strange to the average man. However, it must have been the greatest art with these writers, much 
greater than the actual finding of the laws. Because, when you realize it is but the question of 
simple line' s movement and they were able to write a wonderful story about it that makes you 
feel like being in Fairy Land, such work is marvelous. 
11.  On the other hand, the way some people feed the public these stories and the way the public 
does take them is just as marvelous and unbelievable. The joke of it all is that neither of the 
parties knows what it is all about, and they never will know nor even try to know. We just find 
in this condition another law of the Universe. 
12. When you read over the various articles produced in these six volumes of Preview, you will 
notice that we covered an immense field. Most of it had to do with hidden secrets, where and 
how to get a hold of them, how to tackle them patiently and persistently. We have not touched 
on dividends, nor on car-loadings; we have not bothered about the electric out-put for the month 
nor about the rain of yesterday in the Middle West. We just simply have ignored 
EVERYTHING upon which the average trader pins his deductions and his hopes of arriving at 
the conclusion: is the market a buy or a sale. If these writings have brought you only as far as to 
say: the common approaches of traders to judge markets are valueless or very nearly so, then 
your investment shows big profits already. That the common way is more believable hitches on 
the same laws as I give in point 11 above and therefore don't need repetition. 
13. The writers of our texts MUST HAVE worked with charts, not only with one chart that of 
planetary motions but with actual charts of the daily high and low prices of commodities. This is 
clearly indicated and visible. They knew all about gaps up-gaps and down, gaps. They even tell 
how to determine the time when they are due to come. On page 24 I explained all about 
commodity charts. 
14. The number of twisted German words mentioned in last month's issue have increased greatly 
during my research this past month; my reductions have proved absolutely correct since they fit 
each place wherever they repeat in stories whether in 1001 Nights, Bible or Midrash, and 
ALWAYS mean the same thing. Having just now the book of 1001 Nights before me, I notice 
without searching for a special case right on the opened page, vol. III, 225: The story of Ali 
Baba and the 40 Thieves ends when the captain of the Thieves takes the name of: Chogia 
77
Husein. This "Husein" I said in the last issues, means: "Haus eins" or: "House No. 1." The story 
that follows is entitled: "History of Ali Chodjah, Merchant of Bagdad." Here we find "Chogia," 
the captain of the Thieves with another name, i.e.,"Chodjah." (LAUTVERSGHIEBUNG change 
of consonants.) Therefore, it is but another name covering the previous one. And there are 
people in this world who think them to be silly fables of the Orient.. The Mohamedanization of 
the Bavarian dialect words or of medieval German words is another art these writers understood. 
What fun they must have had when they wrote the stories for future students. They might have 
often said ''Now, let's see, how shall we say now: go and find a name for that aspect, go and find 
a city for this top; but don't go all over creation for it take one that SOUNDS believable for the 
masses.. Another one might have said; Let us call profit "salt" which I found to mean just that. 
The translator of 1001 Nights from Arabian back into the original tongue, from which it grew, 
says in a footnote, vol. III, page 221: "Salt indicated by the ancients the symbol of friendship 
and trust (he hits that pretty well); they used it in all their offering and alliances.(Not bad ). 
Beduins and Arabs of the desert considered it the symbol of trust and indicating the inviolance 
of their treaties. They had greater respect of nothing but of bread and salt. If they once have 
eaten with a man (Can you see now what is meant by man?) bread and salt, it would be a terrible 
crime to rob him or his baggage or merchandise, etc. (He brings another 20 lines of his thoughts 
to explain away the fact that salt in the Scriptures simply does mean everything but "profit." Let 
him be happy with his ideas, but we use ours, which is the true meaning. 
15. It seems to me as if the Scriptures and similar writing never had been intended for the public; 
they were not meant to be "Sacred Writings" but "Secret Writings." They may be termed "Code 
messages" for a few, and "Code messages" for all the rest. A Code message is decipherable for a 
few; undecipherable for all the others and for both it is a Code Message. 
16. I know there are some readers who are going to follow carefully all the suggestions made in 
these articles both for training and for personal research. I also feel sure that in this present era 
planetary positions are such that one or the other of the many readers will find the true 
beginning and build on it. Fade-outs will occur frequently; but one of these fade-outs new 
phoenix-like ideas will come forth until such time as the correct substitutions have been found. 
Then everything will click from Adam over to Amen. 
 
SPEND YOUR OWN MONEY 
 
Something happened today in Salinas, Calif., where I went with the boss, to buy a school dress, 
for the girl. The purpose of making an example of this common procedure is to convey to you certain 
ideas that may be helpful in trading or in life generally. 
A lot of my readers who know us from New York or those who have passed a few hours with us 
while traveling through here this summer re call that my boss is very picky, exact and careful. It is hard 
to put one over on her. I recognized this fact long ago. Anyhow, we went to a store to buy a dress. She 
had apparently figured out for a week already which kind she wanted, the price she was ready to pay, 
the color, the style, the fabric and whatever things must be considered when one wants a certain dress. 
She went to that department, went right to the individual sections to select roughly the color of the 
dress, rejecting of the first batch most of them except one which she took off, looked at it and placed it 
back. Then she went to the second batch, glanced at them, touched a few, picked two and laid them 
aside. Then she went to the sweater section in that something must have come into her mind that 
sweaters might be more appropriate. At the place she had been standing she could not see the sweater 
section since it was in the far corner. She left everything and looked over some ten or twelve sweaters 
78
and I got sick and tired from looking and went down to the car to work on my Ali Baba, which for 
safety's sake I had taken along. I was so engrossed in my work that I did not notice that two hours had 
gone by at the time she came and all she had bought was six stencils, which I need to make letters. The 
sales girls (customers' men) who were after her to suggest this and that, to praise this design and that 
color retired in disgust because she just said "I am just looking." They were not leaders at all, since they 
could not in duce her to buy what they wanted to sell her, but she kept her own way about it and did not 
buy since nothing to her liking was available. She has her will because she knows just what she wants 
and would not take "similar" for it. So she rather does without it. 
When trading, you must act the same way. You must make up your mind way ahead that you 
want this stock or wheat or rubber about a certain time, when according to your mind the price is right. 
Supposing you are waiting for U. S. Steel to reach a certain price and you go to the broker to buy it; 
don't let him sell you some other stock instead. If you can't get U. S. Steel and get it at the price you felt 
was the right price, go home and do without it! This is such an important rule that I had to bring it in 
picture form (like an Oriental Tale). The entire story could have been said in a few words: Spend your 
own money. Most people use sales people to have them spend their money. A salesman who gets a hold 
of a "good prospect"(my boss is a very poor prospect) can sell him everything under the sun, just like 
some people sell astrological books and call them Oriental Tales.

FORECAST MARKET MOVEMENTS FOR NOVEMBER 
 
WHAT STOCKS SHOULD DO:   
The strength displayed in stocks during October should still be present as we enter the month. 
Let us expect a continuation of the strength at least up to Election Day, to be more explicit, until 
November 7th. From that time I expect a sharp reaction to develop in stocks. It should not be the 
beginning of a bear market but rather be an expression of thoughts about the results of the elections. 
Temporary profits should therefore be accepted Election Day with a view to replace the positions 
between November 15th and 20th for another spurt upward. Fast traders may want to lighten once more 
on the old Thanks giving date and wait with buying stocks back until we have entered the month of 
December. By Thanks giving we most likely have regained a little more than half the losses sustained 
from the E1ection results. 
In that there will be no more issues of Preview, readers whose subscriptions expire with this 
issue are invited to take a subscription to my weekly analysis and, as far as I can judge, it will be well 
worth the little extra expense; others, whose subscriptions have to run another six months, will be 
properly taken care of either by direct refund, if desired, or by a suitable forecast on the 20th of the 
month similar to those contained herein but without articles. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
The forecast of wheat for the month of November is again made with the new method, this time 
I use Ali Baba and his forty Thieves. According to my interpretation "thieves" means profit hunters. 
Their captain means "the trader"; this month they should be out for a lot of thievery and they should say 
on November 11th to12th: "Sesame (wheat), open the doors," because I expect a gap upward at that 
time and a run to produce profits the balance of the month. A small reaction is shown from November 
and down to the 5th or 6th, followed by a slow comeback, whereby it should appear as if the bottom 
might drop out most any moment, but then instead of a drop we should be due for the gap and the run. 
The up move should continue until the end of the month at which time would take in the sails 
temporarily for rather wide fluctuations sidewise are indicated to lead us into the month of December. 
But, the last week of November should not yet become the high point for wheat and it should be 
taken as a period of temporary profit taking by some of the "thieves" the way Ali Baba calls the bull 
traders. 
Be it said yet, that the stories I am speaking of constantly are giving only important movements 
and not one has pointed as yet to divulge small "jiggles.

So why should we attempt to even think of trading for day-to-day movements and of methods 
"to get wiped out in a hurry"?  
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF COTTON.
Cotton has followed the forecast for October but in such a narrow range that it is hardly 
noticeable as yet (Oct.11th). The month of November indicates a rise for the first ten days and a 
reaction back to about the same levels as when the month begins. However, like with stocks, the price 
of cotton has moved up slowly though steadily so far this year. The stick upward made on Sept. 10th, 
1939, and the subsequent gap down the day after (Sept. 11th, 1939) indicates from chart reading to me 
that we should play in this zone for a while, precluding thus a drop below the Sept. 1st level as well as a 
passing of the 10c level in most options; I rather would consider cotton as moving in a big trading range 
of two hundred points: 8.00 - 10.00 with an intermediate resistance at the 8.70 level (NY cotton and 
December option is used). Action should be taken at either end for the contrary side and a gap, which 
could develop on the road, can be followed immediately to the zones of resistance indicated just now. I 
consider cotton moderately bullish.

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION IN THE INTEREST OF 
STOCKS AND COMMODITY TRADERS. 
 
All statements made in this publication are George Bayer’s personal opinion.  They are based upon 
apparent recurring cycles of time and price.  The forecasts given herein, while made with the utmost 
care, are not guaranteed. 
 
HAPPINESS, HEALTH AND MONEY 
 
I have noticed in some magazines that they give the "reading time" for various stories they 
bring. I shall give you here also the "reading time" for this special article so that you can benefit 
accordingly: Please take two quiet hours for the first readings one and one-half hours for the second 
reading the day after (allowing 24 hours for thoughts). A week later read it just once more. 
The well being of people is shown in three ways, through happiness, or satisfaction, through 
health and through money. They are three separate entitles the same as longitude, declination and 
latitude are in space. 
We can lead a very nice and useful life when one of these three apparent essentials is weak so to 
say; we may have lots of money and good health but little happiness with it; we may have happiness 
and plenty of health such as most hoboes possess, but be without funds; we also find cases where there 
is plenty of money, as well as happiness, but poor health. 
In mathematics we distinguish height, width and breadth. In bodies many times one of these 
essential parts is completely weak. Things might have height but very little of the other "virtues" as 
exemplified by a needle. A thing might have width but hardly any height or breadth, such as is the case 
with the leaves of the deciduous trees. The idea astrologically is simply this: Nature just could not have 
a leaf of a plane tree an inch thick, nor could the tailor use spikes to sew clothes.  In other words, to 
illustrate the idea better, unless a thing (anything) has a certain longitude, latitude and declination, it 
would not be that thing at all If the fixed star Sirius would not remain in its latitude and right ascension 
it would not be the fixed star Sirius any more. The same way when Venus rises in the morning before 
the Sun we call it the "Morning Star'', but, after a while when it contacts the Sun, we discard this name. 
Venus then has no name for people since it can't be seen except for the few who need this planet 
constantly to figure out market movements. After a few months people recognize Venus again in the 
sky but call it now the "Evening Scar" since it sets later than the Sun. We note therefore three "phases" 
for Venus as observed by people in general. The effect of Venus upon the market in each of these three 
phases is so different that it will surprise you. When a planet is near the Sun we say: ''it is burnt by the 
Sun." This is a rather clever saying. At that time the Sun is so powerful in respect to the planet Venus 
that it seemingly does away with Venus and Venus is not Venus anymore, but becomes a part of the 
Sun. You must have noticed many times, when the weather changes the Moon has a halo. The Sun also 
has one although not visible to us; the study of the effects of planets upon human beings and upon 
markets will reveal this halo of the Sun. At the time a planet is within its halo I found that such a planet 
is useless and has little or no effect; but on either side beyond the halo, it again has its effect upon 
human beings as well as on stocks or commodities that it is present. The halo of the Sun is measured in 
degrees, so many degrees each side of the Sun (about 100). See Illustration No. 10, Page 74. 
Let us now call for illustration's sake that Venus as morning star represents Happiness, let us 
assume further that when within the halo or orb of the Sun it represents Health and as evening star it 
represents Money. In this assumption happiness does not very well join up with money since they are at 
opposite ends of the Sun, but health joins both since it is found to be in the middle, within the halo. 
Were it not for the constant oscillation of the planets towards the Sun and away from the Sun, 
the individuals living on this earth would have absolutely no hope of ever being  
84
Extreme elongation of Venus from the Sun is about 480
subject to a change. But, thanks to Nature, for a while, Venus is the morning star and for another while 
it is seemingly nobody and again for a little while it is the evening star. 
This condition alone would make things still not very oscillative unless the various beings were 
not born at all sorts of moments. Some are born when Venus is the evening star, others when Venus is 
in the Sun and again others when Venus is the morning star. Those people or stocks born when Venus 
is morning star (excluding for the time being that the other 6 planets are also affecting us in a similar 
way) will act alike and will be attracted to each other. They are chips of the same block. Births in 
contrary sectors will act contrary upon each other. With this idea we can explain somewhat that a trader 
buys a stock and as soon as he has done so it moves down on him; he just has bought an "enemy”. I am 
speaking of “births only" at this moment. Therefore an enemy by birth will be a permanent enemy. To 
illustrate this better let us say: a person born with Venus as Evening star who buys a stock or 
commodity born at the time Venus was morning star is buying an enemy.  All he can expect of such a 
trade would be the wish that his Venus had plenty of longitude to feed the contrary position with 
money. We have necessarily "half-enemies" which would represent the adjoining position, i.e. the halo 
or middle position, compared to either outside (as morning or evening Venus.) An evening star trader 
buying a stock born in the halo has to take occasionally small losses in such trade although they are not 
as disastrous as those taken in morning star stocks. Only when a trader is fortunate enough to pick a 
stock or commodity of his own birth will he be able to make money. This is my personal opinion. To do 
so, he either figures it out or else he finds it out through experience. In "Time Factors" I stated several 
years ago: when you take a severe loss in a stock never try to get even with that stock. You surely will 
take another trimming. Now then we have an extra minus and one small minus against one plus; this 
gives the overweight to the minus side. It does so for the average trader. It accounts for the constant 
change of "Traders Material" if I may, for emphasis sake use this expression. The average trader who 
frequents brokers offices lasts about a year under normal conditions before he has to quit. What about 
your self? Ah, this is where you differ and rightly so.  
85
The first virtue you possess, above all other traders is your attempt to learn how to overcome 
obstacles or deficiencies. This is why you subscribe to “Preview”. If you have any traders’ friends at 
heart, you should tell and explain to them about my work. They just don't know of it. You have 
realized, probably long ago, that business rules cannot be used as stock market rules. General learning 
such as Law, Medicine Art, etc. does not help in the least. It may hurt some readers, when I say; my 
experience with traders these many years has shown me that the poorest traders are doctors and 
lawyers. They are the greatest plungers I have ever known. It must have something to do with their 
profession, where, after a consultation the watchword is: we have to win the Case or, we have to 
operate successfully and, if things do not come out the way it had been planned......They lack the ability 
to stop in the middle of a case or of an operation (I mean a trade in the market) when they notice that 
the commitment is wrong. They just wouldn't jump out when losses pile up, but they have decided right 
at the time of the commitment to see it through to a profit. Let me say to them: the patient or client in 
their case is the stock, which is traded. If "he" is sick don't try to cure him by supporting him. 
The mental condition of lawyers and doctors is always bullish, they want to win every case, and 
they want to perform every operation successfully. This thought, in stock market terms, is expressed by 
BUYING; they actually would not accept the idea of "losing a case," or a patient dying on them: Such 
thought expressed in market terms would be SELLING. Thus they never think of markets that go down. 
In the event they happen to strike a movement right very seldom do they take profits or normal profits? 
Not taking profits is bad policy in the market; taking losses is often times a virtue as long as they are 
small. 
The second "virtue" you possess is your belief that planetary forces govern movement of stocks 
and commodities.  We know that astronomers figure out the exact positions of these planets from day to 
day and their individual motions. They are not concerned with the effect of these planets upon human 
beings or upon stocks and commodities. In fact, I have never seen an astronomy book, which would not 
contain a chapter saying in essence that people who believe stars and planets can affect us just "have a 
screw lose". If we would not believe this, and even prove it, should we want to, we could revert back to 
earning reports and other statistics so as to buy when earnings are at the peak and sell stocks when the 
corporations pass the dividends, because their earnings have dropped so low that the red appears. As far 
as proving that planetary movements affect human beings into buying and selling stocks or 
commodities, we just take an ordinary Table of planets motions and scan some of the Eclipses formed 
by Sun and Moon and look at the effect:

Enumerating these eclipses I have for lack of space passed up the years 1934 and 1935. I also 
ignored the Eclipses with the Moon. There are usually two Sun Eclipses a year. If two eclipses of the 
Sun occurring in one year bring two major changes in stocks or commodities can we find a rule in this 
or shall we just say: It is a coincidence? Of course, astronomers, in their exact work would want the 
effects to be: the moment an eclipse occurs, that very moment every trader should change his mind. 
We, however, are satisfied with but the halo of the eclipse since we have in our arm sleeves a whole lot 
of other astronomical phenomena that assist us in recognizing the approach of a change of trend. 
Note from the example of eclipses, at times the mind of stock traders is affected, at other times 
the mind of wheat traders and again at other times the minds of both types of traders undergoes a 
change. This does not matter as long as people change their minds. To define when one happens and 
not the other would be going into the finer points of the work of research. All we want to do just now is 
to show that eclipses bring about a change of mind among the traders toward wanting or not wanting 
stocks or commodities. 
A few years ago I read an article wherein some professor had been checking up on people or 
firms that make forecasts on market movements. He did not stipulate whether such forecasts had been 
made with the aid of planetary movements or whether they were made up from statistics and "outlook". 
It could not have very well been the former since you can count planetary forecasters on your 
fingertips, while the other type seems to bloom rampantly. He found that in the course of several years 
they were 40% right in their expectations. As stated quite frequently, my forecasts for minor 
movements over many years have not been always right, but they were very right for major movements.   
When the forecast was wrong, it was so but temporarily. For example, in the June move of 1939, my 
forecast was all wet, and I have never tried to paint it any other way, but let us look at the actual facts. 
We had bought wheat in March and early April 1939, stressing the idea that wheat according to the gold 
standard was actually back at the 40c level, which was the bear market low price in 1932. According to 
my article about pyramiding (page 21) we had to make the major commitment at or near the low, 
decreasing the amount of additional purchases as we moved higher. The fact, as admitted by clients, 
was this: many clients did not buy or else they bought very little around the mid-March and early April 
1939 low. They said: We will watch it. Then the up move developed suddenly so fast that before they 
knew of it the price was above 76c, an advance of some 15c. When they saw wheat at such levels things 
looked good to them and, unfortunately the corner of June 1st, 1939 actually became a top instead of a 
gap upward. Thus the forecast strengthened their courage. Anyhow, many bought only close to the top. 
When things turned downward I said in my weekly analysis: I would hold on to wheat now since most 
of it had been bought around the low (assuming this) and the amount bought at high levels just had to 
be carried down once more, since, in my years of experience I knew that the price of wheat normally is 
not 60c but above $1.00 and, when the trend does reverse, it will make a fast move. This it did. He who 
bought in March or early April never even got into red except a few cents in the Winnipeg market, but 
no trouble was experienced in Chicago at all. He who pyramided wheat last spring according to rules 
explained on page 21 could not have come into any difficulties in spite of my erroneous interpretation 
of the aspect of June 1, 1939. This summer's work has made me find the cause of the error I add now. 
87
At any time a condition similar to last May occurs again, we shall not miss the direction. I found it 
listed as an extraordinary case in 1001 Nights. 
Let me bring a small list of tops and bottoms that had been located in my work of forecasting 
(old clients can verify this): the top of 1929; the exact day of the bear market low, June 2nd, 1932; the 
bottom of March 1933; the exact day of the top of July 7th, 1933 (it was the rail top); the low of 
October 1933; the top of April 21st, 1934; the exact day of the low of Sept. 17, 1934; the March 8th 
high of 1937 for stocks and the Thanksgiving low of 1937; the 156 level as top in November, 1938 and 
the January, 28th low of 1939. All these dates were not forecast a week or so before they occurred by 
accidentally defining such day top or bottom within a movement, but the June, 1932 bottom was 
forecast a1ready in January, 1932 as the major low of the bear market; the July 7th top, 1933 was 
forecast actually during the banking crisis, 1933. The April top in 1934 was forecast when the October 
21st low 1933 had been made. The subsequent years forecast dates you can find in magazine articles as 
having been forecast a long time before they were due to appear. The top for the present movement up- 
wards I have for February 5th, 1940. 
This work of forecasting, has been done only by using planetary movements, and nothing else. 
When I look back over the years I can see with what primitive methods I started in. At the present stage 
of my knowledge I hardly can believe that the forecasts could have turned out so well and to the point. 
It goes to show that any average person, with a desire to learn forecasting trends can acquire this 
knowledge. The idea is but to get the right point of beginning. The trouble with most traders is that they 
think some black magic has to be used for it. No doubt, there is a lot of work connected when trying to 
forecast movements of individual stocks, since each one has its own habit. To forecast the general stock 
trend and to learn how to do it is fairly easy. I do not use a regiment of statisticians, nor do I have a lot 
of stock chants by the day, week or month the way Hotel rates run, but a simple line is all that is used. 
There is another thought coming to me right here concerning the professor who checked on the 
Forecasters. To criticize something is much easier than to do it. Even though the forecasts he checked 
proved to be but 40% right, I doubt very much whether or not he could have done as well. 
We have been getting far off our subject: happiness, health and money. There is a large part of 
mankind, which aims exclusively towards obtaining happiness, such as societies clubs and associations. 
Everything that belongs to them we would therefore include into our first group, which we termed for 
explanation's sake Venus as evening star or group No. l. 
We must include: the language that is spoken, the music which entertains, the theatre and 
movies, the circus, automobiles, foot ball and baseball, fights of any kind including war. This is a rather 
broad field to come under one planetary heading. It goes without saying that a careful work of 
dissection is required. Turned over into market language, we therefore can associate the following 
groups of stocks under the heading of Evening star; moving picture stocks, automobile stocks, steel 
stocks and even rails should go in here, since they supply means of transportation to the millions 
looking for happiness by making trips. It also includes, rubber, silk, copper and other commodities. 
The center group (group No.2) concerns health and all the circumstances and conditions leading 
to it or aiding it in a positive or negative way. Therefore, we can place into this group all 
pharmaceutical stocks, also all food stocks, which latter had been enumerated already in the first group. 
Hospitals, doctors, dentists, undertakers, cemeteries, crutches, artificial limbs, walking canes, Ex-lax, 
magazines explaining why one should eat three raw cabbages a day, clubs that further outdoor life and 
nudist colonies belong to this type. And last but not the least the food commodities sugar, fruits, cocoa, 
and wheat especially. 
The morning star group (group No.3) as the last one would include the remainder. All lines of 
business that concern money such as banking, lending money, pawn brokers, credit companies, real 
estate, governmental affairs (issuers of money), belong in here. Stocks of this group include Bank 
stocks, bonds, Credit company stocks, government bonds and real estate investments. 
88
We can see at a glance that the majority of stocks and commodities belong to the Evening star 
group. Any trader who has his Venus at the other side (as morning star) seems up against it when 
reading in these items. Only if he has Venus, as evening star should he be able to make money by 
trading in them. In order to make money trading he would have to select stocks and commodities of his 
own group or of the neighboring group. A trader having his Venus with the Sun would fare well trading 
in wheat or other grains, also with food stocks; he would have mediocre success trading in any of the 
two remaining groups, the evening star or morning star group. Such a man would never get cleaned out 
completely which may happen occasionally to the others. 
The morning star group has plenty of facilities to invest in stocks that have to do with money 
such as bank stocks, bonds and credit company stocks. They also may operate in grains and be fairly 
successful or in pharmaceutical stocks. It would be disastrous, however, for them to operate in stocks or 
commodities of the opposing group No. 3, which covers most industrial stocks and industrial 
commodities. 
In newspapers we have for the past few years an index of commodity prices, where some 
"clever" statistician conceived the idea to just merely add from day to day all the prices of the various 
listed commodities. The result is intended for traders to be plotted to make deductions of what is due for 
commodity prices tomorrow and the next day. Can you now see the error of such computations? That 
the results expected cannot be right and useful? Similar stunts are done with the stock averages, but 
fortunately they have not many food stocks included in the industrial list so not much harm can come of 
it. 
Longitude, declination and latitude are separate entities; they give best results when we are able 
to use them together (the Trinity). Let us assume now that longitude represents the "time" in the market, 
declination the price and latitude the "volume” of transactions. The most important factor for trading is 
the "timing” or, as we shall call it the longitude. When the time is right, price and volume are right 
automatically. Therefore, I have discovered long ago that if I know the day a top or bottom is due, the 
price as well as the volume will confirm. We may even go as far as saying for our crude work of 
determining tops and bottoms, we only need one of these entities and not the three. Some people who 
know nothing of laws of motion have the ability to "feel" a top or a bottom just by watching the volume 
of transactions others "feel" a top or bottom by watching the price levels. The latter, however, must 
leave some inkling as to certain price levels at which stocks and commodities like to stop. This can only 
be discovered when one has charts of the daily performance of various stocks or commodities for a 
period backwards. We can see that 52 1/2 or 67 1/2 or 72 are not merely numbers, but that they are 
numbers at which major changes occur, especially so when volume and time agree also. We just have to 
learn the knack of how to make graphs. Aside from this, we must know about the law that all motions 
are made in ellipses. This chapter, we shall touch in one of the next issues. It was one of my first 
inventions or finds. Yet, today I use the very size of ellipse, which I made to fit a certain movement of a 
stock (CTM) many years ago. 
The "Timing" or longitude is the most difficult part of all. No doubt forecasters and statisticians 
also try to use timing, I but in such crude and awkward ways that it is no wonder the average trader 
cannot detect their major error in such timing. For example they use dividend dates of stocks, dates of 
speeches of some important man, publication of railroad (car loadings, etc, as a criterion to expect a 
change of trend. Another very fine wording they have around Christmas: tax-selling time. This latter 
should explain away the fact that due to the Sun being the furthest away from us at the time of the 
Winter solstice, this Sun and not the tax-collector makes us feel somewhat "cool" towards the stock 
market many a year, but not all the years. 
Any one of these items used by statisticians are expected to bring a change of trend has received 
my own checking. It revealed that stocks on such dates can move up, can move down and can merely 
move sidewise. When the market moves up they say this was not anticipated; when the market moves 
89
down they say: it had been discounted; when we move sidewise they say it had no effect. Any baby can 
do that. But to say at this time (October 29, 1939) that next February 5th, 1940 stocks should be found 
at an important peak possibly the peak for 1940, would be a forecast. If this comes true, would this be a 
guess or a correct deduction of how planetary movements affect human beings towards desiring to own 
stocks? If I further anticipate and say that my work indicates thereafter a return to approximately the old 
120 level of Dow Jones and even could quote the date as Thanksgiving 1940, would this be a rough 
guess? But enough of this. 
Longitude, as stated before, does not fix the exact place of a planet; it does very nearly so since 
declination defines only the distance of the planet from the Equator, north or south of it and latitude 
defines its distance from the Ecliptic north or south. (See Illustration No.11, page (79). For illustration's 
sake, let us assume we fly in an airplane. The plane should represent a stock or a commodity. Its 
longitude would be 1210 55'40" West of Greenwich at the time it flies over Carmel, Calif.; it would be 
but 730 58' West of Greenwich when it flies over New York. Its flying height or altitude may be 100 
feet or 1000 feet above the ground at various times. This particular height we shall call our declination 
and latitude (the one refers us to the celestial Equator, the other to the Ecliptic). The plane can be seen 
at Carmel irrespective of its height or altitude and at some other time it can be seen at New York, 
subject to its momentary altitude.*  Declinations and latitude are therefore secondary factors while 
longitude is the primary factor. 
 
OK  = Longitude (measured in degrees of the Zodiac) beginning at O a Aries (Spring Equinox).   
HS  = Declination (measured in degrees north and south of Plane of Ecliptic). 
KS  = Latitude (measured in degrees north and south of Plane of Equator). 
OH = Right Ascension (measured in hours and minutes). 
P
= Celestial North Pole (PP = Wor1d Axis). 
P'   = Pole of Ecliptic. 
ABC = Plane of Ecliptic. 
DEF = Plane of celestial Equator. 
90
The effect of a plane while in altitude around Carmel can be very noticeable in case it would be subject 
to a forced landing. In such a case New York would not be the least alarmed about it, being too far 
away to be affected. Parenthetically be it said however, that declination and latitude are very important 
for fine work. We are at present only demonstrating the crude laws.* 
Again our car was sidetracked! Let us revert now to our title: Happiness, Health and Money. 
Happiness is the prime motive of life; health and money would therefore appear to be but an adjunct to 
it. Just size up the situation carefully for a moment and judge whether it is not so. We have to have 
some health, else we could not live; we have to have some money to supply us with health (food) and to 
sustain happiness, the prime motive. When one is in dire straights, it is surprising with what little 
money he can get along nicely! If one is sick or even bed-ridden how happy is he, when a friend drops 
in, or when he gets but a word of solace. How miserable, on the other hand, is the human being whose 
happiness has been destroyed! What would he not give to have at least some happiness in life? Wars 
destroy the happiness of thousands of people. Wars belong to our assumed group No. l, the evening star 
group. Here is the question now: which group will be most affected by a war according to our 
deductions? Bankers governments, real estate of group No.3, in a lesser degree hospitals doctors and 
undertakers of group No. 2, with ex change rates dropping headlong of moneys of warring nations 
governments, whether winners or losers, suffering during the war and afterwards yet, real estate being 
laid waste. Hospitals get jammed with wounded; doctors as well as undertakers work at top speed even 
food commodities run amuck. It clearly indicates that they all suffer. Let it be understood here that high 
prices of foodstuffs, such as wheat are detrimental to the masses although profitable to the long traders, 
while the statement may appear paradoxical it is not. (Continued in Jan. Issue). 
 
*This example is not a very scientific comparison, since latitude is again something else, but I believe it 
would help to recognize the difference between longitude on one hand and declination and latitude on 
the other.  
TOPS, BOTTOMS, GAPS. 
 
Here we have another Trinity; tops, bottoms and gaps. From your observatory between the soft 
cushions of a broker's easy chair watch them how they develop and grow! 
Bottoms can be recognized in several ways. We distinguish different types of bottoms. Each 
stock and each commodity has a habit of making one or two types of bottoms. Never another type of 
bottom will be made except the one intended by nature for each stock and each commodity. 
 
Usually, after an important top has been made and everybody has bought a full load, traders 
begin to look at one another; they wait to see who is willing and who has the money to push stocks 
higher. Of course they have bought stocks with the idea to shove them off at still higher levels to 
someone else, unless they bought for investment. Volume keeps up strongly; there are still a lot of 
people left who are willing to pay the same price for the stocks as they did, but not a higher price. 
Gradually the volume decreases, especially when the price structure slips slightly. This period is of 
greatest importance for traders. Watch! Beware of narrow movements at high levels with two or three 
successive days of small volume, coupled with a slight shading of prices. (See illustration No.12. page 
80). This period is meant when it says in the book "1001 Nights" in the story of “Aladdin and his 
Lamp”.  He threw little pebbles down into the cave. It is the Law of the Fall. A small start is followed 
by an avalanche; a series of successive drops. What is the cause that brings such a sharp drop about? At 
the time the pebbles are dropped, long buyers of stocks hold, look around for someone to push their 
stocks up; short sellers find markets too strong just then to dare to sell them short. The "pebble 
dropping period" is a sort of re-adjustment period when little trading is done---- some sort of “quiet 
91
before the storm". The next morning, however, usually a small gap appears. A gap is a space left open 
between the trading of the preceding day compared to the trading of the present day. The opening is as 
a rule very quiet, but it begins to increase shortly thereafter when all the traders are assembled in 
session. By 10:50 am the West Coast gets the opening prices over the radio. 
 
Typical top and bottom formation, showing the 10 days arc and the various gaps. 
 Such a formation was seen during March 1939, in stocks. 
This Western awakening accounts partly for the rallies and slumps at 11 o'clock noticed so frequently. 
Before the day is too far advanced timid traders and those who can read the hand-writing on the wall: 
''Mene-tekel-upharsim'', get out quick and the latter reverse to the short side; the others keep looking 
and hoping for the next run-up which doesn't seem to develop; instead, at closing time stocks are off 
quite a bit. They hope for tomorrow's rally. The next day usually a second gap downward is made, 
92
which prevents long traders from getting out at the previous day's prices, even if they had made up their 
minds during the night to do so. Instead of acting, they wait and watch and look, and what they expect 
does not happen. Prices keep going down hill. This procedure keeps on until about half of the decline 
that is in the making, has run its course. A period of rest for three or four days follows around this 
halfway down level. Some shorts cover positions for a turn here others buy stocks since they had a big 
re action. The volume remains small on the rally. Activity is very low. Holders of long stock from the 
top consider to average now, in order to get their average price down a little. Some jump in to buy an 
extra 100 shares for which a short seller is just waiting the chance to get rid of. 
 Then after all these little matters had been taken care of, the storm breaks out in earnest. A gap 
is usually again made downward, volume increases prices give considerably. This performance 
continues for 4 or 5 days, lower and lower with no end in sight. But this is when buying time arrives. 
The top buyers sell in disgust, novices in short selling see stocks drop headlong and also want to get a 
slice of the drop for quick profits. Volume becomes enormous; the tape gets behind for 5 and more 
minutes. Then is the moment to buy big bargains at your price at the market. Looking over daily high 
and low charts of stocks you will find that while this tremendous turnover is in full swing, everything 
looks just black, we are reaching, looking across the performance of the last four of five months, a place 
which was formerly an important peak or an important low point. At this point or rather at this price 
level something is active that prevents prices from going further down. An invisible wall seems to run 
through the chart here, which we shall term: a resistance level. 
Many stocks are in a habit to make just one day such a low to open higher the next day. Then 
they keep going upwards again without further ado. Wheat, on the other hand, usually makes a 
performance which we shall call pounding. It makes a low; one day on big volume, does the same the 
next day; and again the day after. The extent of the movement during the days at this bottom area may 
amount to 3c and 4c, not breaking the top nor violating the bottom except, occasionally by 1/8 or 1/4 
point. Traders in wheat are prone to place stop loss orders very closely. They get the feeling that 
yesterday was an important low and they have a false rule saying that this low must not be broken any 
more. However, it happens that for one or two ticks the price of wheat falls below the first low to pick 
away all the "safety'' stops, then turns around and goes up 10c. Therefore, at important turns stops are to 
be kept far enough away; they are even many times unnecessary under such conditions. 
When the turn upward is due, or in other words when the bottom has been made, we usually can 
figure on a ten days arc. For three of four days we have a steady rise, a day or two sideways at high 
levels but with small volume. Then follows a recession for the remainder of the ten days very nearly 
back to the previous original low level, somewhat above or even a little below. This so-called 
secondary bottom is really the beginning of the new movement whereas the first bottom, ten days 
before was the end of the down movement. This ten days arc we may call "the holiday'' or the period of 
re-adjustment from a declining market over a rising market. It can be compared with the shift of gears 
in an automobile from a reverse movement into a foreword movement. It takes a little time and, 
besides, often times the gears will grind somewhat, refusing to enter the contrary movement 
immediately. 
A common occurrence is the so-called end-gap. After a long decline, accelerating gradually, we 
pick up such enormous power downward, that people even try to sell stocks in their sleep during the 
night. News at such times is also discouraging. This news encourages long holders to dump their stocks 
at any price the next morning. Therefore, considering, the power which keeps on working even during 
the night; we cannot expect anything else but a big size gap so as to clean them all out and make this 
way bottom on heavy volume. This point we shall call "the explosion of the bomb shell". To distinguish 
between a normal gap and an end gap (the latter occurs near the bottom as well as near the peak) one 
has to just watch the volume. The moment you yourself think after a substantial decline has occurred; 
now we should really start the decline and--- you see that a gap is made of a point or so downward 
93
change your mind quickly because the gap down is the end gap. The bottom arrives either on the very 
same day or a day later. (See illustration No. 12). 
After the ten-day arc is completed, we have to expect the change of trend i.e. the new movement to get 
seriously underway upwards. After a few days of a creeping up move, the pebbles are now thrown the 
other way. We should witness a small, apparently insignificant gap upwards, telling us: here we go. 
Without keeping charts you just cannot see such a gap. As the volume gradually increases we keep 
moving upward in price without much reaction. About half ways up some stagnation usually arrives, 
which does not mean a come-back to the old low as so many figure, but it is a resting period for another 
shoot upward, similar to the picture we had on the downside before. Once this resistance, if we may call 
it such has been overcome, another gap is ordinarily made. Volume also increases quickly and trading 
becomes heavy as we parade upward to near the actual top. 
In bear markers, when we approach the very end, the volume is unusually small I would say off 
hand that any 300,000 shares full day trading volume after substantial declines would constitute a 
buying day of leaders. Recall that during June and early July, 1932, stock sales amounted to 250-300M 
shares a day; last June, at the low level nearly the same volume was obtained. At this very stage 
(October 29, 1939) the volume compared to the present price level is very small since, when we were at 
the 156 level the last time just about one year ago, we had 3,000,000 shares a day. Alone from this; we 
must deduct; that while the 156 level of a year ago; became a top area from which we dropped to 120, it 
should now become a bottom level in spite of the fact that we rose 35 points (!!) coming up from 120. 
The end of bull movements does not arrive with a daily volume of one million shares in present 
markets. We can talk of top areas when three million shares or more are dealt in. 
Mind you one more thing: a gap, whichever its direction, means that the power, the push, the 
incentive the trend or whatever we may call the planetary urge that moves our minds towards buying 
and selling, is IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GAP. So that a gap upwards means the tendency is 
toward higher levels; a gap downward means that the tendency is towards lower levels. Even when end 
gaps are made at or near extreme tops and bottoms the trend is still in the direction of the gap, but it 
represents the final exhaustion and we shall call such end gaps "exhaustion gaps" as a distinguishing 
mark for "in-between gaps. 
Of course, much more can be said about gaps, tops and bottoms which we shall do some other 
time. But for safety's sake have one more rule on gaps. When one is made on a certain day but closed 
either during the day or within a day or two, do not consider it as one; a gap is only good and worthy to 
be called a gap when it stays open and prices move away from it quickly. Prices should not linger 
around gaps after they have been made. If they do, get out for the time being with a small profit, or 
even else with a small loss, but get out and wait. Some of the inactive stocks are full of gaps. Those 
stocks I have not in mind when I talk about gaps. We consider only active much traded issues so-called 
leaders. 
We have found that stocks make secondary bottoms usually after a period of ten days from the 
actual bottom. They also make usually two tops at an interval of about ten days the latter or final top 
can be a little higher than the first or a little lower, which does not matter. In 1933, for example, rails 
made their top on July 7th. The general market then receded slightly, came back and made the final top 
in the industrials on July 18th, 1933. I distinctly recall the strain I was under during the last three days, 
from July 15th to 18th, 1933. After I had everybody short on the 7th some of the industrials peeped 
through the highs by a point or so. At that time I had for local New York consumption a daily analysis. 
In the issue of July 17th, 1933, I only wrote the following sentence: "Hold your horses, we shall not 
reap hazelnuts but watermelons, if you just stay put". They did; we had shorted Dupont around 83, 
covered it at 60 1/2 and went long again.

FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR DECEMBER 1939. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT STOCKS TO DO: 
Stocks in general should act quiet as we leave the month of November.  December, as a rule, is 
a rather quiet month with tax selling in predominance.  Some years even tax sellers get fairly good 
prices.  This should be true this month. The first four days of December should find us in a small 
reaction that should 
 
have had its origin at Thanksgiving, but the whole movement should be more a sidewise movement, 
getting ready for bigger things later on. A low for the 4th means buying back what has been temporarily 
sold around Thanksgiving, especially so when the market is drifting aimlessly and as yet has not made 
up its mind where to go. However, the movement indicated is upward. A spurt after the 4th should be 
arrested again by the 7th, producing a sidewise movement from this date over to the 14th, another 
typical December lull, but my estimation is that instead of selling out for the sidewise movement it 
95
would be better to just hold on, unless we are actually sitting at the Board and are trying to chisel a 
point or so in active leading stocks. After this is over, the stage should be set for another advance, 
steady and strong to new highs so that by December 19th, the high for the year 1939 should be reached. 
In the type of market we are having since the War had started, new high territories, whenever reached 
were followed by an attempt to distribute stocks. This sort of thing should also become evident right 
after the 19th of the month. The price movement should hold just a little below the peak level. The 
gradual up move, which should have had its inception the middle of November 1939, should be but a 
continuation of this movement, giving us a climax between December 19th and 27th, 1939. 
Holders of a sizable line of stocks should lighten off some stocks on the 19th, and the rest 
during the next few days following and remain neutral in anticipation of a reaction after we get into the 
New Year. The high levels, as said before, should prevail at high volume from December 19th over to 
around the 27th, allowing enough time to dispose of the line. Closer traders may even sell out 
completely and take a few leaders on the short side for a while into January 1940. 
The actual forecast with which I gauge stocks indicates a reaction to January 15th,1940, of 
normal size, but the wheat forecast, which is now made with the aid of Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves, 
shows a sheer drop for wheat from December 30th over to January 12th, a condition which is apt to 
carry over into stocks very strongly and we do not want to be caught napping. In conclusion, 
considering all these things and having a very high respect of Mr. Ali Baba, I say:  Take your profits 
just before or shortly after Christmas in all your stocks and have a clean slate over New Year. 
I would also take at the same time full short positions in active stocks, such as CN, RBC, X, GL 
GM, M, etc. which are to be covered around January 12th, 1940, and long positions resumed through 
out for the grand finale of February 5th, 1940. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT FROM WHEAT DURING DECEMBER.
The wheat market should have finally reached a temporary top the last day of November, after 
having had a steady rise for about three weeks. This top however, should be but a resting place to give 
traders a breathing spell. A reaction is indicated for the first 7 days of the month. Should we find the 
marker at a high level at the end of November, the way my forecast indicates, then I do suggest to take 
a temporary short position in grains for the first six days, having, however, constantly an eye on your 
commitments since when this reaction is over, we should develop a very wicked and strong upward 
movement that might get many a short into Christmas distress. The preceding cycle shows a continued 
run upwards without any reaction from December 7th clear up to the 30th of the month, a day we may 
not forget for a long time since it has the indication of a major top from which a major reaction should 
begin. I suggest to get rid of all long wheat; let someone else carry it for a while and he who wants 
more, give him some wheat you do not own (sell short). A sheer drop of the 1933 July variety in stocks 
and wheat which is to last a while, is shown as due. I would surely get busy on acting if the strength 
expected from December 7th to December 30th has developed and when drought news or other things, 
newspapers like to use for explanation of tops and bottoms, becomes acute. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT OF COTTON. 
The action of cotton for the first half of December points to somewhat lower levels a continuation of 
the drift carried over from November. As we approach mid-December, however, a spirited advance 
should begin, ending the year at or near the high levels. Would therefore suggest the buying of cotton 
around mid-December but would also accept profits as the year 1939 end.

WHAT READERS THINK. 
Xtown, N.J. October 29, 1939  
Dear Mr. Bayer. 
I have finished reading your last Preview and was left kind of bewildered because you travel so 
far back in thoughts and seem so sure that you were there once, wherever it was. 
I am living in such a different world where people are interested in only “to-day" and in what 
they "see" and "hear" and in accumulating material things it seems to me. 
I like to collect things myself like clothes and whatever one can use, just for the fun of doing it, 
finding what you want. To do this I have to trade in the market and follow the trends. I like that because 
is gives me new contacts, something to think about and it takes my mind away from my house work 
which I like too, but both take a lot of time and energy. 
To come back to why I started to write you, I have decided to order your Astrology Lessons 
now and say, before you send your Bible Lessons to "Lamme", to the Pont-des-Arches, I might want 
one later that I might better understand what it is all about. Am wondering where the "time" is coming 
from though. 
This is what I have been thinking: Since you were born in Gemini which sign is in my 11th 
house, you are naturally a good adviser and a good friend to me and I know that I have been successful 
since following you, even though at times I go absolutely against you with my commitments and come 
out right too. 
So I am sending check for $12.50 for a renewal of the weekly analysis plus $5 for the Astrology 
Lessons. 
Gratefully yours,  
Mrs. H. T.

THE SUN AND MARKET MOVEMENTS 
 
On page 75 I showed that eclipses have a lot to do with movements of markets. There is much more 
to consider yet. 
Very few people realize that the Sun has a motion of itself. Not only does the Sun run around the 
Zodiac consuming what we call one year by completing one of these rounds, but, she turns around her own 
axis every 25 days 5 hours and 38 minutes. The Sun has two poles upon which to turn around, these poles 
are inclined towards the Ecliptic at an angle of 70 degrees. The longitude of the rising node of the Sun's 
Equator is 740 36' or 14.36 Gemini. 
All these facts were discovered through observation of the so-called Sunspots. On and off we read 
in newspapers that a large quantity of Sunspots are visible upon the surface of the Sun which apparently 
create great disturbances all around; some even went as far as claiming that the number of Sunspots give an 
indication as to the trend of the market! However, such statements may be compared to a person who 
suddenly gets a lot of pimples in the face and thus is supposed to get sick or be sick. The cause of it is for 
the doctor to find out.  
Sunspots themselves are eruptions at fixed places on the surface of the Sun. Therefore; their 
apparent change on the Sun ties in with the Sun's rotation and not with their own movement. For this reason 
we can see Sunspots move in straight line's at a time when the Sun is found in or near one of the nodes 
while at other times this movement must appear in ellipses. The elliptic forms are most pronounced March 
5-7 and September 11th of each year. The lines are straight lines June 3-4 and December 5-6 of each year. 
In other words the sunspots' path is straight when the earth is in the plane of the Sun's rotation June 3 and 
December 5. 
When I stated above that the Sun's own rotation requires 25 days 5 hours, we must not forget that 
during one of these rotations the earth has also moved further and it takes a Sunspot an extra 46 hours to 
reach actually the previous point as seen from the earth. We can compare this movement with that of the 
hour and minute hand of a clock. Each hour the hour hand has to move an extra 5 minutes to catch the 
minute head.  
The total run amounts to about 27 1/4 days. 
The position angle of the Sun's axis changes as follows: 0 Jan. 4 and July 6.

The Sun has therefore a sort of a tilting motion on each side of its North Pole, extending to 260 20' 
the extreme possibility East as well as West (See Illustration No13). 
When you look over these dates and check tops and bottoms of stocks and commodities, no doubt 
you will notice that they all form major as well as minor turning points; in short, days when to expect a 
change of trend. 
Let us go deeper into this subject, by making tables. The first one gives the series of the true Sun 
motion; the second gives the series of the synodic motion. We merely add up the duration of the rounds.

The synodic revolution less the true revolution gives the actual rotation differential, 
 or:  
 
  27,28 days 
 -25,35 days
= 1,93 days 
 
Taking one half of this value to establish a mean between true and synodic motion we get:  1,93 : 2 
= 0,96.
This value we add to the true revolution and obtain: 
 25,35 days 
 +   0,96 days
= 26,21 days. 
which, without explaining the reason for the adjustment I am going to make: 26, 25 days. 
The purpose of all this work is to arrive at values that would also define price levels of stocks. After 
long trials in this direction (made according to my records on January 20th, 1935), I divided this value 
(26,25) by 24 to establish an "hour" system. The unit obtained was: 1,09375 or, to make it a little more 
simple, we used: 1,094 as the unit. This unit becomes especially valuable when four (4) of them are used 
100
and we shall soon discover that my 8 3/4 law found many years ago as explained in "Time Factors" has this 
law as the basis.

This table is large enough to cover most stocks traded. What is now the purpose of such a table and 
how can it be used? First of all, knowing that it is developed from the Sun's rotation we have to use 
constantly the Sun in its various motions, especially its angles when it crosses on the dates given above. 
The degrees being even degrees throughout, except the 230, which is 23027' and the extreme position angle 
of 260 20', we find that we have a total motion of 540 40' from the extreme East side to the extreme West 
side. This value shows in our Table No.15, 50 Units or 50 days, (40 minutes = 0,698 hours). This again 
102
points out that the cross column 2, 26, 50, 74, 98 of Table No.15 of utmost importance, although when 
looking at it haphazardly, we do not recognize this fact. In other words, whether it be in days or in price, 
these levels are important for a change of trend. 
As a practical example about the use of this Table we check on U.S. Steel from June to the end of 
November 1939. The low was 41 1/2; which corresponds to our 38th day. The high was 82 or our 75th day; 
the reaction made 65 1/2 or our 60th day. The up move was 37days expressed in Table days (38 to 74) (not 
calendar days), the reaction was 15days. So that, by using the day column but substituting the column with 
the decimals, we obtain pretty good results, especially so when we don't forget that it says in Revelation: 
"in time and time and half a time the woman gets……..” i.e. in 2 1/2 times. 
As a special note I wish to draw your attention to the fact that my Table of Unit contains not only a 
division and adjustments to suit our own purpose, never mind what the astronomers think about us 
throwing around with these values but, what I call in that Table "Days" are actually degrees East and West 
of the Sun's pole, since the extreme position angle extends to 260 15', which equals 26 1/40 or 26,250. 
However, what I have studied from astronomical works such as Madler, Herschel, Newcomb and others, 
the astronomers are not any too sure of their 26020' value. However, we know ours is correct, since we 
prove such laws via market movements which measuring stick is so much more accurate than their 
telescope, being the absolute expression of how the traders' mind all over the world is reacting upon angles. 
Price levels are nothing but momentary planetary angles. We know 26 1/4, 52 1/2, 78 3/4, 105, 131 1/4 are 
absolute resistance points. A daily chart of "Case Threshing Machine'' over the past eight years would 
prove this statement as true as two and two are four. (Make a "Case" chart from Library records to get the 
real benefit by actually seeing what I am talking about else, read back what I explained on "Case 
Threshing" in my work "Time Factors". 
The purpose of this article is solely to give you a clue as to the direction into which holes we have 
to dig, so as to get results and become able to measure extent of movements as well as time changes. 
As you will note, we have not used longitude nor declination of the Sun, but only its tilting motion. 
I shall give as an additional example Chrysler's action this past summer (1939). Low was around 63; high 
was around 96 and the reaction brought it back to end of November to 83. 
Table No. 15; Move of Chrysler began at unit 58, ended at unit 88; advance was 30 units; let us 
divide 30 by 2 ½: we get 12 units. Deduct 12 units from the peak of 88 units: 76 Units or 83 1/8. The same 
we now try with U.S. Steel. Steel started as the 38 unit rose to 75 unit or 37 units; 37 divide 2 ½ equals 
close to 15 units which was the amount of the reaction (41 1/4 - 82 - 65 1/2). 
I have explained just now the law for strong stocks. With weak stocks we have to proceed by 
expecting a reaction to 2 1/2 above measured from the low. This is hard to express in a few words, but an 
illustration will quickly show what I mean. Let us take Goodyear Tyre and use approximate prices from 
recollection since I have no Goodyear chart on hand. Low was around 18 1/2. High was about 31. 
Therefore, we use units 17 to 29 or 12 units. 2 1/2 of 12 is close to 5. Instead of deducting these 5 units 
from the high unit (29 which is the same as the $31 price it reached) we add it to the low unit or to 17 
which equals the low price of about 18 1/2 .  17 plus 5 gives 22 as the unit. This 22 is in dollars 24 1/8, 
which it reached. Therefore, when we size up situations of individual stocks the reactions will show the 
strength or weakness compared to the market as a whole. You now may proceed to work up an idea how to 
figure the new tops due to be made by using the very same table the other way round!

ABOUT BOCACCIO’S DECAMERONE 
 
Since taking Bocaccio’s Decamerone to pieces, I am living in Italy.  My thoughts bring me back to 
several months spent in lovely Sicily, Palermo, Segesta, Trapani, on Monte Pelegini. 
It’s a long time ago, but somehow the Italian acquired at that time still clings to my ears and comes 
in handy right now. 
Bocaccio’s Decamerone deals with the “Black Plague” which, according to the story had taken 
place in the year of our Lord 1348. Be it said, before we go any further, that if we can interpret the writings 
of Bocaccio, we see that there never was any Black Plague at all, neither in Florence nor in Italy but the 
"Fairy Tale" is just used as an illustration to explain planetary effects, how they act in a bear market such as 
we experienced from 1929 to 1932. The title of "Decamorone'' could have just as well have been "The 
troubles of men from 1929 to 1932.'' 
There are several characters in the story. As strange as it may sound to you, all these persons are 
just one and the same person, i.e. planet, twisted into such wonderful form, talking to himself, walking 
around, singing, eating and drinking to his own health. This work, like all others mentioned previously as 
well as his supposed predecessor, Dante's "Divine Comedy" are all astrology pure and so simple. If once 
the thread is found, the more we get into the subject, the more we are astonished about the so-called 
“learned Classes". 
Getting off the subject for a moment, I wonder what the mathematicians are all doing after they are 
through with their studies?, sitting down and resting on their laurels?, or do they devote some time to think 
about where do the numbers come from and what causes numbers. What do the astronomers do after they 
quit college and know all about stars and sun and the rotation of heavenly bodies? I am nor even speaking 
about economists and investment counselors who always have ready answers to explain any sort of 
phenomenon pertaining to their lines. The more we dig, the more we recognize what a lot of guessers are in 
the world.  There is a cartoon in the S. F. Bulletin (a newspaper) ever since I have to read that paper. It is 
just one page ahead of the market sheet so I can follow this cartoon as a sideline. It depicts a man, who 
looks very wise, with a graduation cap on his noodle; sometimes they employ a hunting Indian in his stead. 
Anyhow, this picture brings forecasts on races; which sport this section seems to take very well. It is the 
fourth time I see him start with a cash fund of $200.  He bets on his own selections. Out of 50 bets he 
usually wins 15 and loses 35; so it is no wonder that his 200 dollars last him about six weeks, if that long. 
In fact the last 200 he shot away in less than three weeks. Just the same, people seem to like it and follow it.  
My opinion is that this fellow is still fairly good at his guesses, not considering what he uses to discover 
and locate his winning ponies. 
 
104
In Decamerone we find several characters. These characters are all one and the same, i.e. one and 
the same planet. In order to explain this I must give you the names of these people (too bad for native 
Italian scientists that they can't decipher their own classics....). 
 There were 7 (!!) girls: 
Pampinea 
Fiametta 
Filomenz 
Emilia 
Lauretta 
Neifile 
Elisa   
 
There were 3 (!!) boys: 
Pamfilo 
Filostrado 
Dioneo 
 
There were 3 male servants: 
Sieisco   
Ticardo 
Parmeno 
 
There were 4 maidservants:   
Misia       
Stratillia 
Licisia Chimera 
 
Here is   some arithmetic:  
7 girls   
 
 
   3 men servants  
 
+3 men  
+4 girl servants 
10 persons 
 
 
  7 servants 
 
10 persons superior   
-7    persons inferior  
3 rulers, the Trinity = 1 Unit. 
 
Explanation of the meaning of these words: 
 
In the "Legends of the Jews" we find quite often ''Ish'', which equals "God"; in the Apocrypha we find 
several daughters whose name was ''Isca'' or ''Isha'' We also have among the 12 sons of Jacob one "Isashar". 
The one form is male, the other female. So that:  
E'sa is nothing but El-Isca and  
Lucisia nothing but Lic-isha. 
The El know from Jewish laterature means God, Eli-Eli. 
Neo means new and nea is the female form for it. 
Dio is the Italian form for Deus, God. 
Filo is the Italian word for wire a thread or as we need it a line. 
 
105
Fia merely omits the "1" from the feminine form. ''|Misia'', that's easy to change the way we need it. 
''Mi'' means in Italian "me"; and "sia" means "be" in the exclamation form, so that this person means: "it's 
but me, can't you see?" i.e. Pampi-nea. We know these old fellows had to cover up things. Many words 
have to be caught by the sound; we have Bimbo, bambino, bambini, a child male and female (o,a); so that 
Pampinea means "the new child" and Pamtilo means the "boy-child line”. Now, Tindaro should mean: Tin 
(tinnum in Latin), daro is "give" in Italian or "I shall give Tin", when this name strives, i.e. nothing. Menu 
reminds me of the French word "menu" i.e. small, so that Filomena means but a "small line," and, while we 
are at French, I just as well say that the isca explained above occurs also in French under the form of: "il y 
a", there is, So what does ''Elisa'' really mean? (E1-Isca). About Chimera the French word "Chinese" 
reveals the meaning. Stratillia and (Fi1o-) strada means the "Street" (not straight) and a street is but a line 
(look down from the Empire State Building in New York and convince yourself). 
As you now may recognize from what I explained here, the real astrology does not bother much 
about planets, where they are in the heaven but it produces its findings by means of lines (angular lines). 
Which lines and what kind of lines they are I shall let you find that out. A hint to the clever is enough. 
Aside of the Decarmerone Bocaccio also wrote: Amorous Fiametta, a sort of an appendix to 
Decamerone. Therein he has some fine statements and explanations borne of which I shall enlarge here. 
 
Page 103:  
my copy (Rarity Press NY, 1931):  
"Such feigned jests and invented tales could not AS A TRUE MATTER be justly set down 
in divers fabulous books." 
He means:  People just would not believe it anyhow if I would use the nature language. 
 
Page 137: 
 ''But why do I allege old examples?''  
He means: Why do I make comparisons with past performances of markets? Answer: 
Because in the past performance movements is the key to the solution. 
 
Page 102:  
"Who would have believed that LOVE could have taught me such ASTROLOGY, a science 
more FIT FOR FINEST WITS and profound JUDGEMENT and NOT FOR A TROUBLED 
MIND occupied with his fury. 
He means: One planet, called LOVE was the one who showed him the road to the solution; 
plenty of thinking is necessary and astrology is not for a person to study when he or she is 
full of troubles, occupied to "get himself out of a hole". In other words when you have made 
big blunders, it won't help you to consult the planets' aspects or positions to find out when 
you will "get out even"... 
On page 111 he brings a double negation. I doubt that all my readers will catch this double negation 
at the first reading (which makes the thought brought forth positive). He says: "Nor is it possible to 
prescribe so precise a time to future things as many unwisely believe." With this sentence you can very 
well see how carefully we have to analyze word for word in any of the sentences brought in works of that 
kind when we endeavor to go to the bottom of things to find the actual meaning. We must not assume 
writings of this kind have been done in a hurry, just because a magazine had to get off the press in a week, 
or, as some might think errors were made due to ignorance on the part of the writer not being able to use 
the proper language. I do not want to go too far into the findings made recently, but words such as and thus, 
oh, but, of, to you, me, he etc., never mean what we associate with them, but something else, and always 
the very same something else. As your study develops, the right substitute word suddenly just falls into 
your mouth so to say, and it must be held fast, else it escapes again. 
Now to the double negation: it is in the words: nor and unwisely; "nor" in this case is a negation, it 
is not possible; "unwisely" is a negation at least to me. Unwise is the opposite of wise. Since an unwise 
man does not think, does not care, does not bother about things, he acts in a negative way.  
106
In order not to get a challenge from readers, I better correct myself by saying: the negation is in ''to 
believe unwisely", instead of in "unwisely" alone, but it covers the idea anyhow. 
Page 43: (To save space explanations are brought in parentheses): "Although this furious passion 
(trying to solve the puzzle of life) troubled my wits and dulled all my senses, one only spark of all that 
good and wisdom, which was lost and gone (he evidently had also started from scratch, since he didn't 
understand the older texts, and nobody explained them to him when he started) kindled a prudent counsel, 
and knowledge of this true rule in my smothered and consumed heart which was, that LOVE ONCE 
DISCOVERED DOTH NEVER or very seldom come to a happy and good END (the work in astrology, 
once hit right never ends). The million and one things influenced by LOVE have each their own cycle, 
which must be figured. And therefore, amongst other profound thoughts I intended not to prefer "will" 
(which is Zero) before "reason" (mathematics), in bringing such desires to their wished end. And though I 
was truly by divers intermediate chances greatly constrained (making a living probably), yet, so much favor 
was granted me that without overcharging the mark, and stoutly enduring the grief (hardship due to belief a 
solution was possible), I passed it well away. And yet, in truth, the forces, which I yet have are of sufficient 
power to uphold and conserve such counsel. Because I WRITE MOST TRUE THINGS, I have in such 
order set them down, that except he, who doth know them (!!) as well as I do being the “occasion” of them 
all, “no others”, were he OF EVER SO SHARP A WIT AND READY OF CONCEIT could understand 
that IT WAS I. (The "I" was not Bocaccio: guess who!! (Love!). And even him I pray that, for THAT 
LOVE WHICH SOMETIMES HE BEARS ME, HE would conceal that which manifesting it, would NOT 
TURN TO HIS HONOR OR PROFIT. I endeavored with all diligence and at my fittest opportunity (I 
picked the very best moment astrologically possible to insure this work to have a permanent and large 
circulation) by alluring means and I did practice fine and subtle demons trances to kindle the young 
gentleman with those coals WITH THE WHICH I WAS ENFLAMED, and to warn him to be as wary 
AND CUNNING in his proper affairs, as I WAS WISE AND CIRCUMSPECT IN MY ACTIONS." 
In these short lines Bocaccio says everything he knows who he is, what it is, where it is to be found, 
how to approach it; he does not say how it is done. This "HE" explains as he goes along. 
From 1001 Nights I have a leftover piece worth noting. It says in one story (translated already into 
market language). These is no top, there is no bottom except by LOVE. (Vol. 111,9). 
 
WHO MADE THE LATIN LANGUAGE? 
 
Due to certain astrological laws, which I have been able to dig out from all sorts of old texts (not 
astrological books in the common sense of the word), many things appear in a different light. 
Here is a law for you. We human beings are not able to create anything what may be called alive or 
living, something that would have life.  We are only able to create dead things.  When they say: “ We 
received the latest creations from France”, then this expression is not quite true. 
When Mr. L. Samenhof invented at Grodno, Russia the so-called “Esperanto Language” or Lingoa 
internacia, he created a dead language, one that is only artificial and has not life in it.  It was designed to 
facilitate commercial intercourse among nations without the necessity of learning half a dozen languages.  
In short, Samenhof intended Esperanto as a correspondence language.  However, his results were rather 
mediocre.  I would not be surprised if some readers never heard of that language.  The reason for its quick 
death was due to the fact that Samenhof knew nothing about astrology, at least not about the astrology that 
was used by the ancients. When the ancient wizards wanted to create a language, they started at the right 
moment and produced artificially a language, which was called:  "Duration Incorporated". Millions of 
people use this language today. It spread over all the earth, the same way as the Bible, another one of their 
products. Humanistic colleges teach it. As said before, an artificial language is never intended to be spoken, 
since speak in the Bible means "move". It is only used for writing, to express thoughts, since "writing" in 
107
the Bible means to draw pictures (which ones?). This artificially produced language is LATIN. The Latin 
language never was spoken, neither by Romans nor by anybody. The French the Italian, the German, the 
English languages, I am certain have been spoken many years prior to the time astrologers got up the idea 
to make an astrological language. Up to the time of this discovery I thought and believed what was taught 
us in school were actual facts. I never dreamt that they teach things about which they know little about 
themselves. They teach that English, French, Italian, and much of German is derived from the Latin 
language. However, it is exactly the opposite. The Latin language is a mixture taken from all sorts of 
languages, taken from here and there producing a language that way. The process may be compared with 
the builder of a house (also a dead product) who uses sand and cement wood and iron and produces a 
house. Being an artificial product, they could put their own meaning into the words they created which is 
actually the case and which ought to make you understand why the words found in the Scriptures must 
mean something else than they are supposed to stand for. If some thing is artificial then it is artificial good 
and proper. Does a builder put his desired style into the building? 
Why are diseases, plants, animals, medicines etc. all called by Latin names among professionals and 
not by common names? Why do they even have two names; a name and a secondary name? 
This has an astrological reason. The main name places the plant disease or animal into its main 
astrological sector wherein "it" belongs, similarly to what I have discussed in the last issue as Morning Star 
and Evening Star. The secondary name points out the exact place where "it" belongs within those sectors. 
(Hour hand and minute hand of clock). Human beings have also two names even though the smart beings 
of today put their small place first and the important place as last.. Some people such as princes and other 
similar types have a row of these secondary names to make sure they run on all four wheels. Even cities 
and villages have two names. China, Maine, means the village of China in the state of Maine. John Nord, 
means the person John of the family Nord. Now, watch the astrologers how they used it: Carpinus betulus; 
Salix pendula; Phlox subulata; Augusta Vindelicorum. The family name was used first, followed by the 
secondary name. 
When we study modern or ancient languages, we use grammars to begin with. Off hand, we should 
think one grammar to learn French would be enough for all English speaking people. It may be written by a 
Mr. X who knows that language thoroughly. However, just go to a book shop, or better yet to a second 
hand book shop. Look over grammars that treat on French! You find them by the hundreds, some good, 
others not so good. The same has happened to astrological works in past times. Some are good, others not 
so good. The best, as far as we can judge, is supposed to be the Bible, since it was selected by a great 
organization to teach the laws (even though under cloak). I prefer the Talmud. The translator of the Talmud 
into English says in his preface that he could not furnish his ten volumes of work with an index, because it 
would be too complicated. It deals with too many subjects (do you wonder?). However, he carries main 
chapters, such as: Sabbath, ''on Oaths", Blessings, Day of Atonement and many others. Now, dear reader let 
me tell you what I found these captions do mean. They are nothing but subdivisions, the same as used in 
grammars: Substantives, Verbs, Adverbs, and Pronouns. "Blessings", for examples I have as their meaning: 
"Pronouns", their individual meanings and "uses". Just look over the Scriptures and note the immense 
quantity of pronouns used: you, he, us, ours, and them, to them, for them, at them, above them, with them. 
Each pronoun has an individual covered meaning. The best start any man could get who tries to solve the 
puzzle, would be to begin with attempting to solve the meaning of the pronouns. This approach I know now 
and wish I had known it several years ago. 
When we consider how screwy some of the Latin forms are, how artificially they are built, how 
completely they are against normal logical thought, and we cannot fail to recognize that this language is a 
constructed language and not a natural language. The simplest way to demonstrate this is to remind you 
that you can put personal pronouns, such as I, you, he, she, etc. behind the verb without making the 
sentence a question. They hitched the horse the wrong way and--can ride it. The scientists of today call 
such process “Latinism" being one of the peculiarities of the Latin Language. This is illogical, since the 
108
human mind does not work this way. Man always thinks of himself FIRST. Afterwards he thinks of what 
he wants to do. "I go". Me, my person, myself, has made up my personal mind to---go. Can you reconcile 
with human nature that he says: go I? Astrologically, yes. In astrology we always have to do with angular 
distances between the planets, or in other words, we have to do with the angular distance expressed in 
angles, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees etc. It is always measured from ONE planet, whereby the other 
planet may be ahead or behind it; so that to get a little close to the secret, "I" is the middle the center while 
"you" is ahead of this center and "he" is behind this center. Therefore, knowing constantly the location of 
the planets by merely using the correct pronoun, it is much more important to know the angle that is formed 
between them. This angle is expressed with the verb, with the right verb, which always means the same size 
angle and no other size. Can you now see why in the artificial Latin language they could place the planet 
(the personal pronoun) in front as well as in back? 
While we are at this subject I will show another splendid way these ancient astrologers used to get 
around difficulties. We all know that people are subject to changes, at times subject to very important 
changes. This is due to the change of the planet that governs them, like a ray now controls the movement of 
an airplane. It is alright for scientists to have a little ray direct and move airplanes at will, but they think it 
awful if a planet would make us move like jumping jacks at its will. Where would the human will come in? 
Let us connect our thoughts with the article of last month (Evening and Morning Star) and say: The planet 
that controls you or me has been a Morning star suddenly becomes an evening star (jumping for 
illustration's sake to the condition that first it has to get in touch with the Sun). In that case the figures in the 
Bible merely change their names and be done with it. Abe was first Abram, and then became Abraham; 
Sarah was first Sarai. Jack was first Jacob; then he became Israel. This latter's change was so important that 
a special story had to be made up for it, the story of the wrestling match during the night. So that when 
another "angle" gets active with people, they change radically. As an example we quote the former 
president of the Stock Exchange who was changed into a convict; the little Paper Hanger, as the late 
Cardinal from Chicago liked to call Hitler, changed into the most feared Napoleon of modern times. 
Something changes wheat from 60c to $1.60 and at other times from $1.60 back to 80c and it is not the rain 
in the Middle West, or Boston liquidation, or commission house selling. It is the planetary force that put 
Whitney into the hoosegow and Mr. Coolidge into Presidency. Another simile that approaches closely the 
above is the matter of marriage. A girl that gets married changes, among other conditions also her name. 
She begins a new life. People say also that a girl, shortly after she gets married also changes her figure 
quite a bit (I just now don't mean that what you mean); she gets more set, her girlish ideas, thoughts, 
behavior, etc. change; even the body-form gets more "woman-like". 
I now want to touch on an idea that is highly valued by present day astrologers. It is called the pre-
natal epoch. To me, it does not mean a thing. First of all have you ever thought about that in maternity 
hospital you may find in one day twenty births occurring, some of them at one and the same minute or even 
second. They may be male or female. The astrologers have the idea that some hours, what they call 
planetary hours produce males in male hours and females in female hours. Humbug. It depends upon the 
parents and their grandparents only. The parent cycle has to create (and not of its free will either) in order 
to produce at the fixed time a top or a bottom which we shall call male or female. Only for this reason can 
we forecast markets, otherwise we could do nothing. When forecasts do not click, something is wrong with 
the calculations and not with the planets. 
A client living just a cat's jump from the Mexican border wrote me the other day that some stock 
market Services said recently that nobody could make a yearly forecast on stocks or wheat. I wrote him 
about the following as an answer: These fellows work on nothing but bluff. They know nothing about 
planetary forces, they know still less about markets. When they have to write their version on what is about 
due to happen, they stick a few heads together, each asking the other: what do you think, and what do you 
think. Shall we tell them it goes up or shall we say it goes down. Once decided upon the direction they 
build up their "opinions" and out they go to the wallow the flies. The rest of the time most likely they go 
109
after "more business". Bayer has a funny way of doing business. His main object is to master the art of 
forecasting. He does this forecasting with the craziest things a "normal" man can think of; he uses the 
Bible, of all things, Arabian stories, the Decamerone, the Hebrew Talmud and many others. He follows 
very closely the performance of the markets though. Clients come without advertising. When time for 
renewal of subscriptions to his services comes around he sends out a small note that it expires. If by the end 
of the following week the renewal has not occurred the client's head is carefully severed and he continues 
on his Talmud. 
With this small article I give you facts, which scientists for several hundred years have not seen or 
realized. For me it throws thousands of books dealing with the subject "Latin language" right out of the 
window. Such finds come to me without looking for them, since it does not bother me much whether Latin 
is an artificial language or not, as long as I can use it for my purpose and for your benefit. But, this could 
only be found and recognized because I have found THE RIGHT APPROACH last June. 
So what is Homer what is the Nibelungenlied?  What are all the books on the Index of the Roman 
Church, prior to the year 1600? They are all astrological grammars. Rome does not want anyone to get too 
close towards recognizing laws, but "forbidden fruit tastes best"! 
Why do Kings in Egyptian pictures always carry a stick? You solve the meaning of that stick and 
you have solved the puzzle of motion! "In the balance shall they be weighed"! By the way "balance" does 
not mean ''Libra'' by any means. 
 
Happiness, Health and Money 
(Continued from Vol 1,7) 
 
The only group that should benefit would be group No 1, so that two thirds of the whole would 
suffer and one third benefit, keeping that way the eternal cycles of revolving. This condition changes, of 
course, in that the pendulum is due to swing again gradually over to group No 2, then to group No 3. 
Our work and endeavor, trading markets, both in stocks and in commodities, is done with the idea 
to make money, to make it fast as safety allows, to take it away from others, who do not know values at a 
given time. We are not able to do any harm to the stock, which we buy or sell, since the stock is one and the 
same at all times. So is a commodity. One share of Auburn Motors was exactly the same when it sold at 
516 and when it sold at 2. The Company is still the same i.e. the Auburn Auto Company. The only thing 
that has changed is the momentary value. Our business is therefore to exploit the change of momentary 
values as they rise and decline. Some of you may say: why is Auburn not back with the rest at fairly high 
levels? Here is the answer: A stock is like a human being; it is also subject to the evening and morning star 
the same as we are. The tide must have moved her over from group No.1, first into group No.2, then into 
group No.3, or, to suit the previous explanation better its Venus was an evening star but reverted into the 
morning star (mourning star). Such conditions do not affect other motor stocks since Auburn Motors has its 
own birth moment, which is different from all others. Only in one thing it has a common interest: it should 
be of group No.1. But, we know from other phenomena of Nature that such changes can occur. I read today 
of a bricklayer who because a fiction writer; a New Yorker may suddenly become a Westerner and a good 
stock may suddenly become a dog. Then another phenomenon must be considered that comes into the 
picture; some people die young, others become old and never give up their pep. The extraordinary pep of 
AAC in its younger days was somewhat suspicious, (it was but born on May 16th, 1928). The same applied 
to Radio, which seems to be related to it. The underlying normal explanation for its action is this: The 
public remembers too well the hay days of Radio as well as those of AAC. When the price began to 
approach their pocket book, they bought these stocks "to death"; putting every loose dollar into it in case 
they would make up their mind to go above 400 again. But, where the public is, there is trouble. The good 
110
trader shuns issues that are talked of too much; they shun issues that are in low brackets unless the final 
bull phase is just beginning. At such time the lowliest on the list peep up and double their price often in a 
week. But beware when the peak is passed! They fade out as fast as an electric bulb can blow out. 
We get brand new ideas about trading when we understand the above explanations. It is not the 
stock that moves up and down, but it is simply the mind of the people that moves the stock! Therefore, we 
have to analyze the people's mind and not the stock the way statisticians are doing. They hitch the horse at 
the wrong end! The people's mind is as changeable as styles. Each year we have our troubles to keep in 
style; a stock, which is a favorite now, will not be one after a while. When it stops being a favorite, which 
is shown by its activity, i.e. by volume and price fluctuation, leave its long side alone. It may be idle for a 
while at high levels and then begin to prepare for a rail spin. Just then sell it short quickly and feed shorts 
right along. Remember that a high priced stock has attracted a lot of good money that refuses to be 
dislodged for a long time; usually this money steps out when dividends are passed or reduced. At such time 
the smaller crowd takes over the stock. But what the big people could not hold up, the smaller ones can't do 
either. In fact, it indicates the beginning of the real decline. When it is still lower, the odd lot traders get up 
courage and they only step out when the stock is again ready to move up. 
If you have traded for any length of time, make yourself a list of stocks or commodities that 
produced profits; make also one showing the stocks that brought you losses occasionally and a third last of 
those that hurt you. Do the same with commodities. If you have not as yet traded any commodities I do 
suggest that you try them all in due time, when conditions appear opportune, at times when my weekly 
analysis suggests the purchase of certain ones. In a year or so you should have a complete analysis of 
stocks and commodities that favor you and those, which you should not use to trade in. Never try to get 
even! Abandon that issue completely that showed a loss of a serious nature. I do not believe that among my 
clients we could find any who would react negatively on all stocks and on all commodities so that they 
would have to take losses in anything they touch. This cannot very well be, since the readers of my works 
are not people of the poor class, else they would not have excess funds for investments of some sort. It is 
but a mere matter of checking the situation. Suppose the right stock or commodity (in singular as well as in 
plural) is found, stick to it and exploit it as much as you can. There is no pity in Wall Street. Either you win 
or you lose. The odds are not against you on account of the two "virtues" mentioned in the beginning. They 
would be against you if you would follow the crowds. 
 
FORECASTS OF MARKETS FOR JANUARY 1940. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF STOCKS 
The sharp reaction in January, spoken of in the last issue, should not become as serious as pictured. 
While there is a reaction due in stocks and short positions are advisable, as we go into the month this 
reaction should climax by the 8th of the month. After a small rally of a few days, an attempt should be 
made by traders to break through the lows; they may succeed in a few issues. Mid-January, however, 
should become the final turn upwards; first slow, making things appear as if we go down further, but 
around the 20th of the month the market should suddenly straighten up and run amuck upwards, giving us a 
rise the balance of January. We should cross the December highs and go into new high ground. Looking 
just a trifle beyond January, watch February 3rd, 1940, not only watch it, but also get out of all stocks and 
take short positions generally just when everything looks rosy and bullish. Don't let us get fooled with good 
news at that time. Ali Baba says: I'm from Missouri....... Ali, Kalif, Aleph (first letter of Hebrew Alphabet). 
According to my work, stocks are due to make a top February 3rd, revising thereby slightly the statement 
of last month that the 5th should become top. 
111
 
WHAT WE EXPECT OF WHEAT 
 
Down market until January 7th; up market the balance of the month into February 5th. Therefore, 
shorts carried over from end of December 1939 should be held until the 7th, when covering is order and 
reverse to long positions before January 11th. These days naturally and automatically should bring volume 
on the down aside at the expected bottom January 7-11, 1940.  Hold the long wheat position into early 
February. 
 
WHAT WE MAY EXPECT COTTON TO DO. 
 
After a creeping but steady advance in cotton prices since April 15, 1939, which amounts to 32 
points at the date of writing (December 5 1939), we can expect a critical point when we advance fully 35 
points on the chart or 350 points in the cotton price. If a gap upward is made at this level (10.40 to 10.50 
March New York), in this case the reaction expected in March cotton from end of December, 1939, should 
bring us back to the gap level, 10.40 to 10.50 which could be reached by mid January, or anywhere 
between January 8th and 20th. At this level and time would buy back cotton and hold it into early February.

A MONTHLY PUBLICATION IN THE INTEREST OF 
STOCKS AND COMMODITY TRADERS 
All statements made in this publication are George Bayer’s personal opinion. They are based upon apparent recurring 
cycles of time and price.  The forecasts given herein, while made with the utmost care, are not guaranteed. 
 
ABOUT COMMISSIONS IN COMMODITIES 
When we trade commodities we have to know how many points it requires to cover the cost of 
the “round trip”, i.e. the cost of buying and selling each one.  The points that have to be made on the 
short as well as on the long side to take care of the broker first are as follows: 
 
All grains (wheat etc)  
1/4c 
 
 
Hides  
10 points 
 
Cotton (100 bale contract) 
6 points 
 
Lead and zinc 5 points 
 
Coffee  
 
 
9 points 
 
Lard 
 
4 points 
 
Cocoa  
 
 
9 points 
 
Silk 
 
2 ½ points 
 
Copper 
 
 
7 points 
 
Sugar No3 
3 points 
 
Cotton seed oil 
 
5 points 
 
Rubber 
12 points 
 
Flax seed 
 
 
5/8 points 
 
Wool  
.6 (6/10c) points 
 
All these commission are understood for a full contract. Wheat can be traded in less than the 
regular quantity of 5000 bushels. It can be traded in 1000-bushel lots or 1-5 contract.  The commissions 
for one such “Lot” as it is termed ranges from $2.50 to $3.00, so that there is not much difference in the 
proportion to the full contract commission rate. 
 
HOW TO LAY RAILROAD TRACKS IN THE HEAVENS 
 
The Sun is the only planet that has a fixed rotation in our calendar.  No other planet can be fitted 
into the calendar.  Venus, as well as Mercury, while close to the Sun at all times, are found at given 
dates such as January 1st of a year either in Capricorn, where the Sun is on each January 1st, or they 
may be in Aquarius already, or else they are apt to trail and move in Sagittarius on that day. 
The regularity of repetition of cycles such as we have to expect of Sun cycles, as shown in the 
article on page 85, bring us occasionally into hot water.  We can expect turning points, but this is all we 
can expect.  Chart formations should supply a cue for the direction of the change, the setting of the 
ellipse many times tells us whether it is up or down.  There is some connecting link missing which 
points out the direction of the change beforehand.  The question arises now:  If the Sun has a certain 
defined movement around its own axis, have the other planets such movement also and what is their 
time cycle, the angular motion of them?  If we plot the angular motion of the Sun on a chart, by having 
a zero line in the center, and plotting above the zero line the easterly deviation in degrees and below it 
the westerly, we may do the same with the other planets, obtaining that way several lines that wind up 
and down across the year’s chart on actual past performance some interesting results should come forth. 
When we now consider railway tracks that run from New York to San Francisco as representing 
the Sun line on our chart, we note that on the way we find several lines to branch off from these tracks, 
sometimes northward, at other times southward. For example, at Buffalo, N.Y. there is a southward 
track towards Pittsburgh, but we have no northward track. (In order to get into Canada, we use nearly 
parallel tracks, which lead at small angles towards Toronto and Montreal, but no actual northward 
track.) 
 
114
At Cleveland we also have tracks lending southward since Lake Erie won't stand for a track. At 
Chicago we find tracks running in all directions---a main center. At other points we find northward 
tracks without having southward tracks. 
Our actions, our way of doing on this earth is premeditated or dictated by the movements of the 
planets. Therefore what we construe on the earth must be available somewhere in the heavens. All we 
have to do is look for it. The race of the planets in longitude through the Zodiac does not help us very 
much to discover such pictures. However, big fields of operations are available when we use 
Declination and Latitude of the various planets by using the Sun as the main line around whose 
declination or latitude all others wind around. When using declination we must not forget that the Sun 
declination moves on a fixed angle of 23 27' so that the winding occurs along this angle. When using 
latitude we may use a straight zero line across the chart in that the Sun's latitudinal vibration is so small 
that it cannot even be plotted unless greatly magnified. It is not even shown in the ordinary 
ephemeredes. And even this Sun's latitude if plotted on an enlarged scale yields some very good results 
to locate tops and bottoms. 
If we wind the declination or the latitudes of the other planets around the Sun the way I 
explained it just now, we will get the main railroad tracks New York----Oakland with the many 
bifurcations or cross tracks. These cross tracks bring forth changes of trend in markets The difficulty 
facing traders is the immense amount of work connected with the plotting of all the planets, as well as 
the daily high and low charts needed for severe years backwards of various commodities and stocks. 
Unless they are made first, no work of value can be done. Why I say several commodities must be 
plotted is due to the fact that we have to try to locate stations in the heaven such as Chicago, or Omaha. 
They represent days such as July 17th, 1937, when every stock and every commodity makes some sort 
of a peak or places such as September 1st, 1939 when all stocks and all commodities make wild gaps 
upward. 
Careful notations of the effect of each of the crossings have to be made right into the charts, 
whether the approach of the line was from north to south or from south to north or whether they were 
made from, "half-way" points; i.e., when planets had not reached their extreme declinations or latitudes 
but turned halfway. This latter condition you will see quickly   when you plot them on charts. Each time 
the effect is different, but the effect once established does repeat well. Each planet, of course has its 
own effect again at such crossings. For example, Saturn crossing southward over Sun in Declination has 
always one effect upon wheat, but quite a different effect compared to Mercury or Venus doing it. The 
slower moving planets have more weight than the flighty ones. While Mercury and Venus cause the so-
called "jiggles", Saturn and Jupiter cause trends. 
Anyone who delves into these ideas presented here will have plenty of work and has to get 
ready for some big surprises the way tops and bottoms develop, but as in everything, experience will 
give you many times also the "feeling" which way the cat is due to jump. 
I have not quoted all the points that need watching after the chart is completed, but suffice it to 
say that when they turn at extreme low declination or latitude, or at extreme high points or at half-way 
points, important changes also come forth. 
A congregation of several crossings within a day means a real important change, especially so when 
heavy planets are involved. They are far apart in time, but when they come they give major changes.

The  5=4  3=3  Method 
 
DEFINING TOPS AND BOTTOMS WITH A MECHANICAL DEVICE 
 
When we speak of mechanical devices, we must immediately bear in mind that mechanical things 
are rigid and not flexible unless flexibility is built into it. In markets anything that is mechanical is 
rather dangerous to apply, unless several other factors are considered with it. 
During the many years of research on markets I have struck on the craziest ideas one can 
imagine to try and make movements fit something. I am digging a few things out of my files and you 
can play around with them and see how you fare. This mechanical device explained here may be 
applied to individual stocks, to individual commodities or options. It requires daily (not once in a while) 
five minutes work for one stock or one (each) commodity. If kept up for a while, and plotted properly 
on K&E paper, you will gradually obtain a line formation, which does not look at all like a wheat chart 
or a stock chart. The work should be calculated on a daily basis and--don't forget also on a weekly 
basis. There is one thing sure about this mechanical device: It has limits of possibilities; i.e., limits of 
extremes. When the line hits the ceiling it cannot be a bottom, irrespective of how swell stocks or wheat 
look just then, or cotton as far as that goes or another commodity that is plotted. When the line reaches 
the other extreme on the minus side, we are near a low and we cannot expect another plunge. If the law 
or rather the mechanical device helps you only insofar as to prevent you from becoming too bullish at a 
top or too bearish right near a low, I have done some good with it. It is strange how the psychology of 
man runs when it comes to trading, but, a look at the volume of US Steel in the article discussed in this 
issue and considering the extreme levels when this happened in 1936, it ought to tell us enough. 
RULE: You use a centerline, which is called the zero line. Make on K&E dated paper a scale by calling 
each square 2 points. One square on K&E paper is the size as we use to enter a one-point fluctuation for 
a stock or lc for wheat. 
Use about 50 points for the plus side and a little less for the minus side, drawing the zero line 
through the middle of the sheet across (January 1 to December 31). Use a separate sheet or a plain 
copybook with several columns to calculate your values. In the first column comes the date. In the 
second column you enter the amount of the advance of the day (if any) compared to the previous day. 
Turn the eights into decimals such as: 2 5/8, which, you call 2.62; 1 1/8 you, call 1.12 or 1.13. 
We can make three different kinds of charts by using the three different advances possible from 
day to day: 
a) The advance from the closing price to the next closing price, 
b) The advance from the high price compared to the high price of the next day, 
c) The advance from the low price of one day compared to the low price of the next day. 
 I have used and tested all three, the pictures obtained are very similar and you may pick from a, 
b, c, the one that is easiest to use. I also have used the advance from the high and the advance from the 
low and later on, after fully calculating the figures put the two results in line form on one chart. The 
next columns you can't use until you have enough data piled up to enable you to do some figuring; you 
need actually 9 days performance in succession to obtain the first final value needed to make an entry 
on the chart. 
The whole idea is based on "weight", meaning the pressure that is exerted upon the stock or 
wheat price by traders, A straight arithmetical chart does not give results at all but when we use several 
days and weigh them accordingly, we have a good indicator. After I have demonstrated how to compile 
it, you will note that the values farthest back are the least weighed, while the greatest weight falls 
within the last three days of market action. It seems as if I am talking around the bush just now, but 
somehow, this method has grown in my head and never was put down in writing and here I realize how 
hard it is to put ideas like that down so that they make sense and can be understood.  
116
The whole combination is odd, as you will soon see, in that I weighed the upside in a 5-4 way 
while the downside I only weighed in a 3-3 way. This I did after long tests with all kinds of 
combinations and this one turned out to give the best results. 
You add for 5 consecutive days the daily advances and carry the figure thus obtained over into 
the adjoining column. This you keep up for a while omitting on the 6th day the figure used on the first 
day so that you add but five days each time which sum is to be carried over into the third column. Each 
day the new figure is carried out into the adjoining column until you have 4 new values in the adjoining 
third column. Then you begin to carry out in the fourth (next) column the total value of four such 
figures obtained. The value obtained and entered is the final value OF THE PLUS SIDE, or the side of 
the advance. 
The next, (5th) column you leave open for the time being. It will be used to enter therein the 
difference of the 4th column of plus and of the value coming from the minus side in order to get our 
final value which itself is added or deducted from the current value. For this current value a separate 
column is provided which is the value to be plotted on the chart. 
The remaining half of the columns are used to figure the values of the declines.*  
(*By decline I mean here the difference of yesterday's high for example as compared to to-day's high if such difference 
should become minus; this will happen when yesterday's high for wheat was 1. 07 ¾ while today’s high is 1.05.  This would 
give a value of---- 2 3/4 and this I call here the decline.) 
You enter in the next column the actual decline, if any, of the day compared to the previous 
trading day. If no decline, mark the entry as 0 (zero). This also applies to the side of the advance: if no 
advance, mark 0 and use the zero in the additions. 
You need on the decline side three figures of three consecutive days, which are carried out into 
a new column and of these new values you again need three figures to be carried over into the final 
column. 
This minus final is then deducted from the plus final, giving you either a plus or a minus figure, 
depending upon which side is bigger. This final figure is then entered in the center column and also 
plotted on the chart. Omit Sundays and holidays; do not enter them as zero on each side. 
An example will illustrate this much better: (assumed values): On page 5 (June issue, 1939) we 
have the wheat chart for Winnipeg from July 1937, which we can use to make comparisons to see the 
effect of this method when the line is plotted. (Ill. No. 19). The line illustrated was developed for 
Chicago Wheat from February 1937 to the November low (7th) 1937. 
Off hand, you may say: "I can't see anything out of this chart". Looking at it closer however, we 
discover that the line does not bend over unless we are coming to a top or a bottom. Furthermore, we 
see that we can only reach a certain limit on the down side, which is around minus 10. Whenever this 
level is reached we can buy wheat on weakness or wait for the day when the line actually bends 
upwards again. The kinks of July 29-31, 1937 and August 27th to August 31st 1937 had to be ignored 
since they did not occur near the extreme possible levels.

I - 4th   and 11th ---Sunday or holiday, no entry made. 
* - Totals carried over from previous columns. 
It happens once in a while that a double kink is made near a top or near a bottom. If so, they are sure 
indications of a change of trend in the opposite direction such as is shown: July 17th-21st 1937, August 
5th-9th, September 24th-30th 1937. 
The beauty about this method is that you can establish already during the day the value, which 
has to be plotted approximately, especially, if you get quotations during trading hours or if you watch 
the market. It needs some practice. The values to be omitted are known and we can estimate those that 
have to be substituted for the next serial so as to obtain the new values for the end of the day. Many 
times the latter can be judged from the action of the market. 
The major trend cannot be discovered with this method. Of course, making a weekly index 
along the same way---using one Saturday and comparing it with the next one as explained for days---
will be an additional help towards recognizing trend. 
Mistakes in doing the figuring may prove very expensive and great care must be used in 
compiling. 
For commodities such as rubber, hides, cocoa, etc. we have to adjust the scale somewhat so that 
the line does not run off the page, but figuring out a series during a medium sized movement will 
quickly show the scale required. With stocks it is the same. Anyone who wants to plot the action of a 
low priced stock may have to double the fluctuations in order to get some sort of a movement into the 
line. The rules of interpretation and plotting remain the same. 
The difference between the two final values of plus and minus must be "attached'' to the line to 
get a continuance. They are not plotted or measured from the zero line each day, so that we need a 
column which we shall call "running value", to which we add or from which we deduct from day to day 
the differential of the 5- 4 column and the 3-3 column.  
In our example, which starts on the first of some month we can only begin plotting the 9th of the 
month. The previous compilation of figures is the "work-up" towards obtaining a final   value by 
weighing the 5- 4, 3-3 combination.

HINTS ON HOW TO ANALYZE AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK 
EXAMPLE: U.S. STEEL 
 
Under date of May 15, 1936, 9:50p.m.  I find the following entry in my notebooks. 
Analysis of U.S. Steel common, using Mercury in Longitude, alone. The analysis covers the 
period of January 21st to May 4th, 1936. As you will see from the way I shall bring this report, we have 
to take recourse to all kinds of tricks. We have do jump from one idea to another sometimes go back to 
the first idea again, at other times, abandon the original drift of thought altogether, since nothing 
tangible comes forth of it. 
It is an example of nearly four years ago, but astrological laws are good for all times (See 
Illustration No.16). 
The first step taken was to pick out tops and bottoms on whichever dates they were made. In the 
ephemeris for 1936 the position of Mercury on the day of a top as well as the position on the day of a 
bottom were looked up and noted. As next step we measured Mercury's motion from bottom to top. 
After that the positions at major turning points were grouped together. Note: that when the movement 
began, the price on January 21st 1936 for US Steel was 46 3/8 and compare that with the major drop 
from April 9th to May 4th 1936 required a Mercury movement   in   longitude of 460 16', which 
expressed in dollars amounts to 46 1/4-46 3/8. 
On January 21st, 1936 we had a bottom and the upward movement began. On February 10th we 
made a gap upwards, topping February 16th. Then we reacted to February 26th. From this day we 
rallied till March 6th and reacted till March 13th. Then we moved up again to March 19th and reacted 
to March 28th. On this day began the last rise to April 9th, which was the top of the movement. Then 
followed the big drop until May 4th 1936. In the early stage of the movement Mercury was in Aquarius 
and was just ready to turn retrograde. On March 12th, 1936 it went into Pisces and reached 40 36' 
Gemini by May 4th 1936. When measuring movements in degrees and minutes we have to reckon not 
only the movement forward but also the movement while the planet's motion is backwards (retrograde).  
From the low of January 2lst with Mercury at 17023' Aquarius we find that on January 23rd 
Mercury becomes retrograde at 17035' Aquarius. This gives us a planetary space movement of 12'.  The 
23rd of January was also a small top. We reacted to January 26th with Mercury at 170 2' Aquarius and a 
space movement in longitude of this planet of 33'. Then we went higher until February 5th, when 
Mercury reached 5038’ Aquarius; this space is 11024'. We reacted to the 8th, Mercury at 3054' Aquarius 
and a space of l044'. Another comeback until February 8th, Mercury at 20 9' Aquarius, a space of 1045'. 
At this place a gap was made upward and a new cycle began. The total movement from January 21st to 
this gap was 150 38'. 
In the meantime, Mercury became direct again (moving forward) and at the top of the 
movement (after the gap).  February 17th, we find Mercury at 2057' direct in Aquarius. This was a space 
movement of 56'. From the top of February 17th to the low of February 26th we have a space of 60 56', 
since Mercury reached that time 90 53' Aquarius. 
From the gap of February 10th to the bottom of February 26th Mercury moved all told  70 52' 
and from the very low of January 21st to this bottom it moved 230 30'. 
Mercury on March 6th, 1936 is at 200 31' Aquarius or 100 38' further than at the low of February 
26th. US Steel reacted then till March 13th when Mercury is at 00 20' Pisces, covering a space of 90 49'. 
The up and down swing covered a space of 200 37'.  
Mercury began to run faster now, after having been rather slow in its motion due to its 
retrograde movement. On March 19th we had a top in Steel when Mercury reached 9038' Pisces, having 
progressed in its motion since the 13th of the month 9018'. 
121
 
There were six stages in this complete movement: 
 
1.  
Accumulation, January 21 to February 8 
 
 
319,500 
2.  
The push upwards February 10 to February 26

5.

6.  
Decline (selling) April 9 to March 4, 1936.  
 
659,800 
 
1,088,100
122
 
We reacted until March 28th when Mercury was at 250 1’Pisces after it had moved 150 23'. These 
last two swings amounted to 240 41'. 
From the 28th of March to April 9th Mercury moved 230 19' to 180 20' Aries. Compare this 
value with the two previous double swing movements of 200 37' and 240 41' respectively. April 9th was 
the peak of the swing. 
During the drop resulting from the entire upswing of January 21st to April 9th Mercury moved 
460 16' further to 40 36' Gemini reached by May 4th, 1936. 
The price on April 9th was 72 3/8, a rise of 26 points (see Table 15, page 86). The rise 
according to Table15 amounted to14 units; let us also have a glance at Table14, where it shows that 14 
units is a cycle. 
The total upward movement in Mercury's longitudinal motion from January 21st to April 9th 
was 920 7' and the decline from that date to May 4th was 460 16', a ratio of 2: 1. 
Now we check the volume of trading during this period (Table17) whereby I do not include the 
volume of January 21st 1936 since this volume apparently belongs to the previous cycle. 
This was my finding: 
Buyers who make commitments during accumulation get out in the distribution area. 
Buyers who buy during the push are stuck; they don't sell. 
Swing buyers sell on the decline that follows. 
The upward movement from January 21st 1936 developed with rather small volume, averaging 
15,000 shares a day. When the gap upward was made on February 10th 1936, volume came into steel 
and four to six times as many people wanted US Steel compared with the two previous weeks. After 
this demand was satisfied, volume dropped off again, so that the last half of March 1936 found us in the 
normal. 10-15,000 volume per day. The next volume period appeared right at the top, when nearly 
200,000 shares were "handed over" to the bulls. During the actual decline volume was fairly high, but 
increased as we reached the bottom. Just a day or two before the actual bottom we find the same 
amount of volume as was obtained when Steel made the gap upwards February 10th, 1936. 
Coming now back to the Mercury motion during this period, we note that the entire movement 
from January 21st 1936 to May 4th 1936 was 1380 23', or 920 7' plus 460 16'. 
The entire retrograde movement of Mercury from January 23 to February 13 1936 was 150 42'. 
We note that the upward movement from January 21st to the February 10th gap meant a motion of 
15038' in Mercury, which is nearly the same as the amount of the total retrograde motion of Mercury. 
The total amount of Mercury motion between bottom and bottom (January 21st to May 4th, 1936) was 
giving us 1380 23'. This value equals 9 times 150 25'. In the following Table we have an adjustment of 
20' to take care of so as to agree with the other values, but this does not matter in the case at the 
moment: 
 
SERIES TABLE OF 150 25' (Table No. 18) 
 
1. 150 25'  
 
6. 920 30' 
2. 300 50' 
 
7 1070 55' 
3. 460 15' 
 
8 1230 20' 
4. 610 40' 
 
9 1380 45'  
5. 770 05' 
 
Of course, in everything the center is of importance. Since we have made a division of 9 the 
center becomes 4 1/2. Therefore, 4 units equals 610 40' and 1/2 unit of 150 25' equals 70 42', a total of 
680 22'. This point was reached in Mercury motion on March 28th, 1936. It was one of the most critical 
points during the movement as we can readily see from Illustration 16. 
 
Under date of May 16th, 1936 I have the following entries. 
123
 
Since I have shown in "Time Factors" that the circle should really be taken as having not 3600
but 3680 6' which is the cycle of Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions repetitions, and since I always stress the 
value of 24 hours or 24 units, we can make a corrected scale covering and exploiting the results found 
yesterday, by making a division of 24 into the 3680 6', cycle: Table No. 19. 
 
1/24 of 3680 06' is 150 20' 15"; this we call 1 unit.

This cycle gives us a mathematical cause for the rhythm shown in the US Steel's movement 
during the spring of 1936. 
In wheat we can decipher three distinct cycles that repeat rather regularly producing tops and 
bottoms sometimes bottom-bottom also top-top. These values are: 200 30', 590 20', 1400 00' 
These values pertain also to the Mercury longitudinal motion only. No other planet is considered 
with this. Make tests such as we did for US Steel. 
All Mercury values were taken from Raphael's Ephemeris; they are figured for noon London of 
each day, or 7 am, New York time. 
 
FORECASTS OF MARKETS FOR FEBRUARY, 1940 
 
STOCKS. 
 
The forecast for the second half of January 1940 should prove to be wrong as I can see at the 
time of writing this forecast (January 7th 1940). It should have read: we sell off to the 27th or 28th of 
January, then get a rally into early February. It is a good thing that the reaction, in case we bought mid-
January, will not hurt us too much since the 144 levels ought to stem it. 
 I have done a lot of revising on my work the last few weeks and as far as stocks are concerned, 
I am changing here my mind that instead of a bear year we are due for a bull year which is due to start 
with the 28th of January 1940.  So let us get into our mind a more cheerful picture than the one we had 
developed. The last few days (January 20th to 28th) could be somewhat wicked on the downside, but 
from then on a complete change of atmosphere should come. A small top is shown for February 8th 
with a kink to the 13th or 14th of the month; after   that a slow rise to the 22nd--a sharp gap due to 
124
come which should run into the month of March upward, fast, with another gap to jump over the tops of 
early January, crossing at the same time   over the peaks of November 1938 (Nov.10th) as well as the 
one of last Fall (September 7th, 1939).         
Mr. Gann says in his book. "He who does not change his mind will pretty soon have no more 
change to mind.” This is why I change my mind having very satisfactory proved and tested reasons for 
doing so. 
 
WHEAT. 
For wheat the 28th of January should also become an important low; we may have reached the 
94cent level in May, Chicago by that time, but whatever should be the price, would cover shorts and 
take the long side. We should move up slowly from then into February, would not look for selling spots 
or for temporary short position possibilities, but hold longs. The day of action should become February 
22nd and no question about that. The cat should jump upwards on that day and run right into March. 
Watch this day! If a gap is made upwards even though it may be small, take on some more wheat and 
hold it. Let's look for $1.45 in wheat. 
 
COTTON indicates also a low for the 28th of January. It is, however so strong that it will not find time 
for reactions during February, but keep right on stepping up with a gap or two upwards during   the 
performance. Hold into March. 
HIDES. While hides show a very strong trend upwards after February 22nd 1940, up to that time it 
should idle somewhat, so that a rally which develops after January 28th 1940 should peter out and the 
low of January 28th be reached again by February 22nd, a mad jump is shown from this time on. It 
should become the best commodity of the lot. 
BUTTER shows a rally from 3rd on, but not much longer than to the end of the month. 
EGGS should be at a low as we go into February and rally during February. 
COCOA shows the same tendency. 
RUBBER points to a strong rise as we enter the month and so does Lard and Cottonseed Oil. SILK 
should be bought back by the 8th of February for a good run. 
BARLEY, rye, corn and oats should join the movement of wheat. 
I feel much more happy about this discovery. It has been checked and double checked to make sure we 
don't make any blunder. 
Thus January 28th should be a low, upward from then on, or in some commodities at least some 
strength; then watch February 22nd(Winnipeg is open) for the general gap upward. This day should 
constitute the jump-off point, a similar situation as prevailed on September 1st, 1939.
STOCK AVERAGES 1872-1898 ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH MONTH 
 
Oftentimes the conversation about markets leads towards the question:  What has the market done 
before Mr Dow got up??  The idea to add a number of stocks together so as to obtain a “mean”, a 
broader view about the action of the market in general? 
On August 20, 1935, as my record shows, I wanted to know just the answer to this question.  This 
desire made me march down to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, through low built halls, inside 
of heavy barred windows, into one certain room.   
 
125
In this room I made a copy of the following: 
 
These are the averages figured out by the Federal Reserve Bank for the 1st of each month given, 
weighing the same or similar stocks as carried by Dow Jones. Aren’t we glad, that we have not been 
able to trade in the stock market between September 1877 and August 1879?  We can find two bull 
periods during all these years, one in 1881 and the other in 1892. 
 
126
ABOUT AL KORAN OF MOHAMMED 
 
The average reader of magazines who happens to get a copy of  “Previews” will get queer feelings into his 
bones when he reads some of my articles. To him they may give no sense whatever and if they do, he 
becomes so bewildered about the contents and deductions that he probably will lay it aside. 
 
A story, which tells him that the ancients thought the Earth, was square, that their Gods were 
nothing but planets and Sun he readily believes as true. When I say that these ancients knew much more 
about the movements of Mercury whom very few contemporaries ever have seen, they will not believe it. 
But, these ancients had it all over us; they knew exactly what to use to get all movements, of you and me, 
of wheat and of anything else, by using certain planets in various positions. 
 
In this issue I shall give you some hints on the Koran.  I have one copy, 2 vol. By George Sale, 
printed in London, in 1795. It is 145 years old. My two-volume set is brand new, having come from a 
private library that was auctioned off a few years ago in New York. In these volumes I had to cut open the 
pages since its purpose so far had been reserved to decorate illustrious homes.  Another copy I have which 
is contained in ‘Sacred Books,” 12 vol. Published in 1917. In the latter set, in vol. V, page 43, that author 
says in his introduction: “A famous Oriental critic once said that the best way to understand the Koran was 
to begin with the last chapter and work forward. This suggestion is really worth following.” Make your 
own comment about what these two fellows know about the Koran!  I know that they know as little as I 
know about Chinese, zero. 
 
The other author, who must be dead and buried a hundred years, won’t get hurt much of what I say 
bout him. He says in his introduction: “I imagine it almost needless wither to make an apology for 
publishing the following translation or to go about to PROVE it is a work of use as well as CURIOSITY. 
They must have a mean opinion of the Christian religion or be but ill-grounded therein, who can apprehend 
any danger from so manifest a FORGERY: and if the religions and civil institutions of foreign nations are 
worth our knowledge, those of Mohammed, the law-giver of the Arabians, and founder of an empire, 
which, in less than a century, spread itself over a greater part of the world that the Romans were ever 
masters of, must needs be so; whether we consider their extensive obtaining, or our frequent intercourse 
with this who are governed thereby.  I shall not inquire here into the reasons why the law of Mohammed 
had met with so UNEXAMPLED a reception in the world, for they are greatly deceived who imagine it to 
have been propagated by the sword alone or by what means it came to be embraced by nations which never 
felt the force of the Mohammedan arms, and even by those which stripped the Arabians of their conquests, 
and put an end to the sovereignty and very being of their Khalifs: yet it seems as if there was something 
more than what is vulgarly imagined, in a religion which has make so surprising a progress.”  Further on he 
says: “The Protestants alone are able to attack the Koran with success, and for them, I trust, Providence has 
reserved the GLORY of its overthrow.  In the meantime, if I might presume to lay down rules to be 
OBSERVED by those who attempt the CONVERSION of the Mohammedans, they should be the same 
which the LEARNED and WORTHY bishop Kidder (he kidded himself) has pre scribed for the 
CONVERSION OF THE JEWS, and which may, mutatis mutandis, be EQUALLY applied to the former, 
notwithstanding the despicable opinion that writer for want of being better acquainted with them, 
entertained of those people, judging them scarce fit to be argued with. The first rule is to avoid compulsion; 
which though it be not in OUR POWER AT PRESENT (!), I hope will not be made use of when it IS. The 
second is: To avoid teaching doctrines against common sense; the Mohammedans not being such fools (as 
he who wrote these rules), whatever we may think of them, as to be gained over in this case. The 
worshipping of images, and the doctrine of trans-substantiation are great stumbling blocks to the 
Mohammedans and the church which teach- eth them is very unfit to bring those peoples over. (whereto?) 
For how criminal so ever Mohammed may have been in imposing a false religion on mankind, the praises 
due to his real virtues ought not to be denied to him." 
127
Several more rules follow, but we have enough to chew on these here. 
 
What a nerve that fellow had to call the Koran a forgery! He is at a loss to understand why such 
a forgery could spread faster than his own Christian religion, because he does not know that it MUST 
have been started at an even more propitious moment than they were able to start the Jewish or the 
Christian religion. "I shall not inquire here into the reasons....", poor wretch, you don't even have a 
reams "Yet," he says "there was something more than what is vulgarly imagined, in a religion which 
has made so surprising a progress." You bet, dead boy, there is, but you never lived that long to learn 
about it. 
Looking 145 years back from here, what the Protestants were supposed to do to the 
Mohammedans and the rules, which he laid down, assisted by a fellow who bore the proper name (Mr. 
Kidder), needs no comment. He didn't forget the Jews either, how he was going to take care of them. 
See my article about Mr. Simpson on page 115. 
We must not condemn the poor fellow for all these wrong conclusions; he did us a great service 
by translating the Koran. He states somewhere that he translated it as carefully as he could, retaining the 
wordings. This is just what he was supposed to do. Had he used his own way, a mess similar to his 
introduction would have resulted and the thing would have been worthiest altogether. 
All these Bibles and holy books don't do us much good if we don't know what to do with them 
for our purpose (that of trading). I am not speaking of religion whatever. I am not a preacher; my sole 
purpose is to analyze stocks and commodities in a sensible way. For this purpose we have to use holy 
books. To get it over with quickly, I am going to bring here a portion of the second chapter of A1 Koran 
as translated by George Sale, and below I bring a dictionary of my own production of many words that 
are found therein, translated into the right language. You may take my work as being just as crazy as 
the laws given by George Sale back in 1795 how to convert Jews and Mohammedans to Protestantism, 
but that's all right with me.

AL KORAN. Chapter II, The Cow. (Actual Text) 
 
There is no doubt in this book; it is a direction to the pious, who believe in the mysteries of faith 
who observe the appointed times of prayer, and distribute alms out of what we have bestowed upon 
them; and who believe in that revelation, which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath 
been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and have firm assurance in the life to come: these are 
directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper. As for the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether 
thou admonish them or do not admonish them, they will not believe. God has sealed up their hearts and 
their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment. There are 
some who say, we believe in God, and the last day; but are not really believers; they seek to deceive 
God, and those who do believe, but they deceive only themselves, and are not sensible thereof. There is 
an infirmity in their hearts, and God hath increased this infirmity; and they shall suffer the most painful 
punishment, because they have disbelieved. When one saith to them, act not corruptly in the earth; they 
reply, verily, we are men of integrity. Are they not themselves corrupt-doers? But they are not sensible 
thereof, and when one saith unto them, believe ye as others believe, they answer, shall we believe as 
fools believe? Are not they fools themselves? But they know it not. When they meet those who believe, 
they say, we do believe; but when they retire privately to their devils, they say, we really hold with you, 
and only mock those people; God shall mock at them and continue them in their impiety; they shall 
wander in confusion. These are the men who have purchased error at the price of true direction; but 
their traffic hath not been gainful, neither have they been rightly directed. They are like unto one who 
kindleth a fire, and when it has enlightened him all around him; God taketh away their light and leaveth 
them in darkness, they shall not see; they are deaf, dumb and blind, therefore will they not repent. Or 
like a stormy cloud from heaven, fraught with darkness, thunder and lightning, they put their fingers in 
their ears because of the noise of the thunder for fear of death; God encompasseth the infidels; the 
lightning wanteth but little of taking away their sight; so often as it enlighteneth them, they walk 
therein, but when darkness cometh on them, they stand still; and if God so pleased he would certainly 
deprive them of their hearing and their sight, for God is almighty. O men of Mecca, serve your Lord 
who hath created you, and those who have been before you; peradventure ye will fear him; who hath 
spread the earth before you, and the heaven as a covering, and hath caused water to descend from 
heaven and thereby produced fruits for your sustenance. Set not up therefore any equals unto God, 
against your own knowledge. If ye be in doubt concerning that revelation which we have sent down 
unto our servant, produce a chapter like unto it and call upon your witnesses, besides God, if ye say 
truth. 
But if ye do it not, nor shall ever be able to do it; justly fear the fire whose fewel is men and 
stones, prepared for the unbelievers. But bear good tidings unto those who believe, and do good works, 
that they shall have gardens watered by rivers; so often as they eat of the fruit thereof for sustenance, 
they shall say: this is what we have formerly eaten of; and they shall be supplied with several sorts of 
fruit having a mutual resemblance to one another.

Bayer's Translation of Part of The Cow. 
 
Everything written in Al Koran consists of facts. Whatever is written is intended for people, 
(traders in this case), who want to study the laws of astrology the right way, by using heliocentric 
astrology; they should use definite cycles, draw lines and make cycles the way we shall show them. 
People, we begin with the laws, we explain them for you, you check carefully what has happened in 
previous cycles if you have faith in heliocentric astrology. (This shows that the ancients were not as 
dumb as the present generation takes them; they knew that the earth moves around the Sun, they also 
knew of the two planetary measurements, which can be used: 
 1) As we see the planets from the earth; this is called the geocentric position of a planet. This 
approach is used in textbooks; 
 2) As we see a planet from the Sun; this is called the heliocentric position of a planet, and this 
type of astrology is explained in the Holy Scriptures, in the myths, in 1001 Nights, in Bocaccio and in 
other ancient works. The reason why nobody ever thinks of that is plain. They take the ancients as 
having been a bunch of deaf, dumb and blind fellows, who were sorely in need of an education such the 
present generation only can supply. 
They are guided by a certain line and with it they will get results. (By that "line" is not meant 
what geocentric workers call Ascendant and Descendants neither MC and Nadir. What it is, I shall let 
you find for yourself.) To geocentric astrologers it will make little difference whether you tell them 
about it or not; they won't throw their rubbish overboard; they just refuse to listen. The line spoken of 
interferes with the direct and retrograde motion of their pets; something prevents them to "see" and just 
for that reason they will constantly get themselves into "hot water" when they use their type of 
astrology. There are some who say: "We use that line" and the previous cycle; but just the same, they 
do not use it right. They try to substitute or change the line the same way as they try to show those who 
use helio laws that their geocentric work is better. But they "deceive" (here the word must be used in 
the usual meaning) only themselves and are not even noticing it. There is a weakness in their birth lines 
and their "special" line might also be weak, so that they are bound to run themselves into troubles since 
they don't start right. When one says to them: don't start the wrong way, don't use geocentric astrology,* 
they reply: verily we know what we are doing. Don't they start wrong, I ask you, and don't even feel it? 
And when one says to them, use helio astrology as we do, they answer: Shall we act like fools? Are 
they not "fools" (this means Beings on this earth) themselves who don't figure that far ahead? When 
they meet people operating with helio astrology (planets), they say: yes, it ought to give results, too; 
but, when they retire privately to their geocentric planets they say: we love you, we can look you up, as 
to what you mean, in astrological texts, which are sold to the masses, who ought to know and who 
ridicule those people who use heliocentric astrology. The "special line" shall take care of them and keep 
them where they are; they shall always be confused in their deductions. These are people who have 
bought "mass astrology" instead of the Holy Scriptures. But their results have not been profitable, since 
they can't do anything with it. They are like one who started to study astrology and when he is all 
inflamed and excited about that which he thinks he can predict, the "special line" spoken of above 
makes a change and this change completely changes the effect of all planet's positions, angles and what 
have you and then their laws don't work at all any more for a while and they can't understand why this 
is possible; they shall not find out about it either since they are deaf, dumb and blind and therefore they 
will not change their methods. (Here fits a case of a friend of mine who, back in 1933 had worked up a 
method of counting which he started during the Bank Holidays 1933. It was plotted on a chart and-there 
was not a top or a bottom in stocks that had escaped; each top and each bottom was located from 
March, 1933, until October 21st, 1933. On that day he had a low and it was the low point. We sat that 
day together out on Long Island and he said to me: From now on I am going to put my money on this 
130
"system", as he termed it. Yes, he did put it on, but in the three months, which followed it cost him 
$4560; since "God took away his light and left him in darkness." In fact, that method stopped working 
on October 21st, 1933, and has not worked since. Such is the case with hundreds of methods that are 
fine on the surface but in practice they bring losses as soon as they are used. In my practice, clients 
have sent me many of their pet methods, some trying to help further my own work, some with the idea 
that I would check up and possibly try to improve these methods, all acting in good faith. Invariably I 
have to tell them: too dangerous for practical use. It's hard to let go of a pet. Pet methods are the ruin of 
many traders, since all these are methods of ''Unbelievers" as Mohammed calls them. 
When a heliocentric line (of a planet) comes downward having as "effect" a major drop, a gap 
down and a few long lines down (on the charts), they hold their heads since this move was not in their 
cards; they are afraid this move will never end; the "special line" had crossed geocentric lines. The 
break in prices wanted but little of taking away all their funds; whenever it crosses them upward it's 
OK, but when it crosses downward, hell gets loose; they go retrograde. 
0 men of the present generation, use the cycle that has started all the troubles as well as the cycles that 
were before, maybe you will find the line I am talking about, the line which uses geocentric positions 
below you and heliocentric positions above you and which brings it about that a line comes down from 
the helio part and that way makes conjunctions for your benefit. Do therefore not substitute any other 
lines, if you know better. Should you be in doubt about this law which we explained herewith to the 
students, try various lines and see if they answer my explanations and check for proofs whether they all 
work as well as the "special line" which I explain here in hidden words. Unless you do find this line, 
give up all astrology, since it is this one line on which everything that follows is based on. First, find 
out that planets affect our lives and begin with the astrology whose rules include angles and 
conjunctions as used by geocentric astrologers; then switch over to the right work and do heliocentric 
work, which shall bring results. Whenever you reach points of geocentric conjunctions, you will say: 
this is what I have formerly used; there will be several conjunctions that have mutual resemblance to 
geocentric conjunctions. 
 
(*Note that Mohammed find it below his dignity to consider even people who use the rain in the Middle 
West or those who use steel output or Kilowatt production to determine movements of commodities and 
stocks.  He evaluates geocentric astrologers as having a possibility “to be saved.”) 
With this special article I have let another cat out of the bag and I hope some of you will benefit. The 
many years I have used myself geocentric astrology for want of any other have not been wasted time. It 
gave me the base, believing, like others do, that we are on the planet earth and therefore all planetary 
effects must operate on how we see the planets from this earth. Many years ago when I got hold of an 
ephemeris of 1792, I was wondering about that it contained also the heliocentric positions of the 
planets. It kept me thinking why they were printed. Conversations with other people who were 
supposed to be up on astrology, constantly led towards the explanation given above, that we, as 
inhabitants of this earth, have nothing to do with planets as they can be seen from the Sun. And it was 
these "devilish" ideas that kept me on earth for many years, until, like Enoch, I moved one day up to 
heaven to stay there. Only once a month I had to come down, writing articles for "Previews," thinking 
in geocentric terms that all of you as geocentric students would understand. But, as it is, patience has an 
end. I am fed up to think geocentrically, when I know and practice for many years solely the study of 
heliocentric astrology. 
You now may say: where can I get a book teaching me heliocentric astrology. There are no new 
books on this subject and, if there are any, anywhere, I would not suggest them for study. The only 
books that teach helio astrology are the Scriptures and allied works, of which we talk right along in 
"Previews." So, the best heliocentric astrology book you can get at Woolworth's for a quarter, plus tax. 
131
When we look over old books of the 15th and 16th century, we often find pictures of alchemists. 
Old bewhiskered men are seen in laboratories among vials and retorts; fat pig-skin bound books are 
seen lying next to them; as "they" tell us, these fellows were trying to make gold out of other chemicals. 
However, gold in the astrological sense is not the gold, which is used for ornaments or for 
minting coins. Gold means that "special line" that throws all ordinary astrological methods at any 
unexpected time onto confusion. These old fellows have been trying to find this "special line". They did 
not want others to get wise to what they were looking for (unfortunately, they could not find it either), 
so they filled up their workshops with vials and chemicals in case anybody would drop in to snoop 
around. If so, the snoopers could suspect nothing and would not be wiser than before. In fact, it would 
give them ideas, which the researchers wanted them to have. So the alchemist’s stories and pictures 
present another farce and a cover of the real doings of these people. 
They knew that, if they could find this "special line", it would be the real "gold line." 
 
THE CATERPILLARS 
 
When a trend in the market or in a particular commodity has been started, it lasts for quite some 
time. By "time" I mean eight months to a year, once in a while even longer. Let us begin to follow one 
of these movements upwards (the very same rule applies downwards, only remember, declines are of 
shorter duration in "time" and therefore much steeper, since it takes less time to tear down a house than 
it takes to build one). 
Speed around a low is very slow; price changes are very small. At fairly regular intervals a 
reaction sets in and those who still are used to play the bear side having gotten used to it from the 
previous major decline, will sell short at all opportunities but cover these shorts higher up. The general 
formation shows “hooks,” sort of fishhooks, of which the longer part forms the upswing and the shorter 
part, on which the tiny “hook” is attached, forms the downswing. As the rise keeps up for a while, 
consisting of several such hooks regularly attached to one another, we can define a picture, which looks 
like a caterpillar winding its way upward. As we go higher, there appear larger hooks. The proportion 
of the one side of the hook compared to the other side of the hook is nearly always the same from one 
hook to the other. The higher we go, the bigger the fluctuations. There will be a time coming when we 
feel as if the "real up move" is now beginning. When this feeling overcomes a regular trader I say: 
instead of getting more bullish and instead of using all profits that have accrued to buy more and more, 
it is time to get out of the long side. 
Yesterday, January 29th, I had lunch over at Watsonville, in the Pajaro Valley. The soup tasted 
fine, because I was hungry (the up move started for my intestinal system); the salad was enjoyed too, 
which we shall call a "gap upwards"; the meat was swell, chicken giblets, rice, mashed potatoes, string 
beans and plenty of curried gravy. Halfway finished with this dish I began to breathe deeply and said to 
my boss: "I just feel like wheat when it is at the top."  I kept on eating at a slower speed, but the feeling 
of hunger (of the up move) was gone and I "should" have stopped. "I should have," but I didn't; I did 
what all traders do when a top is reached. They keep on buying and I kept on eating. The caterpillar, the 
"tube" which leads to the stomach, was filled so that it just simply could not stand any more food. 
(Please imagine for our illustration of a bull movement that the stomach is above or caterpillar runs up 
to it). I could not resist the sweetest thing of all, the huckleberry pie. Stocks and commodities look the 
sweetest right on the top, so good that even the public has to buy them. Now, since I told you all about 
that meal, I also will tell you that shortly thereafter I felt really miserable. I should not have eaten that 
pie. It was simply the reaction that comes after the top is made. That extra piece caused the trouble. In 
the market, it defines that period when stocks have made a top (had enough) when they jiggle around so 
132
beautifully at the top, while they are just waiting for the moment that planets say: "down with you". 
This period does not have the form and shape of a caterpillar or of fish hooks joined together. It pictures 
on the chart like something all "blown-up," a half-moon, in some cases it forms a sidewise movement in 
narrow range with big volume. To point out exact cases for comparison, look at the wool-tops chart 
from end December to mid-January 1940. It illustrates the "half-moon" which after ward sinks down to 
produces a sharp drop. For the second case explained look at cotton in the same period end of 
December to mid-January 1940. 
The first sharp break always has a comeback, the same way as when we drop a ball to the 
ground it bounces up again. This bounce back "they" call: "over-sold" condition. Prices rise very 
sharply, but miss the old highs. At that time begins also the caterpillar formation downwards, first fast, 
then gradually slower; each successive top is lower compared to the previous top until finally, after 
many months, we reach a bottom. There we stay for quite a while. 
How do we recognize bottoms? They are easy to recognize because at that time you begin to 
worry about eighths. When you buy wheat at 61 1/8 and try to sell it at 61 7/8 and the blame thing only 
goes to 61 3/4, turns down and breaks 61 1 /8 and when you then reverse and double up for the down 
side at 60 7/8, but as soon as you are short it is up at 61 7/8, you worry terribly at that time. You are at a 
loss what will happen. The world seems to have an end because…..wheat is at a low and you don't feel 
it. On the other side, when wheat sells at 1.10, drops in a few days to 98, runs up to l.07 again your 
feeling is: what the……just a little reaction, nothing to it; you begin to put out a small short after it hit 
1.10, say at 1.05; you ride it down, but before you know it, the price is back to 1.07.  If you then get 
into a state where you send to me a wire as follows: "Shall I cover shorts and reverse to long side, quick 
answer appreciated," then you are in the same state as you were at the bottom. You don't see the top. 
The first case happened in Buffalo, N.Y., August 1939; the second case occurred at Laramie, Wyo., 
early in January 1940. 
When you begin to worry about eighth after a long decline, when you don't care about any 
limits, after long advance, then the stocks or commodities which you trade have reached their outside 
limits, Then it's time to reverse positions. 
Be sure to keep daily high and low charts; they are very important, else you can't see the 
caterpillars, nor understand my lunch example. Pictures or formations develop very fast as soon as you 
have plotted a chart for a month or so. 
 
CALL FOR MR SIMPSON! 
(Melody: Call for Philip Morris!) 
 
A few years ago I happened to get from a "prospective client" of a certain trader a ready-made 
agreement, which this client was supposed to sign. 
It was a matter of taking over the account of this client and trade it on a profit-sharing 
arrangement between client and this trader. Such things are done right along. Even I do trade for clients 
that way. But, whoever the prospective client might have been whom this trader approached, the client, 
if he had any knowledge of astrological laws, could have seen immediately the outcome of such trading 
without knowing anything about the man who approached him to trade his account. 
Without revealing the name of the trader who solicited trading accounts we shall call him Mr. 
X. This Mr. X made up sample contracts or agreements, whereby he printed the name of the party of 
the second part as Mr. Simpson. (Anyone whose name may be Simpson, please do not get offended 
with what follows, it is a mere illustration of the case at hand i.e., my personal interpretation of the 
name Simpson as used by that party Mr. X in this case.) The prospective client, provided he was 
satisfied with this type of agreement was then to receive a regular agreement, into which his right name 
was then inserted. Mr. X, when writing his sample agreement, no doubt, wanted to use a name that was 
133
common and often used, without giving any thought to the effect such name would have between a 
trader and his client, in that he felt no client would have anything to criticize about the use of a common 
name like Simpson in a sample contract. 
Anyhow, the agreement began:  
 It is agreed between Mr. X, party of the first part and Mr. Simpson, party of the second part, 
that...... etc., many lines followed in the usual form such agreements are made. 
To you, so far, such a formal agreement is just another form. To me, however, the minute I saw 
the name "Mr. Simpson," being the party of the second part, i.e., the client, brought home the RESULT 
of this agreement whoever signed it and gave this party the authority to trade the account. 
Here is the reason: This Mr. X did not write what he wanted to write; he wrote in the "sample'' 
contract that what was due to happen to Mr. Simpson before he ever started trading for him, namely:  
It is agreed between Mr. X, party of the first part and between the SON of Mr. Simp, party of 
the second part that...... etc. 
He who signed it was the "Simp" 's son. 
In the Talmud we find a Rabbi whose name is: Aha! 
Since he was a son, he could never have been a big fellow; this idea is worth noting too, And, 
the big fellow most likely would not have stood for Simp-son, but, since there are also big fellows who 
make big blunders, this Mr. X might have succeeded with them if he would have used for the party of 
the second part the name of Simp-lon. 
For verification of this article read about Mr. Kidder on page 110! 
 
ABOUT TWO BOOKS 
 
Recently a 5 vol, work of Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae came into my possession. 
It deals with dinner talks, about foods. However, it is an astrological work. 
In vol. I, page 9 it says: “Larensius was well versed in the religious ceremonies established by 
Romulus, who gave his name to Rome, and by Numa Pompilius, and he was learned in political 
institutions. All this he had acquired UNAIDED, BY THE STUDY OF ANCIENT DEGREES and 
from the COMPILATION OF LAWS WHICH THE JURISTS NO LONGER TEACH.” 
“They were already SEALED BOOKS.” 
He is talking here about astrological laws such as used in the Scriptures, which have been lost at 
the time already when this work had been written. 
 From this we can deduct that it is possible to discover these ancient laws again, provided time 
and effort is spent studying those ancient works. It is a curious thing that most all translations carry the 
notation "translated literally." As foolish as some sentences or even whole chapters sound to the 
translator, he translates them exactly as the original shows.  This he does for only one reason: he doesn't 
know what the mess is all about. He gets a subconscious feeling that he might omit or change 
something that is essential for students of this type of work. Therefore, we have to assume that the 
ancients were even able to incorporate in their starting point the insurance of a literal translation for 
later generations. 
Another book which may be worth studying to form proper ideas concerning our work is: "Is it 
God's Word ," by Joseph Wheless, published in New York 1926, by Alfred A. Knopf. This book 
attempts to bring comparisons between various types of religions, analyzes sections and chapters of the 
Scriptures. In case you do acquire this book, consider that it is written by a man who does not use 
astrology whatever, but looks at it with the eye of the average man. Some of his logic is very fine, 
especially so, when we constantly keep in mind that the works are nothing but astrological laws, that he 
speaks of planets, of their movements in the heaven, how they affect the human brains. Of course, his 
134
chapter XII is not so good where he writes about "Bible Theology and modern Truth." In this chapter he 
brings "Conflict between science and religion" is the same as "Knowledge and the outpourings of 
Moses." Every path of Natural science is closed with the sign: "No thoroughfare, Mr. Moses." That this 
modern view is a lot of humbug I believe I have amply shown at various points of "Preview." As I 
stated recently, if human beings and especially scientists would accept the law: Man's will is a big Zero, 
there would be no more signs:  "We moderns have no more use for Moses."  Of course, it make a 
tremendous difference whether you call Moses Mr. Mercury or whether you believe him to be a person 
who lived some time ago and who led the Jews through the desert. Of course, should you go that far as 
to call Moses Mercury, you may just as well give the Jews a name of a planet, may be even two names 
since they are always used in the plural form and call the desert a certain sector in the Zodiac. 
Mr. Moses will be with us whether the "Moderns" want him or not. Such ideas border on 
atheism as far as I can judge; however, our own work brings out the true theism and that theism which 
was taught in the Scriptures. Never forget that there is a God. Who he is and what he is, that's another 
story. But someone moves wheat and stocks at his will and it is not the "insider" or groups of Zeros as 
some believe. 
Many examples are brought in this book, showing that this and that could not be or could not 
have happened. For example, on page 259 he talks about the snake, about the earth not being round. 
Now, to these modern wizards, of course it CANNOT BE. To me it is, since I call the serpent the 
latitude of a planet which winds itself snake-like around; the earth cannot be round according to the 
Bible since it is but a certain line (not the Ecliptic nor the Equator), that has to be drawn representing a 
center line. This is also why he quotes someone who said: Antipodians are theologically impossible, 
and look all the people living south of the Equator! Mr. Modern you are all wet. He does not mean 
these people at all. What he was talking about simply that below that line which represents the earth are 
not human beings, since the lines down below that earth line are the dead or inactive ones which get 
revived when they come above the earth again…. Do you, dear reader understand what I mean? Do you 
understand now that all these commentaries of the Bible written by bishops and others are not worth 
even looking at? You just continue in the line of thought as I explained above and you will get into 
Eden; you will see Adam and Eve there, you will see the sneaky snake too how she arts and why and 
when. 
 
FORECAST OF MARKETS FOR THE 
 MONTH OF MARCH 1940 
 
In the article of Al Koran I have told you about the fellow who used a watertight method from 
March 1933 to Oct 21st 1933, wherewith to catch each movement in stocks, but that after that date the 
method just simply went flooey. A similar condition I am facing at this stage with my stock forecast. As 
you well know, my stocks forecast while not 100 per cent right has been for many years hitting pretty 
well, especially during periods when the public at large did not expect a movement of the sort to 
develop. 
When mid-January 1940 came around, I noticed for the first time that the rally slated from mid-January 
in stocks could not very well develop. This was deducted by me, through the actual performance of the 
market during the first two weeks of January 1940, aside of several other factors which I use to discover 
the nearby trend. It was obvious that we could not run up from mid-January, that I mentioned it yet in 
the February issue so that you could take proper steps to prevent losses. My forecast method for that 
matter, is not out like a light, however, I saw immediately that the whole thing was a matter of a 100 
per cent turnabout face and that is that. That "special line" spoken of in "Al Koran" has something to do 
135
with it. 
Therefore, as stated in February "Preview," we should have to do here with a low during 
February and a gradual climb for several months. The way the March picture in stocks should run off is 
as follows: 
As we enter the month, the market should have a very small reaction to the 4th, then a one-day 
run-up, followed by a narrow movement over to the 10th. From this day on a fairly sharp reaction for 
two days is due. The market should straighten itself out again by a comeback even beyond the 
resistance level, which stopped the advance between March 4th and 10th. However, on this "push-
through'' we should immediately hit another snag by the 17th. We should develop a sidewise movement 
over to the 25th, followed by a small "shake-out" for two days, which is to end by the 27th of March. A 
run-up to the resistance level of the previous ten days should come forth lasting till the 31st   of the 
month. The whole month should represent a further accumulation period, around the 150-153 level of 
Dow Jones. A few days after we have entered the month of April we can look for higher levels. 
This deduction should prove correct, provided we start with an up move between February 20th 
and February 24th. However, let us watch closely whether or not February 20-24 period begins an up 
move. SHOULD THIS PERIOD BECOME A TOP from which we drift downward, then conclude 
without further ado that all dates furnished above for the month of March have to bring forth opposite 
effects so that, what I figure here as tops should become bottoms, and what I figure to become bottoms 
are then due to become tops. Readers who have experience in changing their positions should have no 
difficulty to adjust themselves accordingly. 
 
This is a period just now, which calls for patience. However we have to keep in mind that a 
good sized movement is due to come out of it which ought to last into October and by next month 
enough "chart picture" has developed that I can define more definitely the direction the market should 
take. I believe at this moment that my repeating cycle, which I use, has temporarily changed, so that 
tops in the previous cycle give bottoms in the current one and vice-versa. Next month will prove it. 
Then we either keep it or, if not, we have to revert back to the original cycle. It makes little difference. 
But, mind you, February 20-24 should tell the story. Follow from then accordingly. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF WHEAT: 
 
Wheat during the month of March 1940 indicates an upward movement for the first five days of 
the month, followed by a reaction to March 21st. From then on a gradual rise should develop into April. 
 
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF COTTON: 
The cotton picture has been very strong since mid-December. True, cotton has not been able to 
136
make a new shoot upward, but such strength at high levels makes many people feel as if a new sharp 
upward move will suddenly come to pass. However looking back a year, we note that cotton was selling 
around 7.40, while here it is 350 points higher. The entire up move we may consider as being the arms 
of a person, called "cotton." Then the strength from mid-December on, we shall call the body, which 
lies sidewise at high levels. What is due to happen to cotton after the body is completed? You said it: 
the legs. The legs should be represented in the chart in form of a severe decline that, once started will 
keep on going without interruption until it has reached its goal. A few days may be used up to indicate 
the place of the knee and the knee is halfway down approximately. 
I don't like cotton as a buy. I would have shorts in it and sit still. The one who can sit and wait 
should reap big profits. 
A decline is indicated for cotton from the beginning of March to the 21st, followed by 
stagnation or sidewise to the end of the month. 
Note: The "new" contracts, which came on the Board August 15, 1939, will shortly be 
exclusively traded and "old cotton" will not be traded anymore. 
 
CALL FOR MR DANTE! 
 
Readers who are particularly interested in my article, “Happiness, Health and Money” which 
began on page 73, also those who are following my astrological deductions, should buy two small 
books: The “Vita Nuova” and “The Banquet,” (Il Convito) both of Dante Alighieri. 
 
A hint for you to get into the subject is this: call “the Latin language” heliocentric astrology, the 
“vulgar language” or Italian, geocentric astrology; Greek, call it the combination of helio and geo. 
Italian call Latitude and German call Declination, all these in Geocentric work. 
 
Therefore, speaking of the present war, geocentric latitudes are on the “outs” with geocentric 
declinations.  So, what can we “imps” do about it? 
 
Study these works slowly, no rush to know the end of the story. Unless you know that these are 
astrological works, they are good media to get you to sleep; if you know they are astrological works of 
the finest type, they stir up your thoughts and prove that I am correct in all articles, which I brought so 
far. I myself tackled these two books only recently for actual study.  They had been lying around 
without having been used. 
 
And Dante is a planet and not a person: (See “The Banquet”, book 2, Chapter VII, middle article 
No. 1): “Hear that discourse I hold within my heart”= Watch the retrograde movement that is found 
within my forward movement.   
 
The translator of my copy of Dante’s “Banquet,” London 1889 (translated by Katherine 
Hilliard), on page 117 carries a footnote as follows: "This passage has been thought by many 
commentators to prove Dante's IGNORANCE of Greek; but Fraticelli thinks that, on the one hand, it 
may have been impossible to procure the original in Florence at that date, and, on the other, that Dante 
quotes Homer, whose poetry he says is not translated into Latin." This footnote pertains to the 
following sentence in Dante's Banquet: "What Aristotle said about it we cannot exactly tell, because his 
opinion is not the same in one translation as in the other." 
Poor Mr. Aristotle, planet Venus, it's too bad that you have two sorts of movements in your 
body (opinion=movement), so that your cycles differ, why do the commentators think Mercury would 
not know of that? Mr. Mercury, did you ever run into Venus all these millions of years; I know you 
didn't and they knew it too, but they don't know who you are, nor who Aristotle is, 
In the "Banquet," Book I, Ch. 1 art. 3, we find the following statement of Dante:   "From 
without, in a similar way, we may observe two causes of hindrance, one of which is the promoter of 
many encumbrances, the other of sloth. The first comprises those cares of the family and the state with 
137
which most men are fittingly absorbed, so that SPECULATION is denied them. The other is the fault of 
the place where the person is born and bred, which may be not only void of all learning, but also of all 
studious persons. 
To make sure that people are taken off the right track, Mr. translator had to put his foot into this 
sentence, by adding a footnote, explaining "speculation" for the dear reader thus: speculation means the 
contemplative life. No, Mr. translator; it means just what it says: speculation. Dante means by that 
paragraph: Most people are absorbed with family life, with a job, a position, a business, with politics 
and what not. This all is befitting them though they have little time to devote to speculation i.e. trading 
stocks and commodities in a scientific way. Other people again cannot get the idea for speculation since 
they live out in the sticks, like Bayer does (the latter to finish his research); many people are not born 
and bred for speculation and have not the proper education for such work and, THEY ARE NOT 
STUDIOUS. They rather listen to the radio and to newspaper commentators. 
When you get a hold of this book you will find a very interesting continuation of this idea. 
Further down he says: Oh, blessed are the few that are seated at the table where the bread of the angels 
is eaten; and miserable are they who feed in common with the sheep! 
 This sentence shows, that there have been people that knew all the secrets of motion and that 
due to what they wrote in covered language, later generations can find it again, if they take time and 
effort. The sheep of which he speaks are what we now-a-days call "the lambs" in market language. I am 
trying to get all my clients out of the sheep line and over to the big table where there is lots of place and 
a large seating capacity. A little later he says: They, who are fed at so lofty a table are not without 
COMPASSION towards them whom they see wandering in the pastures of the brutes, and feeding upon 
grass and acorns (trend lines and conjunctions ha ha). 
Up at San Jose, Calif., a law enforcement agent tried to arrest a storekeeper because he had one 
of these pinball machines. The newspaper reported that this man had to spend $34.00 in nickels and 
dimes until he could win 10c, which he went to collect from the storekeeper, since the handing over the 
10c winning constituted the violation of the law. I am using this illustration to show that even 
commentators are at times hitting the explanation right, We find a footnote shortly after the lines 
discussed above, where the commentator says about Dante's works: "Their beauty is in their letter, their 
WORTH in their allegorical meaning. My own saying would be: "Take of all that Mardi Gras stuff 
from all these ancient works and you got the "golden line." Historic events in our sense were not worth 
registering and persons neither. All this history registry started after the year 1500 when they began to 
ape and registered facts about events more or less corrects, while everything previous were facts 
pertaining to the effects of planetary movements, registered under the clock of history.
