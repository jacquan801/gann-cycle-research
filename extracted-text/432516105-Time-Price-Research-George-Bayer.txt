The Sun and Market Movements | George Bayer (1939)
This is another pick from the wide spectrum of George Bayer's work and interests, written years before the ascend of
modern space technology and space physics. It was not until the 19th century, some 200 years after Galileo's invention
of the telescope and discovery of sunspots, that the systematic scientific study of the Sun began. During the second
half of the 20th century, correlations reported between solar activity (as manifested in the changing sunspot number
and in flares), disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field, and auroral activity clearly suggested the existence of a
physical connection between the Sun’s activity and terrestrial magnetic and upper atmospheric phenomena. 
The nature of this connection — one of the central themes of space physics — became the subject of intense study and
controversy during the first half of the 20th century. By mid-century, the prevailing theory involved ionized
“corpuscular streams” from the Sun that traveled at speeds of 1,000 to 1,600 kilometers per second and within which
the geomagnetic field formed a cavity. This picture was changed dramatically in the late 1950s when it was shown
theoretically that the outer solar corona could not be static but must be continually expanding outward. The model of
individual corpuscular streams was replaced by the modern concept of a continuous solar wind. Of fundamental
importance for the field of solar-terrestrial research were the prediction and discovery during the first decade of the

space age of a link between geomagnetic activity and the orientation of the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind
(the IMF). During the ensuing decades, space physicists made significant progress in understanding this link, which
involves the merging of the interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic fields and the consequent transfer of energy, mass,
and momentum from the solar wind into the magnetosphere, often resulting in major disturbances of Earth’s space
environment. See also HERE

innovative minds in the field of Financial Astrology. He pioneered in applying many astronomical and astrological
factors that he discovered also in the Bible to financial markets. "Planets act as beacons on the board of the river of
time and attract price", he said, and disclosed his astrological insights without the esoteric veiling that W.D. Gann
liked to sophisticate in his Tunnel Through the Air. The following compilation on "Biblical Astrology" from some of
George Bayer's 1935-newsletters, exemplify his perplexingly unconventional thinking and inspiring approach:

VENUS MOVEMENTS IN GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE USING A UNIT OF 1°9’13” 
This rule was found by measuring from the high of March 31, 1937 in Wheat. It is rather complicated for
practical use, since exact measurements must be made with degrees, minutes and second [...] We use
the single unit 1°9’13” [1.153611 degrees], also five times this unit or 6°55’18” [6.92166 degrees] or
[...] 25 times the original 1°9’18” unit which value is 34°36’30” [34.60833 degrees]. All the
measurements are to be used for geocentric longitude only. How I arrived at this 1°9’13” value I do not
recall [...] During the period a planet moves retrograde we have to DEDUCT our increment, i.e. the
values we use. When the motion of the planet is forward we have to ADD them. Be sure not to fail on
this else no results can be expected.

SPX vs George Bayer's Rule # 32 - Mercury imitates the Sun
MERCURY’S GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE 126°30’ AFTER THE SUN
This rule is one of the strangest I have been able to find. It is very simple, although it entails work to
project correctly. We use the geocentric longitude of Sun at any important top or bottom. To this
longitude we add each time the value 126°30’. When the addition has been made and the exact place
located in the Zodiac, i.e. the degrees and minutes and the right sign belonging to them, we look when
Mercury is going to pass this point. Hold fast that day! The movement that developed previously at the
Sun’s place will come off in the same direction at the Mercury place. Thus, Mercury imitates the Sun’s
effect.
[...] This law I dug out of the Hebrew Talmud. What the Sun does, Mercury does the same 126°30’
later. We only apply this rule from extreme tops and extreme bottoms. The effect is felt only several
months later and not a few weeks later. 
[...] There is a small matter to discuss yet, at least to draw your attention to. We know that Mercury
moves at times retrograde. Should that measurement coming from  the Sun reach Mercury at the time
it moves retrograde, we have first a place over which it does move direct and only after that does

Mercury retrograde and pass over the same Sun projection of 126°30’ and again after it turns direct it
must pass the same spot again.
Examples:
                
(1) At the April 1, 2014 (Tue) low in the SPX the Sun's position was at 11°29'41" (11°ARI29'41") longitude; that of
Mercury at 349°38'52" (19°PSC38'53"). 11°29'41" + 126°30’ = 137°59'41".
Mercury passed 137°59'41" longitude on August 9, 2014 (Sat); the low in the SPX was on August 7-8 (Thu-Fri).
(2) At the August 7, 2014 (Thu) low in the SPX the Sun's position was at 134°44'23" (14°LEO44'23") longitude; that of
Mercury at 133°13'37" (13°LEO13'38"). 134°44'23" + 126°30’ = 261°14'23". 
Mercury passed 261°14'23" longitude on November 22, 2014 (Sat), a low in the SPX.
(3) At the September 19, 2014 (Fri) High in the SPX the Sun's position was at 176°17'39" (26°VIR17'40") longitude; that
of Mercury at 202°26'57" (22°LIB26'58"). 176°17'39" + 126°30’ = 302°47'39". 
Mercury passed 302°47'39" longitude on January 6, 2015 (Tue), a low in the SPX.
(4) At the October 15, 2014 (Wed) Low in the SPX the Sun's position was at 201°52'09" (21°LIB52'09") longitude; that of
Mercury at 205°17'27" (25°LIB17'27"). 201°52'09" + 126°30’ = 328°44'48". 
Mercury passed 328°44'48" longitude on March 12, 2015 (Thu), a low in the SPX.
(5) At the Feb 2, 2015 (Mon) low in the SPX the Sun's position was at 313°07'13" (13°AQU07'13") longitude; that of
Mercury at 306°59'01" (06°AQU59'01"). 313°07'13" + 126°30’ = 79°37'13".

SPX and Grains vs George Bayer's » A Time and Times and Half a Time «
»In Revelations (12:14) as well as in Daniel we find quotations of "A time and times and half a time": "And the woman
was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place where she is nourished for
a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
This event tells us that at the time it was winter. The eagle of the Bible always means the zodiacal sign of the
Scorpion. The woman in this case represents the Sun, whose home is in the sign of Leo. She flew into the wilderness,
her place. The wilderness of the Bible means the sign of Leo. She was nourished in her place for a time and times and
half a time, the value of which counts to one hundred and twenty-two and one half. In as much as the biblical circle is
not three hundred and sixty degrees in length, but extends to 368° 10' 48’’, therefore the actual beginning of its
domain is at 13° 36’ 12’’ of the of the sign of Taurus and the end at 16° 21' 48" in the sign of Virgo. Jupiter and Saturn
dominate the other two portions.
From the September 29, 2014 low to the June 19, 2015 high the Sun moved 261.63 degrees through the zodiac.

Most readers are apt to ask what this has to do with the market. The answer is contained therein and lies in the time
factor of the price movements for stocks and for wheat and for other commodities. Even those who have studied
Astrology from textbooks must be greatly surprised about the above statement, because no textbook brings anything
about it. The textbooks use the circle of 360 degrees which is not the one the prophets used when they predicted
events.
Analyzing further we find the unit of “Times and times and half a time” to be 35. 1 time is 35; two times is 70; and
half a time is 17½. Adding gives us 122½. 2½ times representing 122° 43’ 36’’ or 1 time equaling 35° 3’ 53’’.
The number 35 (actually 35° 3’ 53’’), the eighth part thereof as well as the multiples of the same constitute the basis
for distance movements in stocks and wheat.«
17½   35   52½   70   87½   105   122½   140   157½   175   192½   210   227½   245   262½   280   297½   315  332½  
350   367½
Rounded this is:
18   35   53   70   88   105   123   140   158   175   193   210   228   245   263   280   297   315   333   350   368
