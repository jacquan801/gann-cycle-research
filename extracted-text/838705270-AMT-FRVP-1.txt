CHAPTER II | THE AUCTION MARKET THEORY
xx - Internal Trader
Imagine you’re looking to buy BTC to long it. The current market price is around
$100K, But you think you can get it cheaper, so you place a buy order at $90K.
Turns out, there’s a lot of demand at that price, and your order gets filled quickly.
This shows strong demand, which likely means the price of BTC will start to rise
from there.
so basically market moves based on supply and demand, not just because of some
magic indicator. The market doesn't move because of random signals it’s all about
where buyers and sellers are willing to meet at a "fair" price.
Auction Market Theory
You’ve probably heard people say things like, “MACD just crossed, time to buy!” or
“RSI is oversold, let’s go long!” These traders often don’t realize that the market
doesn’t move just because of indicators. There’s a more fundamental concept
driving price action : Auction Market Theory (AMT).
CHAPTER II | THE AUCTION MARKET THEORY

The Basics of Auction Market Theory (AMT)
AMT views the market as a two-way auction, where buyers and sellers constantly
bid to find a fair price. There’s no fixed price forever, markets always adjust
based on new information.
This auction process has two main goals :
To facilitate trading in a two way auction system.
1.
To search for a price that the market agrees is fair value.
2.
When new information comes in (news, liquidity shifts, etc.), price can break out of
the old Value Area and search for a new equilibrium.

CHAPTER II | FIXED RANGE VOLUME PROFILE

Fixed Range Volume Profile
now let’s bring in Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) to see how it connects with
this idea.
FRVP is a tool that shows where trading volume is concentrated within a specific
price range that you choose. unlike normal volume bars (which show volume per
time), FRVP shows volume per price level.
The Value Area (VA) represents the price range where 70% of all trading volume
occurred within a selected period. This range indicates the levels where most
market participants agreed on a "fair price," meaning price tends to stay within
this zone unless strong momentum shifts it outside.
Why 70%?
This comes from Auction Market Theory, which says that most trading happens in
a "fair value" zone. The 70% threshold is based on a normal distribution (bell curve
logic), where most activity is concentrated in the middle.

CHAPTER II | FRVP - BREAKOUT & BREAKDOWN
xx - Internal Trader
Break Out & Break down
If the price breaks above VAH / VAL with high volume, it means the market doesn’t
see the old Value Area as fair anymore. Based on Auction Market Theory (AMT),
this shows an imbalance, and price will keep moving up until it finds enough
sellers to create a new balance zone
Example :
from this point, if you see btc losing it’s VA, whether creating New VA (if btc break
out) or coming back to lower VA if BTC break down from current VA.
A failed auction occurs when the price attempts to break out above / below VAH or
VAL but gets rejected and returns inside the Value Area. 
This happens when the market tries to explore new price levels but fails to find
acceptance, often due to low volume, lack of follow through, or aggressive
counter orders. 
In terms of Auction Market Theory (AMT), this indicates that the market
attempted to establish a new balance but couldn't attract enough participants at
those levels. Failed auctions are strong signals for potential mean reversion
moves.
Example :
CHAPTER II | FRVP - FAILED AUCTION
xx - Internal Trader
Failed Auction
This is a classic example of auction failure, where the market probes outside the
established balance but doesn't find enough acceptance or volume to continue.
The result is often a rotation back to the Point of Control (POC) or the opposite end
of the range (VAH/VAL)
Mean reversion is the idea that price tends to return to the area where the most
trading activity occurred, which is the Point of Control (POC)
From VAH to POC to VAL
From VAL to POC to VAH 
Why does this happen?
Because the market is always seeking balance. If the price moves too far above
the Value Area High (VAH) without strong volume acceptance, it is considered too
expensive, and sellers start stepping in, pushing the price back down toward the
value area. On the other hand, if the price drops below the Value Area Low (VAL)
but there’s no strong selling continuation, buyers step in and push the price back
up toward the POC.
In simple terms:
Price moves outside the value area = Check if there's strong volume.
If volume is low = Price is likely to revert back to POC.
If volume is high  = Price may continue trending instead of reverting.
Mean reversion works best when the market is in a sideways or ranging condition.
If the market is strongly trending, the price might keep moving away from the POC
without coming back.

How to put FRVP into your chart
Based on Auction Market Theory, there is a Value Area. What we need to do is
identify the volume profile within that Value Area. Typically, we draw the Fixed
Range Volume Profile (FRVP) from the opposite candle after an impulsive move.
This shows the value area exactly when BTC finds a new value area up to the latest price.

How to put FRVP into your chart
This is a more detailed approach than the first method, which is done by
identifying two different ranges—I marked them with boxes. When this happens, I
usually use the Fixed Range Volume Profile on both.
It’s clear that there is an upper value area and a lower value area. The lower value
area can be assumed to have strong demand because the price wicked up
immediately. If the price revisits this area, there’s a high probability that it will
bounce back up to the upper value area
