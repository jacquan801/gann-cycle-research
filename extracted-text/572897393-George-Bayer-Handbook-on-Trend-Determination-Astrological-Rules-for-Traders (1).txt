Handbook on Trend Determination 
    The great Masters, the writers of the 
Scriptures, 
Talmud, 
Koran, 
Confucius, 
Buddha, 
Cicero, 
Livy, 
as 
well 
as 
Shakespeare, Goethe, Nietzsche and others 
(except Luther) propound in their writings 
nothing but ways and means to forecast 
future events.  All these writings are in 
“Code Form” so that the public can’t 
understand a word. They study “the surface” 
and like it. They eat the shell. With this book 
on hand you may try for the nut proper. All 
you will have to do is to substitute various 
motions of the planets given here for the 
names found in these books. After a while 
you can actually see how these persons in 
the stories “wander around” through the 
Zodiac. Yes, there were many before us, 
who know the laws and knew them well! 
They were able to fool the public several 
thousand years already and this work should 
throw some light into their stories. 
     This book will become a rarity since the 
rules are laid bare.  The works above 
mentioned have tremendous and wide 
distribution because they keep everything 
covered and only at great intervals does it 
happen that a serious student hits on the 
true meaning of them all.  You have enough 
data on hand after completing this study to 
tackle these masters and find most of my 
rules explained in them! 
     You have had in my work “Time Factors” 
at least some ideas about the basic laws 
that 
move 
stocks, 
wheat 
and 
other 
commodities. 
     The many inquiries coming from students 
of this book all pointed out that certain parts 
were written to high and formed immediately 
an idea that the difficulties cannot be 
overcome. 
     Of course, since June 3
rd, 1932 the day 
“Time Factors” had been begun, a lot of 
work had been done by the writer to get 
closer to the final solution of the puzzle 
“markets.” 
     In this volume I shall endeavor to start 
somewhat slower than was done in “Time 
Factors.”  I shall try to start with the ABC of 
common laws that have a bearing on market 
movements. However, in order to satisfy 
students that have mastered the previous 
work, those who are anxious to build further, 
but lack points of “starting”, I shall bring 
thoughts and ideas, which run up like fire 
works into the sky. 
     Portions of this work which on first or 
second reading are not clearly understood 
must be read and reread until they are 
understood even if it takes days.  Everything 
that has been said was for a reason.  
Superfluous words have not place.  Certain 
difficult matters were repeated with slightly 
varied works to bring home the idea. 
   It is hoped that even those readers who 
have 
had 
no 
opportunity 
to 
study 
mathematics in schools will be able to use 
every rule given herein to their advantage. 
     While I give out herewith all the laws and 
rules which I have been able to assemble in 
the course of years up to March 3rc, 1940 
concerning the movements of the markets, 
especially 
those 
of 
wheat, 
numerous 
additional rules can be found if time and 
effort is spent.  It is very likely that, after you 
completed you study of this work, you 
yourself may strike upon some simple rule 
that works uncannily too.  
     Consider constantly, that all rules brought 
here are the product of only one single mind, 
which had no assistant or collaborator. 
     The great railroad systems across the 
continent originated first in the single track 
line via Ogden, Utah.  When others saw the 
great advantage, they also built railroads to 
tap the wealth of the West.  On the same 
principle, once knowing how to go about, 
you might locate new ideas in our line that I 
have not stumbled on.  If this should be the 
case at some future time, I hope you let me 
know of it.

THE FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH 
WE VUILD OUR RULES OF 
FORECASTING MOVEMENTS OF 
COMMODITIES 
 
   All our rules are astronomical rules.  For 
this reason we have to procure astronomical 
Tables that bring the various planetary 
positions with athe aid of which we shall try 
to pick out the tops and bottoms in markets. 
   A little basic knowledge of astronomy does 
not hurt us either for better understanding of 
the subject matter.  
   It is advisable for you to purchase 
somewhere an astronomy boo9k new or old 
in which certain parts may be read through 
that are touched upon here, such as: What 
is longitude, what is declination, what is 
latitude. 
   We do need the AMERICAN EPHEMERIS 
AND NAUTICAL ALMANAC as published by 
the U. S. government of the years 1934 and 
1941.  they can be ordered for the 
superintendent of Documents, Washington, 
D. C.  The 1941 copy is $2.00, the 1940 is 
$2.50, the previous years are $2.00, up to 
1938; 1937 is $1.00 and all previous copies 
below 1937 are $1.00 each. 
   These volumes we must consider as our 
main support with out which we can’t do any 
work. 
   The Nautical Almanac shows the daily 
positions of the various planets in the 
Heaven.  The 1940 volume contains 880 
pages of such figures, the new 1941 issue 
has but 634 pages, since a lot of 
unnecessary figures have been eliminated. 
   For explanation purposes we use mainly 
the 1940 issue of the Nautical Almanac.  We 
are mostly interested in pages 163 to 239.  
The planetary positions of Mercury, from day 
to day in all sorts of positions, Venus, Mars, 
over to Neptune are covered therein such as 
Longitude, Latitude and Declination.  All 
these positions are given in heliocentric 
view. 
   We call a heliocentric view the one in 
which we look at a planet from the sun.  The 
view of planets as seen from the earth is 
called geocentric view.  The latter is used by 
astrologers who use angle positions from 
one planet to another.  We also have great 
use for it. 
   Let us check the various tables shown in 
the almanac of 1940.  We shall use the 
Mercury Tables for our purpose now.  The 
other planets are also given in the same 
order on later pages.  
   On page 163 we have: 
1) the date column running down from 
January 1
st to February 16th 1940. 
2) column for the apparent Right 
Ascension. 
3) Column for apparent Declination 
4) Column for the True Distance form 
the Earth 
5) Column for the Semi-diameter 
6) Column for the Horizontal Parallax 
7) Column for Mercury’s transit over 
the Greenwich meridian. 
   On page 171 we find the second table 
which actually is the extension of the first 
one, it should be next to it and not 
separated. 
   Therefore we continue our numbers in the 
listing.  We do no start with No. 1 again but 
continue with No. 8. 
8) the date column is resumed 
9) column for Heliocentric Longitude, 
Mean Equinox of date 
10) column for the Reduction to Orbit 
11) Heliocentric Latitude 
12) Column for the logarithm of the 
Radius Vector 
 
EXPLANATION OF THE VARIOUS 
COLUMNS IN THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC 
 
   The Right Ascension is given in hours 
minutes and seconds.  The seconds are 
figured to the hundredths of a second for 
exact work.  On the side between one date 
and the next is given its daily motion .  For 
example, the daily motion of Mercury form 
January 1
st at midnight (all positions given 
throughout the Nautical Almanac are for 
Midnight and for Greenwich) to January 2nd 
midnight in 1940 is 375.34 seconds. 
   Let us consider a plain clock on whose dial 
we find a division of 24 hours instead of 
what is ordinarily shown as a 12 hour 
division.  The minutes and seconds we use 
the same way as on a regular clock. 
   What is Right Ascension?  It is the same 
thing as longitude only expressed in a 
different way.  Longitude is measured in 
degrees, minutes and seconds and right 
Ascension is the same measure in hours, 
minutes and seconds. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
3 
   Therefore, when we wish to get an idea of 
what is longitude, we consider again a clock 
dial and divide the dial surface into 360 
degrees instead of in the usual 12 hours.  
The dial itself we shall call the path of the 
planets 
as 
it 
runs 
around 
the 
Sun. 
Astrologers divide this path into 12 signs, 
the signs of the Zodiac. 
   As said before, we have very little to do 
with so-called astrological rules, although 
many rules shall be given where the signs of 
the Zodiac are used and where the planets 
are considered as seen from the earth 
(geocentric positions). 
   The positions of the planets form a 
geocentric view are also published in book 
for, the best of which is “Raphael’s 
ephemeris of Planets’ Places”, published in 
London once a year. It can be had for 
50cents a copy from Macoy Publishing Co., 
35 west 32
nd  Street, New York, N.Y. plus 3 
cents postage for each copy. 
   We have to order immediately the years 
1934 to 1940 since we need them for the 
understanding of the very first rule already. 
 
No. 3 Apparent Heliocentric Declination. 
   The first item we see in the Nautical 
Almanac on January 1st 1940 on page 163 
for Mercury is : MINUS 22 degrees 56’ 
32”.7. the values are running downward 
from the 22 degree gradually, until we come 
to zero on February 28, 1940. At that time 
the values get a PLUS sign and run upward 
on the plus side until March 7, 1940, when 
the value turns downward again and even 
crosses over to the minus side. 
   This line as well as all the other that will be 
mentioned have to be plotted on special 
paper to get an idea of the curve picture. 
Those who have a minus and plus side, 
such as declination are to be plotted from a 
center line, the minus positions below that 
center line.  The paper suggested for use is 
No. 358-143L obtainable form Keuffel & 
Esser Co. in New York. Stores carrying 
drawing materials can obtain it for you.  
  The pictures obtainable from plotting will 
have 
all 
sorts 
of 
curves 
of 
weird 
appearance. This is just what we want to 
have. 
   Right ascension or longitudes are plotted 
as follows: 
   Call 0 hour of right ascension as equaling 
0 plus of the center line (axis); plot 6 hours 
upwards, the next six hours (6h to 12h) are 
plotted downwards from the extreme height 
back to the zero center line. 12h to 18h are 
plotted as if they were minus.  Therefore, the 
picture from now on leads down below the 
center line. The movement of the Right 
Ascension between 18h and 24h leaks 
upwards again to the zero line. 24 hours 
form one whole cycle. Another one begins 
from that point. 
   What is  the meaning of declination? We 
don’t really need the meaning of the work; if 
curious, look it up in the astronomy book. 
   Our 
interest 
is 
solely 
the 
practical 
application of lines of astronomical origin. 
   Of course, we must never confuse the 
lines. When we use a declination line, we 
must be sure that we don’t use the latitude 
line or the Paralax line. When we check 
values 
in 
the 
Ephemeris 
or 
Nautical 
Almanac, we must not read “longitude” out 
of the column “declination”. Such things 
would prove disastrous. Unless you have 
had some experience in reading Tables, 
make 
sure 
that 
you 
gain 
first 
such 
experience in reading Tables, make sure 
that you gain first such experience. You will 
acquire it easily when you take the time and 
produce the various charts for four or five 
years back, marking each single chart 
plainly what it represents, such as: decl. 
1939, Latitude, 1938 etc. never confuse 
geocentric with heliocentric positions. 
   The declination column for Mercury on 
page 163 and up has on the side small 
values which represent the daily motion of 
this planet expressed in seconds. The value 
between January 1, 1940 and January 2, 
1940 is given as : 737”.6.  It also carries a 
minus sign, which means that the daily 
variation of the motion is negative. 
 
No. 4 and 5 True distance form Earth and 
Semi-Diameter 
   These values move together. When we 
plot these values, we find immediately that 
when 0’ (?) turns around, the other does too. 
Therefore, the true distance from the earth 
should be used in prefere3nce to the Semi-
diameter, unless it be for quick checking of 
values. The quickest check of changes can 
be made scanning the column of the semi-
diameter, but the exact work appears in the 
“True distance”. Next to the true distance we 
find its daily movement. For real find work, 
we may even divide this given “daily 
distance change” into 24 hours and get the 
sacredtraders.conm
 
4 
hourly motion. Since the speed or distance 
covered by this motion changes real fast we 
might apply the formula for the “Law of the 
Fall” and get things absolutely exact. 
However I do not advise this procedure, 
since it will lead astray; we would be looking 
for an eighth and miss ten points. 
 
No 6 The Horizontal Parallax 
   The 
Horizontal 
Parallax 
is 
also 
incorporated in the values No. 3 and No. 4. 
Its movement is regulated by the others and 
we can pass it up. 
 
No. 7 The Transit of Mercury over the 
Greenwich Meridian. 
   We do not use this value. 
 
No. 8 Date line  column of page 171. 
   This is a mere repetition of the dates 
started on page 163. 
 
No. 9 Heliocentric Longitude of Mercury 
   Heliocentric Longitude is very important. It 
is different for the interior planets, Mercury 
and Venus from geocentric Longitude. It was 
stated already that heliocentric means “as 
seen from the Sun”, while geocentric means 
“as seen from the earth”. 
   Heliocentric positions of planets as well as 
geocentric positions are measured from a 
point which is 0 degree of Aries. After going 
through 360 degrees the planet comes back 
again to the point of beginning, having gone 
through the entire Zodiac. Mercury, for 
example, makes this motion in 88 days, 
while in geocentric motion it takes about one 
year. 
   Why this 0 point Aries has been chosen as 
the beginning is of little import to us. 
Astronomy books will explain this phase. 
   As we get deeper into the subject, we shall 
note, that we strictly keep on our side of the 
fence, 
i.e. 
subjecting 
calculations 
of 
planetary motion towards finding market 
movements. The way “how” astronomers 
figure these motions is their business. The 
ancients, no doubt, had to do all this figuring 
themselves besides making the practical 
application. 
 
No. 10. Reduction to Orbit 
   Next to the Longitude we find a column 
called the “Reduction to Orbit”.   It is an 
adjustment to be applied to the heliocentric 
longitude in order to obtain the longitude 
measured along the orbit of the planet. It 
has not relation to the values of True 
Distance form the Earth, Semi-diameter nor 
Parallax. It belongs strictly to the heliocentric 
Longitude. 
 
No. 11. The Heliocentric Latitude 
   The movement of the Heliocentric Latitude 
extends over seven degrees, North and 
south (plus and minus)> On the side we find 
the daily motion in latitude as was the case 
next to column “Heliocentric Longitude”. We 
shall have much use for this column. 
 
No. 12.  The last column, “Longarithm of the 
Radius Vector” is constructed similarly to the 
“True Distance from the Earth”. The plotting 
of this vector is difficult, however to 
circumnavigate the difficulty, it is best to plot 
the daily variation which also has a North 
and South, i.e. a plus and a minus. I suggest 
to use for plotting the first two numbers only 
and call the remaining three numbers 
decimals. For example, January 1 to 2, 
1940, would be plotted as 31.3 on the plus 
side. It shows that the line of the radius 
vector’s daily motion is leading downward 
towards the Zero line, the so-called “Center 
Line”. It reaches this line on January 13, 
1940. 
 
ADDITIONAL FUNDAMENTALS 
 
   In the course of time, I have gone through 
most of the important ancient works of 
Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, and other 
religious works. The gist of them is; They 
knew all about the movements of Mercury in 
longitude, declination in latitude AND THEY 
ALSO 
KNEW 
ITS 
EFFECTS 
UPON 
MANKIND. If only the people of today would 
recognize this fact! Most of the introductions 
to these books as well as the Commentaries 
and Commentary Notes found in most of 
these works take these Ancients as having 
been a bunch of “dumbbells” “ignoramuses” 
and “fools”, whereas in reality, so far as I 
have been able to find out, they knew much 
more than we shall ever know. They have 
been able to fool the public with their 
writings for two thousand years. It is my 
belief that only a few people on and off will 
be able to fathom completely the meaning of 
their writings. All these works are written in 
code form. What they say does not mean 
that which the public considers its meaning. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
5 
Just as a telegraph code relays messages to 
a few, while to others the meaning of the 
code words is incomprehensible, so it is true 
of these books. 
   Once we take this for granted, all these 
works begin to have a different appearance. 
   The Ancients constantly referred back to 
previous times. They meant that we should 
look 
back 
to 
previous 
cycles 
and 
happenings in the movements of planets. 
   It will be well for you to go over the last 
few lines and take an hour or so to digest 
what was said. On this statement everything 
that follows is hinged. 
   The wonderful coatings, the beautiful 
stories, dealing with war and peace, with 
human affairs, whatever is of interest to the 
people were used to explain planetary 
movements. You may say “no”, in fact more 
that fifty percent of the readers will say so 
until shown, and then they will accept it only 
with a grain of salt. Many of the laws that are 
explained here are so sure and safe to use, 
especially if two or three of them agree at 
the same time, in that a change in the 
market MUST occur. While many minor 
swings can be located to the day, they are 
not always as clear and precise as we would 
want to have them. However, if we follow the 
policy of safety we do not try for small, 
insignificant 
moves, 
for 
the 
so-called 
“Jiggles”. 
   Coming back to the ancient writings, and 
their Code form, I want to draw your 
attention to the myriads of names used to 
cover up the names of planets. In Confucius, 
for example, there is a part wherein 
Confucius talks about himself. In doing so, 
he addresses a king whom he calls “Fu-
Hsia”. In another place, he talks about a king 
whom he mentions by name, but he wants 
to bring out emphatically a specific planet 
and to do so he takes recourse to another 
king. The name of the king is exactly the 
reverse spelling of his first king. The name in 
question is a rather long name with vowels 
and consonants fitting admirably for the 
reversal. Things like that can only be 
discovered when these ancient writings are 
carefully analyzed work for work, and 
sentence for sentence. Such finds tell us 
and show us what is behind the stories. 
   Another very important idea contained in 
these books is this: Whichever stories or 
books we tackle we find, first, a birth, which 
means the beginning of the cycle. We  may 
call this in our terms a Zero Aries Position in 
longitude, or else a Zero Position in Latitude 
or Declination. Shortly afterwards a second 
birth occurs, and the first born is killed. 
   This killing points towards the elimination 
of a certain line, or if not that, it means that a 
second line has started which then kills or 
eliminates the first line. (see example in 
Rule No. 37) 
   In the present work, I am not touching any 
farther on this idea since we have enough 
material on hand to work with single planet’s 
motions. It only should show how much 
deeper and farther we can penetrate into the 
subject, if we are sufficiently interested. The 
subject itself, as you will see, is so deep, 
though, with all that I will show and explain, 
you have enough on hand to trade safely. 
Combinations of the type shown in rule No. 
37 explain not only movements of markets 
but of diseases, wars, political conditions, 
personal affairs, as well as of all home 
affairs, births, marriages, deaths, etc. When 
we consider that the laws brought forth by 
the Ancients in code form cover most of the 
time volumes of two hundred to four 
hundred pages, we must not overlook the 
fact that quite a few of these ancient books 
contain but 20 or 30 printed pages. We must 
not assume that these miniature issues are 
abbreviated works. They contain all the laws 
in concentrated form. 
   I am stating this because I do not know as 
yet the size of this work. I will write as long 
as I have something to explain. At the end 
there will be simply the work “Amen”, 
meaning that’s all. 
   The subject matter itself I would not call 
difficult but strange to the average man. 
   Our way of education does not allow a fast 
or quick absorption of ideas such as I bring 
forth. In fact, my work is so much against the 
grain of the average educated person that 
the most difficult part consists in the 
separation 
of 
ideas, 
thoughts 
and 
procedures as you are want to use now, 
compared to what your are supposed to use 
when you are thorough with a study of this 
book. Any talk in brokers’ offices or at other 
places form outsiders that pretend wheat is 
going up on account of rain in Kansas, or 
down on account of frost in Saskatchewan, 
will sound so absurd and foolish that your 
just cannot stand it. The country is overrun 
with such prognosticators. We, the followers 
of ancient science, are of needs rare. We 
sacredtraders.conm
 
6 
may compare ourselves to the sharp 
movements in wheat or stocks that occur 
every once in a while, since ordinarily the 
market moves in normal range for a long 
time. The normal range may be compared to 
the public which guesses, which uses rain 
and frost, which trades with rust and mildew.  
   I stated before about repeating cycles, 
which the Ancients suggest to use. Soon, 
will you recognize that anyone not using 
planetary lines will never find the cycles of 
repetition. After you have plotted, let us say, 
the declination of Mercury or of Venus, you 
will find that the line produced has series of 
bends. From a Zero position upward the line 
occasionally gets a kink before reaching the 
extreme. This also happens on the way 
down in this declination. At other periods the 
line is straight up from Zero to the Extreme. 
Let us say, a movement was begun when 
Venus passed the Zero line and the 
movement ended when Venus was at the 
extreme of declination coming now back to 
the repetition of the cycle, we readily can 
see that a kink in it extends the time from 
Zero to Extreme by a month or two. The 
picture becomes an entirely different one in 
“Time”; that is, from one cycle to the other. 
After you have made a chart of declination a 
few years back, it is suggested that your 
compare the movement of Wheat or some 
other commodity, during each cycle. Pick 
out the Zero positions wherever they occur. 
 
CHARTS 
 
   Going down to the broker each day, 
looking at the tape and watching prices go 
by won’t help much to define the trend of 
wheat or stocks. It is a sort of passing the 
time for want of having something else to 
do. 
   What a trader needs is charts. The daily 
high and low charts of a few commodities 
and a few stocks have to be plotted each 
day even though you do only trade in one. If 
you have none, make some immediately 
since all laws given here are explained on 
hand of these charts. Use Keuffel & Esser  
paper. 
   Wheat prices are plotted one square for 
one cent of movement. In one square there 
are three small tiny lines which are used for 
the quarters. In between each small line is 
the place for the 8ths. Plot first the high of 
the day with a don then the low thereof; 
finally connect the dots with a line. Stocks 
are plotted one dollar to a square; cotton is 
plotted 10 points to a square; all other 
commodities are plotted sot he $50.00 in 
movement equals one square. Therefore, 
since cottonseed oil is valued at 36.00 per 
point and 6 goes into 50 eight times, 
cottonseed oil is plotted 8 points per square. 
   Rubber is traded so that one point of its 
movement represents $2.24. Let us divide 
$50.00 by 2.24. This gives 22. Rubber is 
plotted 22 points to a square. Hides are 
plotted 12-1/2 points to a square. Lard is 
plotted 10 points to a square. 
   All charts must be made very carefully; the 
entries are to be made daily and not once a 
week. The picture of the movements as they 
develop will gradually fasten in one’s mind 
which is of prime importance. With the aid of 
the ellipse and other factors explained later, 
a major bottom or top will stick out so that it 
cannot be missed. 
   On days when no trading is done such as 
on Sundays or Holidays we have to leave a 
blank space for that day. It is too ridiculous 
to see nicely made charts omitting lines of 
holidays and Sundays. People expect ot 
derive benefits that way, but they don’t. 
They, if they would know what causes 
movements, would probably believe that the 
planets “stand still” during holidays the same 
way as Joshua made the sun stand still 
some time ago. Planets work week days and 
Sundays; they know not holidays. The 
Nautical Almanac will show it. 
   When starting charts, begin the year about 
half-way up the seat. Should movements go 
beyond the sheet, paste a strip to it. 
   To be sure that everything goes right 
suggest to use pencil first until you get used 
to making thin lines with ink. Many a fine 
chart was spoiled by daily ink entries. 
   Charts should be kept in a binder of good 
quality, which takes a full size sheet or you 
may use those that take the chart with on 
fold. For  testing remove the single sheets; 
when through testing put them back into the 
binder. Notes may be made right on the 
charts, on the margin or into the graph 
picture. The color of the graph sheets should 
be green instead of orange. Since the 
entries are mostly made in the evening the 
green colored paper is more appropriate. 
   Data of prices may be obtained in  the 
weekly “Financial Chronicle” or from daily 
papers. 
The 
ready-made 
charts 
as 
sacredtraders.conm
 
7 
published by some firs are not to be used. 
The reason is obvious. 
 
TRADING COMMODITIES 
 
   Several clients told me they can trade only 
gains with their regular broker. Any broker, if 
he wants to, can buy or sell any commodity 
that is traded, if you demand it. His business 
is brokerage, thus all he has to do is forward 
his order to some other broker and get his 
share of the commission.  
   Others tell me that their newspaper does 
not give quotations on commodities. Here 
again is where you good broker comes in. 
He is the one from whom you can expect to 
get the daily high and low prices of any 
commodity. He will get in touch with those 
who have them. After he has procured them 
once 
or 
twice 
for 
you, 
he 
will 
get 
“accustomed” to getting the price ranges 
each day as long as you get him on the go 
once. And, if your own broker can’t get them 
there are many brokers who will gladly get 
them for you! 
   It matters little, when trading commodities 
or stocks whether or not you get the last 
eighth. When a top is indicated and you sell 
within that day, you are doing fine; the same 
with buying when you buy within a day of the 
low. All orders should be given “at the 
market”, meaning buy or sell for what you 
can get. Orders with a fixed price should be 
shunned. Supposing the market is a buy on 
a certain day and wheat sells at 78. Knowing 
that its move should be upward, does it 
make any difference whether you pay78 or 
78-1/2 or even 79? 
   When 
you 
notice 
you 
are 
wrongly 
committed stop hoping and get out! When 
the move does not come off as expected or 
as figured, get out fast and furiously. Wait 
for the next move.  
   Stop loss orders are once in a while in 
order, especially in wild markets. For 
example, during the sharp wheat drop in 
May 1940, when one was long at the top 
(we were short though!) one had, by all 
means, business to carry a stop around 1.03 
that time. 
   When trading hides don’t watch wheat or 
cotton. When trading in rubber forget about 
butter and eggs or cottonseed oil. Each 
commodity moves its own peculiar way. The 
grains even move their own ways compared 
to one another. Strength in corn may mean 
a decline in wheat at the very same time.   
Watch you own bird! Do not even try to take 
cues from different options! May wheat may 
be weak for an hour and July wheat strong 
at the same time. 
   When an option is about to expire, such as 
September wheat end of August to mid-
September, its fluctuations are more violent 
than earlier. Options that just come on the 
board are usually very little traded. Options 
run about 9 months. In their middle period, 
from the age of 3 to the age of 6 months 
they are best for trading. 
   Margins on commodities run between 
$500 and $750 per contract. Commissions 
vary considerably. On wheat, the round-trip 
of buying and selling a contract or selling 
first and buying afterwards is $12.50. A 
similar contract of lard the round trip is 
$20.00; on hides $40.00. 
   When a top is made and values are about 
to go down-hill we must not only sell out but 
also go short. This question about short 
selling is a ticklish thing with most traders. 
They cannot see the virtue of it. 
   The principle is just the reverse of buying. 
Instead of buying and awaiting higher prices, 
you sell and await lower levels. When prices 
have receded far enough and the time, 
according to the rules laid down here, 
indicates a change of trend, you buy back 
that which you sold higher up and that way 
close the trade. At that very same time you 
also buy. Covering short positions and 
buying at the same time for an upward 
movement is called “doubling up” a position. 
   A phenomenon worth mentioning is the 
state of “lameness” that overtakes traders 
when sharp big moves occur. Some call it 
inability to get out of the seat in the broker’s 
office to give the order. Supposing you have 
figured things out very nicely one evening 
that wheat should advance due to a rule that 
a change of trend is imminent. Instead, the 
market opens down with a small gap. Such 
an unexpected down opening which is 
contrary to what was expected paralyzes the 
man; he is absolutely unable to move, to 
speak, to do anything. He just sits, and 
looks. What has to be done in such a case 
is: get out of the seat and run fast to get out 
at the market when wrongly committed. 
   A similar effect can be noticed when for 
several days a sharp run-up occurs or a 
sharp drop. The client is rightly committed. 
He can’t take those profits and sits still, 
sacredtraders.conm
 
8 
thinking it will keep on going in his direction 
forever. This man is apt to come out with a 
loss instead of a profit since he refuses to 
take profits. A sharp advance of several 
days or a sharp drop of several days calls at 
least for a temporary reversal which enables 
the 
man 
again 
to 
go 
back 
to 
his 
commitments at better prices. 
   All 
the 
above 
remarks 
are 
general 
remarks. I will give you rules and laws on 
hand that will supercede these remarks. 
These rules will give you days and points 
(prices) which, when reached, require you 
stepping out without further ado. 
   Do no trading without having the specific 
chart before you of past performance for 
several consecutive years. It would be just 
as bad as going on a auto-trip without tires 
on the car. Do no chart studies without using 
the ellipse and the rules I shall give you 
along how to set the ellipse. Once a 
commitment has been decided upon, put it 
into execution, especially so, if the past 
cycles are satisfactory. 
   Results depend entirely upon your own 
operation and research, by digging out what 
has happened previously and expect it to 
happen again under similar circumstances. 
This is why it is suggested that you trade in 
but one single commodity or one single 
stock as will e amply illustrated. I have set 
up rules for several commodities; most of 
the rules concern wheat. You will note that 
the rules for hide future price movements 
cannot be well used for wheat, neither can 
wheat price movement laws be applied ot 
hides. Each commodity moves its own way 
just like individuals move each their own 
way. 
 
ASTRONOMY FOR TRADERS 
 
   Before starting in with the rules on 
forecasting we have to get acquainted with 
the various names of the planets and their 
abbreviations. 
We 
also 
must 
know 
something about the Zodiac which is the 
path of the planets.  
 
sacredtraders.conm
 
9 
   The Divisions of the Zodiac into signs and 
degrees.*** ILLUSTRATION NO 1 
   This Zodiac is used for geocentric as well 
as for heliocentric Longitude only. It is not to 
be used for Latitude or Declination. 
   The planets which we use are: 
   The sun ( ) – this planet we use very 
seldom. 
   Mercury ( ) – this is the most important 
planet of all. 
   Venus ( ) – we use this planet very much. 
   Mars ( ) – we need this one for hides. 
   Jupiter ( ) – a few times we need this 
planet. 
   Saturn ( ) – we use this planet only one or 
twice. 
   Neptune ( ) – this planet is used in one 
rule only. 
   Mercury and Sun are called the inner 
planets, the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn 
and Neptune are called the outer planets. 
The new planet Pluto we don’t need.  
   Planets all run around the Sun which is 
their center. Their paths are ellipses, but, 
due to the immense size of each planet’s 
path we can consider them as circles. Each 
circle we know contains 360 degrees. In 
astronomy this circle is used form 0 degrees 
Aries via 1, 2, 3 degrees to 360 degrees. All 
values in Longitude given in the Nautical 
Almanac are shown this way (heliocentric 
values). 
   There is a second way which is used, the 
geocentric division of the Zodiac, if we may 
call it such. It divides the same Zodiac into 
360 degrees also, but makes sub-divisions 
of 30 degrees each, 12 of them, which are 
called signs of the Zodiac. In illustration 
No.1 I show the Zodiac with the 12 divisions 
and the names given to each. Their rotation 
is always the same and never changes. 
Each such sign is 30 degrees long. We use 
this type for our geocentric positions only. 
   Let us assume a planet is at 84 degrees 
15’ 
longitude 
heliocentric; 
this 
would 
correspond to: 2 signs plus 24 degrees 15’. 
The signs are always counted from 0 Aries. 
Thus; one sign covers Aries, the second 
sign covers all of Taurus and the third sign, 
Gemini, covers only 24 degrees 15’ of it. 
Therefore, 84 degrees 15’ is the same as 24 
degrees 15’ Gemini. 
   329degrees7’ would be the same as 10 
signs plus 29 degrees 7’. Ten full signs bring 
us to 0 degrees Aquarius and the extra 29 
degrees 7’ bring us to 29 degrees 7’ of 
Aquarius. 
   To facilitate counting and measuring, I 
entered into the illustration the numbers of 
the sign with Roman numbers form I to XII> 
   You will have to try locating several points 
in the Zodiac the way I showed it above to 
gain experience. We need this very often. 
When values go beyond 360 degrees you 
will come into Aries again, the 13
th sign 
(actually though the first once more). Instead 
of having for example 14 signs you take off 
12 and have 2 and sign No. II is Taurus. 
   The abbreviation of the signs I do not have 
to bring, nor their names, since I have 
marked them in Illustration No. 1 already. 
    
 
PART II 
THE INDIVIDUAL RULES 
 
RULE NO. 1 
SPEED OF MERCURY IN GEOCENTRIC 
LONGITUDE 
 
   WE TAKE Raphael’s geocentric Ephimeris 
for this purpose, looking up page 26-29. the 
value we have to use is given in the second 
last column on these pages. This speed 
changes from day to day. Periodically the 
speed comes to a stand-still. At such times 
the planet moves from a direct motion into a 
retrograde motion or from a retrograde to a 
direct motion, see Illustration No. 2 below. 
The extreme speed of Mercury is 2degrees 
12’, however at times this extreme speed is 
reached at 2 degrees4’. 
   It is advisable to plot this Mercury speed 
on K&E paper through an entire year and 
note the effect of such changes. We obtain 
tops or bottoms. 
 
   **********Illustration No. 2 HERE***** 
 
The Direct and Retrograde Movement of a 
Planet (Geocentric) 
   Examples: July 26
th 1039 low was reached 
when Mercury was at 0. 
   September 15, 1939 peak was at the 
extreme speed of 1degree54’. On May 21-
22 1940 we have an extreme Mercury speed 
of 2degrees12’, heralding a change of trend. 
   Rule: It is advisable to follow the market in 
the direction the day Mercury changes its 
sacredtraders.conm
 
10 
speed. Usually the trend begun at such time 
is good for from 4 days to a week. 
   Using 1940 as a check, we have the 
following 
dates 
as change of speed: 
February 9-10. It was a top and we went 
down until February 14th. The movement 
was a minor reaction of two cents. 
   March 5th, 1940: Mercury at 0. Sharp up 
move for three days, extending nearly 4 
cents. 
   March 15th, 1940: Mercury 57’ speed 
changing to downward again. It was a low 
from which an upmove of 6c came  forth. 
   March 28th, 1940: Mercury at 0. this case 
did not give a clear cut movement, in fact 
considering we had declined two days 
previous already, we would be inclined to 
expect an up move on that change. But we 
sold off slightly. Would call it a failure. 
   May 21st, 1940: mercury at 2:12. Moving 
downward from the 20th also the 21st, called 
for a reversal upward for several days we 
did get. It extended about 4c. 
   The next date is coming between July 7th 
and 8th.. 
   There were five commitments made 
according to this rule up to date lasting 3 to 
5 days. Profits were in four, in one a loss of 
about 2c. Let us figure we did not get exact 
tops or bottoms I would judge that at least a 
net profit of 8-10c should have been 
produced. This in 6 months of operation. 
   It is not a law that gets one rich quick, but 
one in which several contracts can be taken 
and held a few days. When the previous 
movement is down, wheat must be bought 
on weakness of the day; if the market moves 
upward prior to change of Mercury’s peed, 
short positions must be taken on strength 
during the day mercury changes its speed. 
 
RULE NO. 2 
MARS-MERCURY SPEED DIFFERENTIAL 
OF 59 MINUTES 
 
   We use the geocentric longitudinal speed 
of Mars and Mercury given on page 26 to 28 
of Raphael’s ephemeredes. Each time mars 
reaches a point that is 59 minutes apart from 
the Mercury speed we are due for a down 
trend of about three days duration. It does 
not matter whether we have been going 
upward in the trend before. We might have 
been going downward and upon reaching 
this differential, we are heading for further 
down. 
   Examples: January 25, 1940, Mars has a 
speed of 41 minutes, while Mercury has a 
speed in geocentric longitude of 1.40. They 
are then 59 minutes apart in their speeds. 
Wheat had declined before 3-1/2 points. 
From this date (January 25, 1940) we 
declined the same amount once more until 
February 1, 1940, or 3-1/2 points. On April 
30, 1940, mar’s speed is 39 minutes, that of 
Mercury 1.38 minutes. The difference is 59 
minutes. The market had declined from April 
22 four points. From April 30, 1940 on, we 
dropped another four points. 
   June 10, 1940: the speed differential 
between Mars and Mercury geocentric was 
59 minutes. On that day, we opened low and 
ran up wildly 4-1/2c. After further slight 
strength for two days, which brought the 
 
 
 
sacredtraders.conm
 
11 
price up an extra cent above the extreme 
high of June 10, we dropped according to 
this rule and made new lows.  
   In a six months’ period, we have therefore 
three 
cases 
where 
the 
Mercury-Mars 
differential speed of 59 minutes occurred. 
Each time a decline was noted. Each time 
the amount of the decline was about 4c. If 
you check previous years, you will note that 
there is only once a case, on June 3, 1938, 
when the rule failed, and even then we 
reacted two points during the next three 
days. 
RULE NO. 3 
MARS-MERCURY LONGITUDINAL 
DIFFERENCE OF 161 DEGREES32’18” 
 
   While we are at differentials of Mars and 
Mercury, I shall give you a rule that has to 
do with a geocentric differential of these two 
planets. Each time these tow planets are in 
geocentric longitude 161 degrees32’18” 
apart, big solid up moves begin. (This has 
nothing to do with speed!!) 
    Example: April 6, 1935, Mars was at 16 
degrees Libra retrograde (moving backward) 
while Mercury was then at 27 degrees 
Pisces, or 161 degrees apart. A sharp up 
ward move followed. 
   On 
april 
17, 
1937, 
Mars 
was 
at 
5degrees.29 minutes Sagittarius retrograde 
while Mercury was at 16 degrees29’ Taurus, 
or 161 degrees apart. A sharp run-up of two 
days occurred. June 20, 1937, Mars at 19 
degrees 50’ Scorpio and Mercury at 10 
degrees 50’ Gemini, 161 degrees apart. The 
market started a big up move at that time. 
   August 21, 1939, Mars at 23 degrees 58’ 
Capricorn, and Mercury at 12 degrees11’ 
Leo, started the big up move before the War 
began. 
   We note that a distance of 161 degrees 
between the planets Mars and Mercury can 
only occur every two years at a time when 
Mars is retrograde. It takes Mars two years 
to get around the Zodiac. The moves that do 
come off are very strong. 
   The positions of these planets belonging 
to the last case can be found in Raphael’s 
Ephemeris for 1939 on page 17 under date 
of August 21.  
 
RULE NO.4 
MERCURY RETROGRADE POSITION OF 
ONE YEAR AND ITS EFFECT A YEAR 
LATER ON THE SAME DATE 
    
   We use Mercury’s position at the moment 
it turns retrograde. This is only possible 
when we look at it form the earth. Therefore, 
we have to use the geocentric positions as 
given in Raphael’s ephemeris. Rules of the 
kind I give now are very hard to explain in 
words. We have to look into our wheat 
charts and pint out the positions since the 
picture actually talks and shows the effect. 
   On January 23, 1936, Mercury turns 
retrograde at 17 degrees 35’ Aquarius. 
When this point is reached the year after, on 
January 23, 1937, we find that a three days 
rally came in. 
   On January 5, 1937, Mercury becomes 
retrograde at 1 degree 31’ Aquarius. The 
next year, i.e. on January 5, 1938 in spite of 
the rise previous to that date, the market 
rallied further from this day on for three 
days. Thus, we had an up move from 
January 5, 1938 on. 
   On 
December 
20, 
1937 
Mercury 
retrograded at 15 degrees 36’ Capricorn 
which therefore called for a rally on the very 
same day a year later i.e. on December 20, 
1938: actually we made a low on that date. 
We were right to expect an up move. 
   On 
December 
5, 
1938, 
Mercury 
retrograded at 29 degrees 46’ Sagittarius. 
The effect of this retrogradation was to be 
felt on December 5, 1939. We made a gap 
upwards on that day, rather, to be more 
specific, 
between 
December 
5 
and 
December 6, 1939. It was a wild movement 
of nearly 18c before the effect wore off. 
   On November 18, 1939, Mercury went 
retrograde at 13 degrees 58’ Sagittarius. Its 
effect will be felt on November 18, 1940. 
The wheat market from this day on is due for 
a rally of at least three days according to the 
rules given. 
   We note that the dates given are gradually 
moving backwards in the calendar. The 
difference amounts to about 16-18 days 
form one year to the next. Let us check this: 
January 23, 1936  are 18 days backwards. 
January 5, 1937 to December 20, 1937 are 
16 days backwards; December 20, 1937 to 
December 5, 1938 we have 15 days 
backwards, from December 5, 1938 to 
November 18, 1939, we have 17 days 
sacredtraders.conm
 
12 
backwards. So that, it is easy to see that the 
retrograde points of Mercury from year to 
year are retrograding themselves, using a 
rate of about 17 days.  
 
RULE NO. 5 
MERCURY’S RETROGRADE POSITION 
NAD ITS ZODIACAL VALUE AT THAT 
TIME COMPARED TO THE SAME 
MERCURY POSIION A YEAR AGO 
 
   We use the same positions as given in 
rule No. 4 each time planet Mercury turns 
retrograde. Instead of using the date in the 
calendar, we now use the longitudinal 
position of Mercury, which necessarily must 
differ as you soon will see. 
   We follow the longitude of the planet 
Mercury until it reaches the very same 
degree and minute in the Zodiac at which 
place it turned retrograde the cycle previous. 
   January 23, 1936, (see above) shows the 
retrograde position of Mercury 17 degrees 
35’ Aquarius. This very same place is 
passed by Mercury again on February 26, 
1937. this was an important low from which 
a sharp upward move began. 
   January 5, 1937 Mercury retrogrades at 
1degree31’. The year following we run 
across this place on February 9, 1938. It 
was the very top of the year for wheat. 
   The December 20, 1937 retrograde place 
of Mercury find its “echo” on January 23, 
1939. We have a three days upward move 
from then on.  
   December 5, 1938, the retrograde place of 
Mercury gives us 29 degrees 46’ Sagittarius 
on January 5-6 1940. we made the second 
important top for wheat two days before and, 
on that specific day we made a gap 
downward and, a gap, whatever its direction, 
up or down, means the trend is in the 
direction of that gap and never against it. 
   I have not said much about gaps as yet. 
Bear in mind that they are important and 
must not be slighted. A gap upward 
(meaning a space is left open between the 
trading of one day compared to the trading 
area of the next day) indicates strength 
upward. A gap down means weakness. 
Gaps are not always left open; strength or 
weakness may be but for a few days. 
However, when a gap is left open such a 
place must be watched on the charts for 
later use. Invariably at some time such “left-
open” gaps will be closed. We had a gap 
open on December 12, 1939 which was 
closed during the January decline 1940. The 
gaps left open on October 9, 1939 was 
covered during the May drop of 1940. 
   Ellipses oftentimes have to be laid through 
gaps to produce perfect settings. Sometimes 
also a movement jumps out of an ellipse 
with a gap, moves on for a few days, reacts 
and jumps back into the ellipse once more 
and finishes its run within the ellipse to its 
end. 
   November 18, 1939 finds Mercury at the 
retrograde 
place 
13 
degree 
58’ 
of 
Sagittarius. We reach this place again 
between December 18 and 19, 1940. 
   This rule No. 5 is not quite as good as rule 
No. 4 for practical use. 
 
RULE NO. 6 
MARS IN GEOCENRIC LONGITUVE PLUS 
330 DEGREES 
 
   Here is a rule that does not occur very 
often. Whenever it can be used, grand 
results are obtained. We use the position of 
Mars in geocentric longitude and the value 
to be used is 16 degrees 35’. The signs 
which we have to use change from year to 
year backwards. In simper words, we add to 
a value once established 330 degrees. As 
stated above the Laws of Nature are very 
intricate and hard to explain, but when 
looked up on charts and in the ephemeredes 
you can grasp what I mean. 
   We look up the Raphael’s Ephemeris of 
1931. 
   Look at Mars on July 9-10, 1931. the value 
there shows 16 degrees 35’ in  the sign of 
Virgo. The year following at exactly that date 
we had the enormous bear market low of 
stocks within a day. Note, that the sign of 
Virgo was used and no other sign gives 
results, at least not for the year 1932. 
   On July 9-10, 1932, you could buy your 
head off and make monstrous profits. 
   I said above that you had to add to the 
July 9-10, 1931 position exactly 330 degrees 
to arrive at the next important point from 
which to measure. Thus we say: 16 degrees 
35’ Virgo for Mars, the start on July 9-10, 
1931 plus 30 degrees gives 16 degrees 35’ 
Libra; plus 30 degrees gives 16 degree 35’ 
Scorpio, plus another 30 degrees gives 16 
degrees 35’ Sagittarius; plus 30 degrees 
brings us into Capricorn; plus 30 degrees 
gives Aquarius, plus again 30 degrees gives 
sacredtraders.conm
 
13 
Pisces; plus 30 degrees more brings us to 
Aries; plus another 30 degrees Taurus; plus 
30 degrees gives Gemini, plus 30 degrees 
more gives Cancer and once more 30 
degrees gives us 16 degrees 35’ in Leo. All 
told we moved the position of Mars 350 
degrees further up. Then we look in the 
ephemeris for the date on which this 
happens. We find it was on October 18-19, 
1932. A year later we had a big low.  
   As I said we cannot use this day but we 
have to use exactly a year later and find we 
are again at a monstrous low although we 
were just one day late to get the extreme 
lowest 
point. 
An 
18c 
rise 
followed 
immediately. 
   In fairness to my work, going back once 
more to the July 10, 1932 date I wish to say 
that stocks kept on rising as we all recall, but 
wheat did not rise immediately, although we 
may term these few days of early July 1932 
the BEAR MARKET lows. In fact, wheat 
declined down to July 17
th 1932 and then 
got the vast rise. The decline of  these extra 
days amounted to 3c which is nothing to 
worry about, provided one knows that a 10c 
rise follows right thereafter. Anyhow, wheat 
went from 50cnets down to 47c yet. The rise 
was 10c right thereafter. 
   The next date must necessarily be 330 
degrees further in Mars’ motion. To the 
newly found value we have to add yet one 
full year. Thus we use: October 18-19, 1932, 
Mars at 16 degrees 35’ Leo plus 330 
degrees gives us: 16 degrees 35’ Cancer. 
This value was reached by Mars on August 
9, 1934. Add one full year to it, gives us 
august 9, 1935. What happened at this 
time? We were in the midst of a minor 
reaction that began august 1
st 1935. We 
reacted until August 19th 1935 the amount of 
the reaction being 3c just like it happened 
back in 1932. However, we rose after the 3c 
reaction had taken its course precisely 21c. 
From the place we bought, according to this 
law, we rose 18c. 
   Going backwards from Cancer 30 degrees 
is the same as if we go forward from Cancer 
330 degrees. So that for the next point we 
have to take Gemini as sign and the same 
16 degrees 35’ therein. This occurred on 
June 7
th 1936. On that day Mars runs 
through 16 degree 35’ Gemini. A year later, 
June 7, 1937 as per rule, we find ourselves 
at the major bottom for wheat, and even 
then, although it was the bottom, we hung 
around with sharp ups and downs until June 
2oth. This happened in Chicago wheat. In 
Winnipeg wheat we made the low on June 
7-8 and began to move upward without 
approaching the low levels again. Such 
conditions are occurring quite often between 
Chicago and Winnipeg. They should be 
ignored for practical purposes. As said 
before, we are not trying for the last eighth 
but we try for swings. He who bought on 
June 7, 1937 in either market had the 
bottom. 
   The next crucial point lies 330 degrees 
ahead and it is 16 degrees 35’ Taurus which 
was due on April 4, 1938. Add one year to 
this value and get April 4, 1939. It was the 
very bottom form which wheat took a two 
months run upward to June 1, 1939. 
   After this our next date is due when we go 
330 degrees further form 16 degree 35’ 
Taurus. This is 16 degrees 35’ Aries. This 
value is crossed again on January 28, 1940. 
Adding to it one full year, we obtain January 
28, 1941 and you can bet your boots than 
anyone who buys on this day some wheat 
will run into big profits according to this rule. 
   All we have to do to get these pints and 
project from each crucial point, 330 degrees 
and add one year; easy, isn’t it, if you know 
of this as you now do. 
   In this type of work we have to do whit 
points in the Zodiac that have been 
established a year prior. Nothing is there on 
the actual day to make you see the change 
of trend, and just the same it is there, 
invisible, though active. This is the big secret 
of the ancients which they reproduced in 
code form. It reminds me quite often of the 
old Vaudeville show when a fellow pulled out 
of his shirt sleeves a lot of rabbits or doves. 
We could not see them, but they were there 
just the same. 
   It is suggested that your go over this 
procedure very carefully and note how I 
have done it. You may have to work a week 
on it if you have no experience in projecting 
degrees and signs, but you better learn 
these rudiments of astronomy until you 
dream about them since the further we go 
into the subject now, the more we will have 
to count and measure and bring forth 
“invisible” points and make the commitments 
right. 
   As you note, in this rule we have had no 
miss whatever. It worked each year from 
1932 up and it did so further back too, only I 
sacredtraders.conm
 
14 
do not want to bring too many examples. 
Once understood, you do further checking 
backwards yourself and gain experience. 
Remember though, when you go back you 
have to deduct and not add! To get the 1930 
or 1931 date you will have to use the signs 
of Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius etc. in the 16 
degree 35’ position for Mars. 
   This law can also be used for  trading in 
stocks. 
RULE NO. 7 
THE EFFECT OF PERIHELIUM OF MARS 
AND VENUS 
 
We look at page XIX of the Nautical 
Almanac of any year and find a paragraph 
starting with  “Elements of the planetary 
Orbits’. Use the lower list in whose middle 
you find a heading: Mean Longitude of the 
Perihelium. 
This 
is 
what 
we 
need. 
Perihelium means the point where a planet 
is nearest to the Sun; Aphelium means the 
point that is furthest away from the Sun. 
These points lie opposite of each other, in 
astronomical 
expression 
they 
are 
180 
degrees apart. This necessitates on your 
part that your learn by heart the various 
signs that are opposing: Aries opposes 
Libra, Taurus opposes Scorpio, Gemini 
opposes 
Sagittarius; 
Cancer 
opposes 
Capricorn; Leo opposes Aquarius; Virgo 
opposes Pisces. We only quote one half, 
since the other side is just turned around. 
(See Illustration No 1) 
The Perihelium for Venus is given as: 130 
degrees 42’46”.0 
The Perihelium for Mars is given as: 334 
degrees56’9”.9 
This equals in sign to: Venus 10 degrees42’ 
Leo’ and Mars 4 degrees 56’ Pisces. 
The opposite points or the Aphelium points 
of Venus and Mars are at:  Venus 312 
degrees 
42’46”.0 
or 
10 
degrees 
42’ 
Aquarius. Mars 154 degrees 56’9”.9 or 4 
degrees56’ Virgo. 
I have discovered that whenever one of 
these two planets pass its Perihelium in 
geocentric 
longitude 
(also 
over 
the 
Aphelium), we get changes in wheat of a 
few days duration. It means that Venus of 
Mars must pass over its own perihelium. 
The passage over the Perihelium happens 
once a year with Venus, unless the planet 
becomes retrograde shortly after this point 
has been passed. In that case the planet will 
turn 
backwards 
and 
cross 
the 
point 
backwards, then, when it becomes direct in 
motion once more and naturally has to pass 
the point a second time. Mars passes its 
perhelium only once every two years. The 
exception, a treble passage, occurs very 
seldom. 
Venus passing over its Perihelium (10 
degrees42’ Leo) 
Year   Date       Effect 
1935- June 17- at an important low 
1936-July 26-at a good low with strong up 
move following 
1937-June 17-at a good low; strong up 
move develops here 
1938-June 
17-in 
a 
downward 
move, 
however, after dropping 3c more the market 
rallied back to this level as prevailing on this 
day by June 21
st, even exceeded the level 
by two cents. 
1939-August 11-at important low levels just 
preceeding the war rise. 
1940-Sept. 18-19—the effect should be a 
low level. 
Mars passes its Perihelium (4 degrees56’ 
Pisces geocentric) 
Year   Date     Effect 
1932-March 2 in an important top area; the 
range of the day is within a point from the 
actual top. A substantial drop follows. 
1934-Feb. 10- in a top area; we are 2-1/2c 
from the peak. After a few days sidewise 
movement a substantial drop follows. 
1936-Jan. 20-in a sidewise movement; we 
are 3c from the peak and a substantial drop 
follows. 
1937-Dec. 
28-the 
market 
had 
moved 
upward previously and is developing a sharp 
run upward, which amounts to 11c. 
1939-Nov. 
27-the 
market 
had 
moved 
sidewise previously and starts a sharp run 
upward, which amounts to 22c. 
How do we recognize in this case whether 
an up move or a bad down move is coming? 
Answer: -The high which had been made 
just previously, if passed, tells definitely it is 
an up move. Therefore, when commitments 
are made on this rule on the down side we 
have to carry a reverse stop a half point 
above the previous high. 
We have now examined the perihelium of 
Venus and Mars. Mercury’s effect is not 
substantial enough to warrant its use. 
Venus, however, shows that its passage 
over the perihelium gives important lows on 
which to buy. Mars produces it its own 
sacredtraders.conm
 
15 
passage over its own perihelium sharp 
moves either up or down, as we have seen. 
 
RULE NO. 8 
THE EFFECT OF PERIHELIUM BY USING 
HELIOCENTRIC POSITIONS 
 
   We use Venus as example. In rule No. 7 
we had to use the positions given in 
Raphael’s Ephemeris. In the present case, 
we use the positions as given in the Nautical 
Almanac; i.e., the heliocentric positions, 130 
degrees 42’ instead of 10 degrees 42’ Leo. 
Year      Date       Effect 
1937 – March 3 – we are in a strong up 
move; the next day the price drops a 1/2c 
below the March 3 price, then we run up 
20c. 
1937 – Oct. 12 – a low followed by sharp 
ups and downs within a 6c range for three 
weeks. 
1938 – May 25 – a gap down ward, followed 
by an 8c drop. 
1939 – Jan. 5 – a top (Venus at 130 degrees 
42’). 
1939 – Aug. 17 – at this place we reach a 
high point made July 31 previous, run 
through it the next day for a 7c up move. 
1940 – March 29 – a low followed by a 9c up 
move. The low level of March 29 was broken 
by ½ c on April 3, 1940. 
1940 – Nov. 9 – is date of next event. 
   The 
examples 
show 
that 
Venus 
heliocentric passing its perihelium place 
produces strong moves. However, we also 
see that they may be either up or down and, 
therefore, whenever we do use this method 
we absolutely have to work with reverse 
stops. We have better rules to come. 
 
RULE NO. 9 
MERCURY GEOCENTRIC PASSING 
OVER 19*36’ SCORPIO AND 
SAGITTARIUS, ALSO OVER 24*14’ 
CAPRICORN PRODUCES BIG CHANGES 
 
      Whatever the cause may be, why there 
are 
changes 
produced 
when 
Mercury 
passes certain geocentric degrees we do 
not know. The rule gives results. 
   The values are 19*36’ Scorpio and 
Sagittarius, 
also 
24*14’ 
in 
Capricorn. 
Examples:  
   We use now the value 19*36’ Scorpio. 
Year      Date         Effect 
1935 – Nov.22 – a top, followed by a 6c 
drop. 
1936 – Nov. 14 – an important low from 
which a major up move starts. 
1937 – Nov. 7 – a major low for Wheat. 
1938 – Oct. 30 – a top, followed by a 3c 
drop; we are in a bottom area, and the 3c 
drop brought the low three days later. 
1939 – Oct. 24 – we are at that time in an up 
ward movement and the price level of this 
day is at a small reaction low, which is 
broken by 1/2c three days later; and then we 
moved up strongly. 
   We 
now 
use 
the 
value 
of 
19*36’ 
Sagittarius. 
Year    Date        Effect 
1935- Dec. 11. – a low followed by an 
immense gap of 3-1/2c and a top the day 
after. 
1936 – Dec. 3 – in an up move of major 
proportions. 
1937 – Nov. 26 – a major low. 
1938 – Nov. 21 – an important low, followed 
by a 3-1/2c up ward move. The price range 
at that time was narrow. 
1939 – Jan.. 3 – a top. 
1939 – Dec. 30 – a top. 
   We now us the value of 24*14’ Capricorn. 
Year     Date        Effect 
1935 – Jan. 8 – a top – major. 
1936 – Dec. 27 – a major top. 
1938 – Feb. 4 – in a top area, less than 2c 
from the top. 
1939 – Jan. 29 – a top, followed by a 
decline. 
1940 – Jan. 21 – in a top formation followed 
by a 6c drop. 
   While the first two values bring forth 
important changes of trend, the last value 
brings forth all tops in the five years’ period 
tested, which is quite encouraging to make 
commitments upon. 
   The opposing  places bring also changes: 
19*36’ Taurus, 19*16” Gemini and 24*14’ 
Cancer. 
RULE NO. 10 
HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDE OF SATURN 
UNITS OF 1’21”.2 
     
      I have found the value of 1’21”.2; where I 
have it from I do not recall any more. This 
value produces in 1937 the extreme tops 
and bottoms, and if you recall the Wheat 
movements of 1937, you know that it was a 
question of 40c to 50c from a bottom to a 
top, 
or 
from 
a 
top 
tot 
a 
bottom. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
16 
Unfortunately, I have not used that rule any 
farther since I found it on June 6, 1938, as 
my date of entry shows. We shall find soon 
by adding the value mentioned above 
through these years up to date and see 
whether or not it still gives these extreme 
tops and bottoms. 
   We take the Nautical Almanac of 1937 and 
open page 201. In the middle of the page, 
we find a column marked “Heliocentric 
Latitude of Saturn”, given every 8 days. In 
an adjoining column, we have the variation 
of the movement per day. This enables us 
by adding this variation two times to March 
29, 1937, to arrive at the proper Latitude for 
March 31, 1937, which was the top for 
Wheat. 
   March 29, shows that the Heliocentric 
Latitude 
at 
Midnight 
on 
that 
day 
in 
Greenwich 
was 
–2*12’29”.0, 
that 
the 
variation per day was 2”.39. This latter value 
we add twice, and we obtain:  
                     2*12’29”.0 
                                 2”.39 
                                 2”.39 
                     2*12’33”.78 
   To make the work easy, we shall call this 
value 2*12’34”. 
   We also shall add a straight 1’20” instead 
of the very exact value of 1’21”.2 to facilitate 
the work. However, as you will note, in nine 
months’ time we are off a few seconds in 
Saturn’s latitudinal motion. 
March 31 1937 
          
        2*12’34”            top for Wheat in 1937. 
Add:      2’40”  
        2*15’14”          bottom June 7, 1938 
Add:      1’20” 
        2*16’34”         major top July 16, 1937 
Add:      2’40” 
        2*19’14”     major bottom Oct. 7, 1937 
Add:      1’20” 
        2*20’34”   major bottom Nov. 24, 1937 
 
   At this place, we are off six times 1”.2, or 
7”.2 all told. Therefore, the value should be 
2*20’41”.2. To this we add 1’21”.2 which 
gives us2*22’2”.4. The date is January 5, 
1938, which was a top. Adding again 1’21”.2 
brings us to 2*23’23”.6, or  to February 25, 
1938, which was an important top. 
   If we would continue with these values we 
get the following dates: April 28, July 5, 
September 27, in 1938. 
   In 1939, you will note that between June 7 
and June 15 the direct motion in Saturn’s 
Latitude changes direction at 2*29’15”.2. It 
starts to go backward. The motion per day is 
very slow and only by February 27, 1940 do 
we find one of these points crossed. The 
next value backward, by deducting from the 
February 27, 1940 value, we find May 18, 
1940. 
   However, in order to get the in-between 
movements which were very important we 
have to divide our value 1’21”.2 into half, 
and us the value of 40”.6. 
   This we begin to apply from February 25, 
1938, on. Therefore, adding 40”.6 to the 
value of 2*23’23”.6, which is equal to 
February 25, 1938, we obtain 2*24’24”.2, 
which belongs to March 28, 1938, an 
important bottom. 
   There seems to be continuity in this cycle 
which is of great value. 
 
 
RULE NO. 11 
THE 6 INCH ELLIPSE AND ITS USE 
 
   In “Time Factors” I already had put special 
stress on the use of the ellipse. The idea 
about measuring movements with ellipses 
on the charts came to me when I considered 
that planets also move around the sun in 
ellipses. 
   The size of the ellipse which we have to 
use is reproduced here correctly. Be sure to 
reproduce 
it 
on 
Celluloid 
of 
medium 
thickness by going over the contour with a 
pin point to get its picture on to the celluloid. 
Stores that carry drawing materials also 
carry such celluloid sheets. 
   However, when you have completed the 
ellipse do not be in a hurry to separate the 
ellipse or cut it out with scissors, since the 
123* angle of which I shall treat later must 
be drawn into the ellipse picture as shown in 
Illustration No. 3. 
   The two axis also have to be drawn into 
the ellipse; they form often time and price 
resistance. 
   This ellipse was designed for K & E paper 
and does not give results on any other. 
   When you have a chart before you such 
as the wheat chart of 1939 we make some 
trial tests. We set the end of the ellipse 
which I shall mark point X on the important 
lows or highs as they were made. July 25, 
1939 is such a day; so is October 8, 1939. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
17 
Set it there, look forward and note how 
nicely the movement did run within this 
ellipse, until it was abandoned as time 
progressed. The corner of August 30, 1939 
becomes an important point for the position 
of the next top which was made on 
September 7th, 1939. The action of the trend 
may be compared to a ball that runs across 
a roulette wheel, bouncing from one side to 
another in rather weird movements. When 
the “wall” of the roulette bowl is reached, 
which we shall call the “periphery” of the 
ellipse in our case, a movement to the 
opposite side begins the angle of re-bounce 
being different each time.   
   It is suggested that you retain the idea of 
the movement of a small ball in an oval 
roulette bowl, whereby the ball’s movement 
represents the trend taken of the article “ 
wheat, cotton” or whatever we follow. 
Remember constantly, that the wall of the 
roulette bowl makes the ball bounce back, 
unless, that wall is hit with such tremendous 
force that the ball “ jumps” over the wall. 
This very same condition happens in 
extremely wild markets. We call such jumps 
“gaps”. They overthrow temporarily all 
calculations-actually a new cycle begins 
right at this point and new measures must 
be taken from that point on. 
   Once in a while the “jumping” over the 
ellipse is followed by a top right there such 
as it happened end of December 1939 in 
wheat. While it is important to know when 
such jumps occur, they just simply cannot 
be found by setting the ellipse. They must 
be found via our astronomical rules and a 
guess, whether it jumps or whether it does 
not jump over an ellipse does not help us. 
 
******ILLUSTRATION NO.3. HERE** 
ACTUAL SIZE OF 6 INCH ELLIPSE WITH 
ANGLE OF 123* 
 
   The ellipse is more or less a helper that 
locates the exact price level at which 
changes are due on a certain day and 
nothing else. We will find when checking 
through 
a 
few 
years 
that in narrow 
movements ellipses are not of much help, 
although they should be used just the same. 
   This is the way ellipses should be used 
when markets are narrow; set the point X to 
a low, watch the secondary reaction and put 
the periphery into the low point of this 
secondary reaction. The trend would be 
upward as long as the price structure 
remains inside of the periphery. As soon as 
it peeps beyond, consider the trend as 
changed. 
   When the trend is down ward, we reverse 
simply the picture as well as the ellipse and 
using the illustration above we set the ellipse 
into a top first, watch for the secondary 
comeback and lead the periphery of the 
ellipse through this peak of the secondary 
comeback. 
As 
we 
decline 
from 
the 
secondary top we must not cross beyond 
the ellipse but strictly stay inside of it; if we 
do, the trend changes to an up-trend. 
 
sacredtraders.conm
 
18 
   For the setting at point X of the 9 inch 
ellipse we use the low points of a move. 
However, the possibility then exists that we 
can lay any number of ellipses through a 
given point. We have to restrict their number 
by laying the ellipse through previous highs 
or through gaps in case gaps were made. 
These highs or the gaps must not be too far 
away otherwise they are useless. 
   Here is an example which show what I 
mean: Take the low of October 8
th 1939 and 
the previous peak of October 6th 1939. Set 
the ellipse point X at the low of October 8th 
and let the left side of the ellipse run through 
October 6th 1939 and you will have the 
perfect lay of the ellipse, giving you what I 
call the “corner” in wheat November 24th to 
27th 1939. 
 
RULE NO. 12 
THE ANGLE OF ONE HUNDRED AND 
TWENTY-THREE DEGREES INSIDE THE 
ELLIPSE 
 
   Whenever you read a book note that the 
following 
pages 
are 
of 
the 
greatest 
importance: page 40-42, page 70-72, page 
80-82, page 123 and page 144. The gist of 
the story is lying in these pages. This I have 
found out from the study of dozens of 
ancient works. I also discover that exactly 
one hundred pages late rfrom an important 
page you will find ideas explained that are 
very similar to what was said a hundred 
pages previously. This statement I have to 
make since in the works of Confucius and 
Buddha it was so pronounced that, to get 
better explanations of certain pages, I 
merely went 100 pages further and obtained 
much clarification of the page one hundred 
pages before. 
   I have never seen any of the writings of 
Confucius or Buddha in original texts, not 
even pictures of it. But, the printers whose 
job it was to print translations, assembled 
their type in such a way that what I am 
stating above is brought about. Nature does 
that, of course, and the printer Is but the 
innocent tool of Nature. 
   Why and how I struck on the idea to build 
a 123* angle into the ellipse I do not recall 
anymore. I believe it was due to the fact that 
the cycles of the Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions 
geocentric 
(Herschel 
Text 
Book 
on 
Astronomy explains about that very nicely) 
contain 369* and one third of this is 123*. At 
any rate, I set this angle into the ellipse as 
shown in the illustration No. 3. In order not 
to disturb that picture by marking 123, I shall 
put outside of the angle, away from the 
picture the initials SJ, meaning Saturn-
Jupiter angle. The ends of this angle will be 
marked E and F. 
   The settings of  this angle inside the 
ellipse gives very fine results to locate tops, 
bottoms, gaps or what have we. Use point E 
at an extreme low or at an extreme high so 
that the line leading to SJ comes upright into 
a date line such as October 8
th, 1939. You 
will note that first of all the November 24-27 
lows of 1939 are coming to the periphery, 
also that the SJ-F line is jumped over with a 
gap up ward in the middle of the ellipse on 
December 12, 1939. When we have very 
sever movements such as was the case in 
May 1940 in wheat we have to lay the 
ellipse in such a way that line F-SJ is set 
into the coordinate instead of line E-SJ. This 
way we have to lay the ellipse together with 
the 123* angle the long way. 
   Lay line SJ-E through high of April 22, 
1940 and May 10, 1940. this brings the low 
of May 16, 1940 into the coordinate of that 
day and the end point X of the ellipse also 
fits into this day. The real low of 74-7/8 in 
Sept. wheat is from the high of May 10, 
1939 just one ellipse diameter down. 
   Another example of laying the ellipse: 
Wheat 1940, set ellipse at low of February 
1
st. Note how the movement runs in the 
ellipse upward, with a one day exception on 
April 10th, when it moved out beyond by 1/2c 
but jumped into it again the day after with a 
gap upward. Only by end of April 1940 does 
the price abandon the upward trend and 
then, to help the trader, the price remained 
steady for fully four days and only then 
dropped. 
   Experiment around with this 123* angle 
and use in normal markets only the “E” 
setting as explained above. 
   Note: In abnormal markets or at very high 
levels, set ellipse at tops or bottoms at point 
F instead of point E. ( see Ill.  No. 3) 
 
RULE NO. 13 
NEPTUNE AND ITS TRUE DISTANCE 
FROM THE EARTH 
 
   There is a feeling among the public that 
No. 13 is a dangerous number. Hotels 
usually have no number 13 for their rooms; 
sacredtraders.conm
 
19 
they jump from 12 to 14 since the guests do  
not want to use rooms with such a number. 
  I have not selected this number specially 
for Neptune, but as I am taking the data 
supplied here from a pile of cards upon 
which the various rules had been jotted 
down, Nature desired that I just now would 
take the special card that deals with planet 
Neptune in relation to the movements of 
wheat. 
   The rule to be explained uses Neptune 
and its logarithm of the “True distance from 
the Earth”, as will be found in the Nautical 
Almanac on page 221 up. We do not use the 
big number, 1.476 etc., but the daily 
differential or increment found in small 
numbers next to it. 
   When we check 1939 with 1940 for the 
same dates, we find that there is a slight 
progression from one year to the next in 
those numbers. January 1
st 1939 shows 
minus 2411, while January 1st 1940 shows 
minus 2437. This idea is worth while 
retaining since it also shows in other places 
under different conditions again. 
   But, let me concentrate on the law that I 
shall bring forth, how we shall use Mr. 
Neptune to locate tops and bottoms in 
wheat. 
   Here 
it 
is: 
Expect 
changes 
when 
Neptune’s daily motion in its logarithm of the 
True distance of the Earth ( Nautical 
Almanac page 231 up) reaches the following 
numbers: 
   0, 900, 1800, 2340, 2412 and its extreme 
speed, which latter point varies.  
   Note, that the greatest speed in this 
particular motion of Neptune develops at the 
time it changes its sign from plus to minus or 
from minus to plus as was the case on 
March 14, 1939. the motion comes to a 
standstill when its extreme is reached as 
was the case on June 10, 1939. 
   The values supplied above produce mostly 
major changes. They act while moving 
upward as well as while moving downward. 
   Here is what happened when Neptune 
crossed the values given from January 1939 
till now (June 22, 1940). 
2412---January 2, 1939 –   
            top occurred on  Jan 4, when value  
            was at 2373. 
2340--January 7, 1939-same as above. 
1800--January 29,1939- in top range 
                (market was narrow) 
900---February 22, 1939-top 
0---March 14, 1939-bottom 
900---April 4-5, 1939-bottom. 
1800—April 29-30, 1939- 
             a top from which a sidewise  
              movement began. 
2340---may 26, 1939 top of great movement 
2412---June 4, 1939-  we fall out of upward 
                  trend. 
2425---June 10, 1939-  the gap left open  
               between May 24-25 is closed on  
               this day. 
2412---June 17, 1939- the April 29-30, 1939 
                 level is pierced. 
2340---June 26, 1939- a low, followed by a  
               three days rally. 
1800---July 25, 1939-a major low. 
900---august 24, 1939-the sharp pointed 
top. 
0---September 15, 1939 – the important top 
             (2
nd top). 
900---October 8, 1939-the important low 
          from which we shot up 30c. 
1800---Nov 5, 1939-the in between peak 
2340---Nov 29, 1939 –the low of the  
                reaction. 
2412---Dec 
5, 
1939 
–the 
strong 
gap 
upwards 
2495---Dec 18, 1940 –the extreme high of 
           the year 1939. 
2412---Jan 3, 1940-the secondary peak. 
2340---Jan 9-10, 1940-in a down trend. 
1800---Jan 31, 1940- the low of the reaction. 
900---Feb 24, 1940-the high of February 
0---March 15-the low. 
900---April 5, 1940- getting ready for the  
          strong April rise. 
1800---April 30, 1940- we fall out of  
          upward trend just as we did on 
          June 4, 1939. 
2340---May 27, 1940- the rally peak 
           after the sheer drop in May. 
2412---June 6, 1940-a low. 
2424---June 12, 1940-a top 
2412---June 17, 1940 – a low 
2340---June 27, 1940-in down trend. 
1800---July 26-27, 1940- 
900---august 25, 1940- 
 
   Do not thing that this Neptune motion is 
about equal to our Sun motion, with only a 
small shift each year! This would be a big 
mistake. 
   For example, checking the zero value 
which is listed above in the years 1939 and 
1940 on March 14, shifts back in 1938 to 
March 11-12, in 1937 this 0 value is 
sacredtraders.conm
 
20 
between March 8-9, in 1936 we find it on 
March 6-7. the sun has not such motions. 
While we do get important changes when 
the values above quoted are passed, once 
in a while we have to be careful when using 
this method. We get approximately 20 
changes through this method each year. 
Four or even five of them are not important, 
they even lead us wrong unless we get out 
fast; all the others, however, give wonderful 
tops 
and 
bottoms, 
even 
the 
most 
outstanding ones. From the July low of 1939 
each and every value following produced a 
major important change. It did not work well 
during the June decline of 1939 unless we 
consider resistance points which are given 
in the prior May movement. 
 
RULE NO. 14. 
VENUS MOVEMENTS IN GEOCENTRIC 
LONGITUDE USING A UNIT OF 1*9’13”. 
 
   This rule was found by measuring from the 
high of March 31, 1937 in wheat. It is rather 
complicated for practical use, since exact 
measurements must be made with degrees, 
minutes and seconds. If you have difficulties 
to measure backwards with the signs such 
as Aries, Taurus, etc. I suggest to turn the 
signs into the regular 360 degrees of the 
circle calling 0 Aries 0, and 0 Taurus 30*, 0 
Gemini 60*, and so on up. After the addition 
of the units are made, respectively the 
deductions if any, turn them back into the 
regular signs so that you can read in the 
ephemeris when the point is reach. 
   We use the single unit 1*9’13”, also five 
times this unit or 6*55’18” and also five 
times this 6*55’18” unit or what amounts to 
the same, 25 times the original 1*9’18” unit 
which value is 34*36’30”. 
   All the measurements are to be used for 
geocentric longitude only. How I arrived at 
this 1*9’13” value I do not recall. When I 
make tests, I might work two or three days 
on one movement, such as the movement 
from March 31, 1937 to June 8, 1937. 
Systematically all planets are gone through 
in longitude, declination, latitude, geocentric 
as well as heliocentric. The complete length 
from (example): March 31 to June 8, 1937 is 
divided in all possible manner and units 
formed such as the one we use now: 
1*9’13”. I have found a couple more such 
units besides this one that are useful and 
when I come across them on my notes will 
also demonstrate their use. 
   For  this rule we just use this value and 
see what we get.  
   In the beginning of the period which we 
test now, Venus is moving backwards. This 
retrograde movement began on March 28, 
1937. We find this point by looking up 
Raphael’s Ephemeris for 1937 on page 7 in 
the second last column (Venus column 
longitude) near the bottom of the page. The 
value on March 28, 1937 shows 5R49 in the 
sign of Taurus, R is an abbreviation which 
means: moving retrograde. Further on we 
find a letter D (see page 11 under date of 
May 9
th, 1937 in the Venus column in 
Raphael’s Ephemeris). This D means: from 
now on the motion of Venus is again 
forward, i.e. direct. 
   During 
the 
period 
a 
planet 
moves 
retrograde 
we 
have to DEDUCT our 
increment, i.e. the values we use. When the 
motion of the planet is forward we have to 
ADD them. Be sure not to fail on this else no 
results can be expected. 
   It is unfortunate that I have to start with a 
retrograde movement of a planet instead of 
with a direct movement of a planet instead 
of with a direct movement, since it is much 
more difficult to get the idea in your mind 
that way, but there is no other good example 
just now before me. If it is hard to get the 
thoughts clear first, it will be easier 
afterwards. 
An 
hour 
or 
so 
used 
to 
understand the backward movements of a 
planet in the sky gets you a long way. 
   (See Illustration No. 2) 
   Note, that during a retrograde movement 
the planet moves very slowly, only a few 
minutes each day. Therefore, to move 
1*9”13” takes several days. 
   A word of explanation is necessary before 
we go on with our analysis concerning the 
high point of end of March and early April 
1937. There was on top in wheat on March 
29. 
1937; 
in 
hides and many other 
commodities the actual top was on March 
31, 1937. A secondary top was made on 
April 5, 1937. The important question arises 
for us: from which of the tops shall we 
measure with our astronomical values? I 
mostly use March 31, 1937. The April 5
th 
day has not given good results. Of course, 
we might use March 29, 1937 since it was 
the top day for wheat. But, since we have 
used the March 31st date before already, we 
sacredtraders.conm
 
21 
shall 
use 
the 
values 
1.9’ 
and 
6.55’ 
ALTERNATELY from this date. 
 
March 31, 1937 
       Venus at 5*46’ Taurus R. 
                    -6*55’23” 
           gives 28*38’ Taurus OR 
April 16, 1937, the sharp low from which we 
rebounded. 
                      28*38’ Taurus 
- 
1*9’ 
           gives  27*29’ Taurus; 
this was on April 18, 1937, on which day 
there was a holiday, however, April 19th, 
1937, the wheat price range was 6-1/2 c 
above the April 16th, 1937 range. This tells 
us that, if we would not have had a holiday 
on April 16th trading would have been at 
rather high levels. 
                            27*29’ Taurus 
- 
    6*55’ 
         gives          20*33’  Taurus 
                          OR ON  
May 2nd, 1937, on which day we also had a 
top. (Note, that the previous important low 
was just exactly 1*9’ before!!) 
                             20*33’ Taurus 
- 
     1*9’ 
            gives        19*24’Taurus 
 
   Venus does not retrograde that far, but 
stops short three minutes before that place. 
Had we taken into consideration the actual 
point when Venus went retrograde on March 
27, 1937, we would have obtained an exact 
division into 14 parts whereby one part 
would have amounted to 1*9’13”. 
   In the ancient books we find at several 
places references to 14 trees (see “The 
Secrets of Enoch” in Pseudepigrapha, 
Oxford 1913). 
   At any rate, each of the changes that 
occurred from March 31
st to May 9th, 1937 
(Venus goes direct on this day), was 
registered. May 9, 1937 was a low. 
   We now go forward in Venus’ motion by 
adding the values. Of  course, right at this 
point I must bring forth the idea that this law 
gives us intermediate movements whereas 
the planetary conditions that produce major 
movements must never be forgotten. When 
we do count up form the direct position of 
Venus at 19*27’ Aries on May 9
th, 1937, our 
unit of 1*9’13”, we obtain 20*35’ Aries. This 
occurred on May 17th, 1937. this place was 
unsatisfactory in that another shoot followed 
for an extra 1*9’13” which would have 
brought us to the top day, May 20, 1937. In 
rule No. 15 I shall bring a law for Venus 
which tells us about major trends and these 
major trends MUST BE always considered 
FIRST. 
   In order to make you conscious of the way 
the speed of Venus geocentric increases 
and decreases in time, look on page 26-28 
of Ralphael’s Ephmerides where the speed 
of Venus is given for each day. During April 
and May 1937 its speed is very slow and 
four our work we have to use he small 
increments of 1*9’ or 6*55’, whereas when 
we get into the month of June or even into 
July 1937, the speed of Venus is so fast that 
the small increments are even passed in 
one single day. Therefore, instead of using 
on of 5 units we have to use 25 such units or 
34*36’55” from important tops or bottoms in 
order to find a change of trend. Thus, from 
the extreme low in wheat made on June 8, 
1937 we add 34*55’ and we find ourselves 
right on the top, 5*50’ Taurus and measured 
down to the place 
      June 8, 1937, Venus at   3*8’Taurus 
                                           +34*37 ‘ 
    July 15, 1937, Venus at      7*45’ Gemini 
 
   On the surface it may appear here that I 
am trying to circumnavigate the period of 
May 9, 1937 to June 8, 1937. Actually I am 
trying to demonstrate the change that must 
be made from the time Venus starts to move 
direct up to a certain time when its direct 
speed is strong and fast enough to work 
itself away from producing changes at the 
single unit or at the five-fold units (6*55’). 
This is a secret which I have not been able 
to solve as yet. 
   We see, however, that the May 20, 1937 
top, the first tops made after Venus moves 
direct was made when we add two single 
units: Venus direct place is at 19*27’ Aries; 
add twice 1*9’ or 2*18’ and we get 21*45’ 
Aries as the place of change which was very 
good that, according to this method, we are 
unable to find the low of June 8, 1937 never 
mind how we try to combine the units. Yes, 
we can find the low of June 12, 1937 which 
was also a good low of the move, in fact we 
can call this June 12, 1937 low the 
secondary low of the major down move that 
started on March 31, 1937. But, I am not too 
keen to use secondary lows or secondary 
tops. They remind too much on betting 
sacredtraders.conm
 
22 
“place” in races. We only bet for the 1st place 
in all our work. But, we find this June 8th, 
1937 low from several other methods that 
are explained here. 
   Continuing the projection of the value 
34*36’55” which we shall call 34*37’ for 
easier work as we have done before. We 
say: 
   3*8’  Taurus June 8, 1937 
+34*37’ 
     7*45’ Gemini top on July 15. 1937 
+34*37’ 
  12*22”  Cancer Aug. 15, 1937: we fall out 
                of the up trend that started on  
                August 9, 1937. 
+34*37’ 
  16*59’  Leo Sept 14, 1937: at a low. 
+34*37’ 
  21*36’  Virgo Oct 12, 1937: at a low. 
+34*37’ 
  26*13’  Libra Nov 9, 1937 a day after  
                the major low made in wheat that 
                year; gap upwards was made. 
 
   We can see that over a period of many 
months when using this method, we can get 
some mighty fin moves, all of which amount 
to from 6 to 10c within a few days. As I look 
just now at the chart of wheat for 1937, 
especially at the points of change brought 
out through this method, I believe we could 
use a division of this 34*37’ increment of 
three parts. One part would then amount to 
11*32’10”. This is mentioned in case you like 
to delve into this rule further.  
 
RULE NO 15. 
VENUS HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDE AT 
EXTREME AND LEAST SPEEDS FOR 
MAJOR MOVES 
 
   The rule given here is mighty important 
and useful. Wheat acts on this law 
wonderfully. 
Every 
time 
Venus 
in 
heliocentric 
movement 
of 
the 
Latitude 
reaches its extreme speed of 3*23’ and a 
few seconds (the seconds vary a little) or 
else, when it reaches its 0 point, markets get 
unusually active, and traders worry a lot of 
where the market is heading to. 
   I found that a change of trend the other 
way, i.e. contrary to the previous movement 
is due right there and then. 
   Examples: (Nautical Almanac 1937 page 
167) 
YEAR 1937 
January 27, Venus Lat. At 0   a fine low 
March 23, Venus Lat. At 3*23’  a few days 
               Major top; market is boiling wildly 
May 19, Venus lat. At 0  top; (see remark  
           Page 24, 1
st column, 12th line from 
           bottom.        
July 15, Venus Lat. At 3*23’ major top 
September 8, Venus Lat. at 0  a peak  
          Similar to the one of May 19-20, 1937 
November 4-5, Venus Lat. at 3-23’ at major  
           low 
   Venus passes the same points during 
1940 as follows:  
YEAR 1940 
January 1, Venus Lat. At 3*23’ an important  
         peak 
February 24, Venus Lat. At 0*, an important 
         peak 
April 20, Venus at Lat. 3*23’ an extreme  
         peak 
June 15, Venus at 0 Latitude, center of low  
         levels should become low 
August 10-11, Venus at 3*23’ Latitude  
          should become a low 
October 6, Venus at 0 Latitude should 
          become a low 
November 30, Venus at 3*23’ Latitude,  
          should become a low. 
   This rule alone, without flattering myself, 
should enable you to make four trades a 
year, whereby each trade should net you not 
less that 10c. I have not brought other years 
for comparison since we do not want to use 
up pages when the rule given produces 
definitely major changes at such points. It 
does happen that we are a day or two too 
soon and the market runs against us by as 
much as four or even five cents such as it 
did March 23, 1937, but, never worry about 
these few points. You will pick them up 5 
fold a short while later. It is a reversal of the 
previous move that mostly comes forth. In 
1940 it happened, however, that one top at 
0 gave at the extreme another top. 
Therefore, 
“something 
was 
operating 
between the two extremes of January 1
st 
and February 24th 1940 that caused a 
switch. However, let us say that you shorted 
wheat the first few days of January 1940, 
saw it decline to February 1st, 1940 and then 
up again to the old high of January 3rd, 
1940, as it happened on February 24, 1940, 
you could only assume that there was not a 
gap coming upward on February 24th but 
that we have to decline from that place. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
23 
   On the other hand, many of the rules 
showed us already the low point of February 
1st, 1940, pointing thus that February 24th, 
1940 had to be a top and not a “jump-off” 
place with a gap up. Furthermore, should 
you not want to risk a few cents, you might 
even wait a few days to see whether or not 
the market changes as expected and then 
still make the commitments since, as you 
will see form the charts, the movement is 
always a strong move. 
   From what I have said so far and 
explained on hand of the ephemeredes and 
charts, we can see that tops and bottoms 
are made at rather variable times which 
changes depend upon the speed or position 
of the planets. 
   It gets me at times when traders with their 
“private” special methods try to tell me that 
stocks or commodities in their movements 
have to be counted in days, such as 22 days 
one way, 88 days some other  way, 35 days 
this way and 60 days another. It is too silly 
for words. Admitted, in my work “Time 
Factors” I had a chapter dealing with this 
sort of stuff. It was actually foolish to put this 
into the setting. The rules do work once in 
awhile, but it is always the question: when. It 
also remains the question which value to 
use. 
   You can now visualize that, since the 
speed of the various items which we do use 
change constantly, from fast to slow and 
form slow to fast, so that, when we count 
days, we never consider the increase or 
decrease of that speed-and on speed alone 
I have built all the laws given herein. 
Sometimes a planet takes a month to cover 
5 degrees, at other times it takes 3 days to 
do the very same motion. 
   Some readers will have the difficulty to get 
into their mind that for example in rule No. 
15 above the passing of Latitude  by Venus 
of the degrees mentioned produces once a 
top, then a bottom, at some other time two 
bottoms in succession. I do not know the 
reason for it myself, but on thing is sure that 
if it would not have such different effects, the 
public would long be wise to the law of 
regular repetition, but since the effect 
changes irregularly, they walk right over 
these laws and watch news reports that 
invites them to do just the opposite of what 
they should do. 
  
RULE NO. 16 
THE EIGHTY YEARS CYCLE 
 
   As you have found out by now, I have left 
no stone unturned in the attempt to find laws 
that would tell in a safe way when tops and 
bottoms are due to be made in the wheat 
price or in the price structure of other 
commodities as well as in stocks. I always 
was working as a sort of “lone wolf”, hunting 
on grounds which others left untouched. 
Astrologers, with all their angles and aspects 
have to consider so many of them, and so 
often, of whose effects they know little or 
nothing except what they find in text books. 
Not knowing any other approach since 
“versatility” is mainly lacking and everything 
has to go as per rules laid down in these text 
books, they are absolutely helpless. One 
asks the other: what do you think of this 
aspect, what of the other one? While I do 
not claim that all the rules brought forth here 
can be used by you or that you now can sit 
in the easy chair and get each movement, a 
lot of study – and constant study is 
necessary to gain experience for the 
practical application. Some of the laws given 
are a cinch, nothing less. For example the 
Venus Lat. Law should turn out for you to be 
one of the. It will take time until you get used 
to the terms I use until you can quickly work 
with signs, degrees, minutes and seconds. It 
will 
take 
time 
to 
distinguish between 
geocentric 
and 
heliocentric, 
between 
Longitude, Latitude and Declination and the 
other items which we have to use. But, it is 
never tool late to learn these things, 
especially if I can show you that you will 
greatly profit by wearing out a few pants to 
learn it thoroughly. 
   Having lightened my heart a bit, I come 
back to the stones which I turned over. So 
here goes rule 16. 
   I found that, if we can secure old prices for 
wheat or for any other commodity or stocks 
that date back exactly 80 years, and plot 
them on charts, we do find a great 
relationship in the movements compared to 
the present dates. After finding this some 
years ago, I spent a long time in the NY 
Library going back over the old “Financial 
Chronicles” found there and copied  prices 
of what was available. I plotted them on 
charts and may say that some years the 
major  tops and bottoms as well as the trend 
came forth very nicely. I am not saying that 
sacredtraders.conm
 
24 
you will get the market right by just going 
there and copying the values of 80 years 
before, but you will get at least a lot of good 
out of them for checking into present 
conditions. This is specially true when one is 
interested in commodities for which I have 
not given any rules or for which I have only 
given a few rules. 
   Therefore, the movement of wheat during 
the year 1860 should be similar to the wheat 
movement of 1940, that of 1861 from day to 
day in the calendar should be similar to that 
of 1941 etc. 
 
RULE NO. 17 
MERCURY GEOCENTRIC AT 15 
AQUARIUS AND 15 LEO AND THE 
PASSAGE OF ALL OTHERS OVER 
THESE POINTS 
 
   Here is a rule that should not be slighted. 
It entails a little more work than others since 
we have to consult constantly Raphael’s 
Ephemeris and use Mercury in its geocentric 
position. 
   We look in the Raphael Ephemeris of the 
year and pick out Mercury at the moment it 
crosses 15*0’ of Aquarius and 15*0’ Leo. 
Both positions are exactly opposite each 
other in the Zodiac. Take this last remark 
only as a reminder; it has nothing to do with 
what I am going to explain. 
   You will note that very seldom does it 
happen that Mercury at the time given in 
Raphael’s Ephemeris is exactly at 15*0’ of 
the signs we have to use. Therefore, we 
have 
to 
estimate 
approximately 
when 
Mercury is passing exactly, since Raphael’s 
positions are given for noon at London. 
   We note down the values for all the other 
planets as they were at this very moment in 
the Zodiac. Each one of these planets also 
has its own speed and they require therefore 
first an adjustment to bring them even with 
the place at the time Mercury passes exactly 
15*0’ Aquarius ( or 15*0’ Leo). 
   An example will explain the matter: 
   Take Raphael’s Ephemerides for 1939, 
page 17. Look at Mercury  which started 
moving direct a few days prior to its reaching 
15*0’ Leo on August 27, 1939. the value 
given is for noon London on this day as 
15*6’ Leo. In this case, considering that the 
daily motion of Mercury on this day is 56’ 
(figure it out or else look back on page 27 in 
the Ephemeris), a six minute excess position 
does not matter and we can leave it as is 
listed.  
   We take all the other planets on that day 
as they are and get: 
   Sun at 3*18’ Virgo (given on page 16, 
second column) 
   Neptune at 22*20’ Virgo 
   Uranus at 21*58’ Taurus 
   Saturn at 1*7’ Taurus 
   Jupiter at 7*29’ Aries 
   Mars at 24*0’ Capricorn 
   Venus at 0*46’ Virgo 
   Her is the rule now: As Mercury keeps on 
going through the Zodiac and passes the 
places of the other planets given above, we 
get changes of trend. 
   The first place Mercury crosses is the 
Venus place of 0*46’ Virgo which was on 
September 7, 1939 and was that a top! 
   The 
next 
place 
Mercury 
meets 
is 
Neptune’s place of 22*20’ Virgo which as we 
can see from the ephemeris occurred on 
October 19, 1939. We had gone down 
before that day for five days as may be seen 
when consulting the wheat chart. The 
immediate effect was one day run-up of 5-
1/2 points! 
   The next place is hit by Mercury on 
January 20, 1940 which was a Sunday. It 
passed the old place of Mars, 24*0’ 
Capricorn. The 19
th i.e. the Saturday was 
the top. 
   Watch, what else we get! The next place 
that was passed is Jupiter’s place of 7*29’ 
Aries. Mercury runs over this point on the 
very peak day of the year 1940 i.e. on April 
22nd. 
   Watch this next one! Saturn’s place of 1*7’ 
was passed by Mercury at 1*7’ Taurus on 
May 7, 1940 a low with the last small shoot 
to May 10th 1940.. The last planet that still is 
active from the important date of August 27, 
1939 is Uranus. Its place is passed on May 
18, 1940 while Mercury passes 21*58’ of 
Taurus. This was the big wash out low in 
May 1940. 
   Note that the effect runs pretty nearly 8 
months due to the gradual passage of 
Mercury over all points. There was not 
planet that missed to produce a change, 
and, if I may say so, each point was a major 
change not just a quarter point move 
followed. 
   I overlooked to quote the Sun. Its place 
was 3*18’ Virgo and Mercury passed it on 
sacredtraders.conm
 
25 
September 9th, 1939 which gave the bottom 
for the run up to the 15th of September 1939. 
   Isn’t it funny and strange how well Mercury 
remembered to change the market’s trend 
whenever it came to these points.  It did not 
forget about those places in the new year 
1940, but kept right on giving changes. And 
there are people in this world who are so 
influenced that they think “they” down in the 
pit or in Wall Street make price movements! 
Reader, take it once and for all: planets rule 
us and make all the moves for us; they not 
only make the moves for us, but they even 
force us to do so. This was one of the 
reasons why I have decided to release this 
work to you. It will never reach the fellow for 
whom it is not destined. He shall keep on 
working in the darkness where he evidently 
belongs. At some future time it may be 
decided by the planets to let him have it, 
then he will want it all by himself and if he 
should not want it and it be destined to him 
to have it, so force will make him take it and 
swallow it. This hard word is intended for a 
few personal friends of mine who have taken 
my service for many years, bur are jut the 
same believing things of the type spoken of 
above to remind them, should they ever 
study this work, that they once belonged to 
the public whose opinion is far from right.  
  Enough of this. We now go back and take 
a case where we have to make an 
adjustment. We us 15*0’ Aquarius which 
was passed by Mercury between February 
10-11, 1939. On the 10
th of February 1939 
at noon the Mercury position in Raphael’s 
Ephemeris is shown as 14-25’ Aquarius and 
the 11th of February 1939 Mercury’s 
position was 16*7’ Aquarius. Since we need 
15*0’ exactly, we have to figure at which 
time this passage occurs. I do not think it is 
essential to go through all the calculations 
with the proportional logarithms that are 
given on the last page of each Raphael’ 
Ephemeris, unless you want to do it, in order 
to find the exact moment when this occurs 
and adjust all the other planets the very 
same way, but we just say: it is about on half 
of the distance to each side. If we assume 
this as being exact enough for our purpose, 
we also have to do the same way wit the 
other planets. Then planet Venus at the 
moment of Mercury’s passage over the 
15*0’ point of Aquarius is not 4*22’ 
Capricorn, nor 5*27’ Capricorn, but in the 
middle of the two values, or : since the 
difference from 4*22’ to 5*27’ is 1*5’; one 
half is then 31 or 32 minutes. So that we add 
this value to the February 10
th, 1939 position 
for Venus and get as the momentary 
position for Venus at the time Mercury 
passes over 15*0’. We get: 4*22’ Capricorn 
plus 31’ equals 4*53’ Capricorn as the place 
which has to be watched when Mercury 
crosses it. This happens on …this value 
cannot be used since it is behind us, since 
Mercury is already over in Aquarius. We 
eliminate this value altogether.  
   Therefore, we start with the next planet, 
Mars, which also does not give us any help 
since Mercury has passed its place in 
December 1938 already. Next to try for is 
Jupiter. It is on February 10, 1939 at 9*17’ 
Pisces and on the 11
th at 9*31’ Pisces. The 
difference of the two is 14’; one half of it is 
7’, calling for an adjustment of 7 minutes for 
that planet’s place and we get as place to 
watch 9*24’ Pisces. With the slow moving 
planets the adjustment is really not in place 
since Mercury moves very fast, but if we 
once make a rule to do something, we keep 
on doing it so that we get accustomed to it 
and not forget to do it with a fast moving 
planet which would be very bad work. 
   This Jupiter place is passed by Mercury on 
February 24, 1939. It was a top in wheat. 
The movement at that time was very narrow, 
but we just the same can clearly recognize 
this top. 
   Uranus was on the critical day of February 
9-10, 1939 at 14*3’ Taurus. Projected over 
to Mercury, i.e. the day when Mercury 
passed over this degree and minute we are 
on May 22-23, 1939. We darted out upward 
in Chicago wheat on this day for the final of 
4c to make top on May 26-27, 1939. 
 
RULE NO. 18 
VENUS AT 15 AQUARIUS GEOCENTRIC 
USING ELLIPSE 
 
   Certain rules I have to bring which are 
pertaining to the laying of the ellipse. The 
previous rules which I gave about laying the 
ellipse used extreme lows and point X on 
the ellipse, another rule used the 123 
degree angle laying same at bottom or tops. 
   This rule here sets the 123* angle over the 
high made in the wheat price on the day  
Venus passes by geocentric motion 15*0’ 
Aquarius. This setting over the high of the 
day is done when the trend happens to be 
sacredtraders.conm
 
26 
downward; if the trend should be upward, 
then the setting is into the low point of the 
daily range of that day. 
   We have a perfect case on January 6, 
1940, when Venus passes this degree. The 
high of that day in the May option was 1.04 
¼. Set point E of the angle at this point 
downward into the coordinate of this day. 
You then will find that the high of February 
9th and February 13th are inside of this 
ellipse yet, and only on February 15th do we 
leave it with a wild run that brings forth a 7c 
movement by February 23, 1940. 
   The moment it (the price) moves outside 
the ellipse a new setting is necessary to 
follow the ensuing up trend, but how? 
   Here I shall explain the new setting, 
actually a brand new rule which I could not 
touch on before, since had I given this rule 
immediately after the two main rules, you 
would have become mixed up. However, 
assumed that you did some testing and 
setting of the ellipse on the first two rules 
already, you now can understand this setting 
much better and do it right. 
   You take the day we broke out of the down 
ellipse that we started on January 6, 1940. 
This day is February 16, 1940. The low of 
that day in May option was 99 ¼, the high 
was 1.04 ½. You use the short line E-SJ of 
the 123 angle which is inscribed in the 
ellipse and which is 8 ¼ points long (using 
here the chart and calling one square of it to 
be one point) and set this line in such a way 
the 2 points of this angle line stick out above 
and 2 points below the day’s movement was 
5 1/4c. However, let an equal amount stick 
out on either side (vertically). This setting, if 
done right gives you automatically the low 
level of March 18, 1940, the low level of 
April 8, 1940, the lows of April 29 and April 
30
th 1940. It finally gives you the touch-off 
point of May 10th 1940, the last eighth of that 
day touches the ellipse from the outside, 
coming up once more to it, after it had 
broken out on May 1st, 1940. 
   It also gives you on the upper periphery 
the high of February 20. 1940. 
   Actually, 
the 
entire 
movement 
after 
February 16, 1940 is defined in the ellipse 
up to May 10, 1940. 
   Yes, it is of course, much easier to set an 
ellipse when all is over, that is, after a move 
is completed, but look here: 
   The ellipse was abandoned on May 1st 
1940. From this day on we had to look for a 
new way of setting it. 
   Use this very May 1st 1940 and lay the 
ellipse now downward, since we abandoned 
the up trend by falling out of the up ward 
lying ellipse. Set it so that the middle of the 
day’s trading of May 1st 1940 comes exactly 
in the middle of the small line that is part of 
the 123 * angle, similarly as we did on 
February 16, 1940. If done right, the May 10, 
1940 top eighth is exactly on the upper 
periphery of this ellipse. 
   At the same time we also had the regular 
lay of the ellipse in operation by laying the 
small line of the 123* angle over the highs of 
April 22nd and May 10th which vividly showed 
what the market intended to do. 
   We may also us the 15th degree of Leo the 
same way as explained with the 15th degree 
of Aquarius, by applying the same rule 
there. 
 
RULE NO. 19 
VENUS IN GEOCENTRIC POSITION 
PASSING THE CONJUNCTION OF THE 
SUN GEOCENTRIC 
 
   A conjunction means a crossing of two 
planets over the same degree, minute and 
second in the Zodiac. In other words, they 
meet each other when we look from the 
earth towards them. 
   Since Nature makes everything in such a 
way that people won’t notice planets are 
guiding their ways, little or nothing happens 
to markets on the very day when we get a 
conjunction of Sun and Venus. Astronomers 
record such conjunctions very carefully but 
that is all that happens. To us, we are trying 
to see what is the effect of such a 
conjunction upon the trader who buys and 
sells wheat. Is his mind getting affected by it 
towards the buying side or towards the 
selling side? 
   I say and prove the following: 
   Such conjunctions do bring changes and, 
they most always bring important tops, not 
at the very moment the conjunction occurs, 
but like a pinochle player in whose hand falls 
a double Black Jack, it takes him a little 
while to realize that he has them and who 
wants to make doubly sure it is so, it takes 
the traders exactly 1*43’50”.7 in the motion 
of Venus to “knock him out”. You look up 
Raphael’s ephemeredes on page 29 where 
sacredtraders.conm
 
27 
Phenomena are quoted, among whom you 
will find nearly each year the superior 
conjunction, resp. inferior conjunction to the 
Sun. Then go over to the ephemeris, month 
and day when it occurs and measure Venus 
from this conjunction adding to it 1*43’50”.7 
and you will find that most always this is a 
top in wheat. 
   Such dates are:   July 1, 1935 top 
                              July 5, 1936 top 
                              None in 1937 
                              February 9, 1938 top 
                              September 7, 1939 
                                       (wow!) top 
                              June 26, 1940 we  
                                      Declined 
   In 1934, when the conjunction occurred in 
Sagittarius it had produced no change. I give 
this to show that exceptions are possible. A 
much more important factor might have 
been active at that time. 
 
RULE NO. 20 
MERCURY PASING 17*18’27” CANCER 
GEOCENTRIC 
 
   This is a small rule; the event occurs but 
once a year unless the planet Mercury 
happens to be retrograding over it. 
   It is worth about 2  points a year as you 
can check quickly when going over the 
charts. 
   Here is the law: When Mercury geocentric 
passes over 17*18’27” Cancer, we move 
downwards for two days due to such 
passing. This is meant when the planet is 
direct. 
   Sometimes it happens that Mercury after 
passing 
it 
turns 
retrograde 
and 
runs 
backwards 
over 
this 
point. 
In 
such 
retrograde movement sharp up moves occur 
the moment it passes. An example can be 
seen on July 13, 1934. 
   There are also up moves occurring when 
Mercury passes over it by direct motion the 
third time. This point can be anywhere 
between D & R in forward motion. This can 
only happen if it has gone back wards over 
this point first and does not apply to the 
usual yearly passage over this place. 
   Let us for a moment touch a different field, 
that of human beings. The astrological 
magazines make prognostications of human 
beings by using the Sun which rotates 
regularly around. We have not used the Sun 
and will not use it except once or twice. 
   A person who happens to be born at or 
shortly after Mercury passes the above 
named position in Cancer will most likely be 
affected the same way, i.e. with a down 
move, meaning that his life will not be a bed 
of roses, at least not the first few years of his 
life. Now such person can be born in any 
year, and on any day during June, July or 
August since the passage is not depending 
upon a Sun movement of exact regular 
repetition on the calendar such as July 9
th of 
each year when the Sun is passing this 
degree in the Zodiac. The date is fixed by 
the 
irregular 
movement 
of 
Mercury 
whenever it pleases Mercury to reach this 
degree.  
   This year Mercury passed the critical 
degree on June 15, 1940 and promptly, the 
market responded with a drop of 5c before 
anyone knew what happened.  
   Even during periods when the market has 
moved downward already, such as it 
happened in 1938, we get a continuation of 
the down move. We passed the degree of 
17*18’27” Cancer in that year on June 30-
July 1
st and a gap down ward came forth. 
 
RULE NO. 21 
VENUS IN RETROGRADE MOTION 
MAKING A CONJUNCTION WITH 
MERCURY 
 
   This conjunction occurs very seldom, but it 
does occur. We want to know everything 
about movements and thus we register this 
rule as well as the following one which 
occurs somewhat oftener. 
   The result of this conjunction is a strong 
move either up or down, depending upon 
the formation. Consult the ellipse with this 
rule.  
   When we look for this conjunction be sure 
to look first whether planet Venus is 
retrograde. Venus does not like to run 
backwards as often as Mercury, but it does 
so every 1-1/2 years. If Venus retrogrades in 
the Spring of one year, it will retrograde late 
in the Fall of the year after. 
   I shall give you three years of such 
conjunctions: 
   April 8, 1937, a sharp drop followed, 
lasting 8 days. 
   November 7-8, 1938 an up move began 
lasting 8 days. 
   June 12, 1940 a drop began lasting 5 
days. 
sacredtraders.conm
 
28 
   There was no conjunction in 1939. 
   We note that the trend which ensues due 
to such a conjunction lasts from 5 to 8 days 
as the three consecutives cases reveal. In 
order to make sure to catch the right trend, 
we might wait a day or even part of the 
second 
day 
before 
we 
make 
the 
commitment when we use this rule and then 
follow the trend that by that time shows 
sufficiently the direction. Of course, other 
rules will help to find the trend even when it 
starts. 
   NOTE: No rule is given in this case when 
Venus in retrograde motion passes Mercury 
retrograde. I only mean passage of Mercury 
direct over Venus retrograde. 
   
RULE NO. 22 
MERCURY RETROGRADE PASSES 
OVER THE SUN 
 
   This case occurs frequently. The effect is 
a change in trend. The planet must be 
retrograde and not direct in order to give the 
effect. An example is March 15, 1940. 
Hundreds of others can be located by you 
through 
any 
years. 
This 
rule 
works 
practically all the time. These conjunctions 
occur four times a year. When they are due 
to occur can be found under Phenomena on 
page 29 in Raphael’s Ephemeris. They are 
called Inferior conjunction which occur at the 
time Mercury is direct in motion. The next 
one is on July 22
nd 1940.  Another example 
when the resulting movement produced a 
20c rise happened on November 28, 1939! 
Check others yourself and note the results 
so as to gain experience. 
 
RULE NO. 23 
ONE-FIFTH OF A SECOND 
DIFFERENTIAL IN MOTION OF SATURN 
HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDE PRODUCES 
TOPS AND BOTTOMS OF IMPORTANCE 
 
   What is a fifth part of a second to you? To 
the average man such value means nothing 
whatever. It is not even as big as the twinkle 
of the eye-lid. Probably you never heard 
before in your life that measurements of 
such type could have any effect, not to 
speak of, that exact days can be found by 
adding or deducting such a fifth of a second 
and, what is of great interest to all traders, 
bottoms and tops are coming forth with great 
exactness. This is another of the rules 
which, when explained to laymen, who are 
from Missouri, as to the effect of these little 
“Lights” in the heavens upon the human 
brains would make them sit up and take 
notice. As it is, Nature wants them to walk 
around without “Lights.” 
   We use page 221 of the Nautical Almanac; 
in the center of the page we find: 
heliocentric Latitude of Saturn. Next to it is 
the small differential column: variation per 
day given in second and decimal parts of 
second. 0.20 seconds is equal to one-fifth of 
a second.  
   Unfortunately, the values are given but 
every 8 days as the date column to the left 
will show. But this is sufficient for us since 
we can’t do any better. 
   We shall start our examples with the top of 
March 31, 1937. Note that the daily variation 
is negative, working downward and only 
between June 7 and 15, 1939 does it 
change into a positive value. The value 
marked on March 31, 1937 is: 2”.39 and this 
was the top for wheat. We now deduct each 
time 0.20”, deduct, because the value is 
running downward. 
   March 31, 1937- 2”.39 top in wheat 
   June 17, 1937-2”.19 low in wheat 
   August 28, 1937-1”99 low in wheat 
   November 8, 1937-1”.79 big low in wheat 
   January 18, 1938-1”.59 top in wheat 
   April 1, 1938-1”39 low in wheat 
   June 4, 1938-1”.19 low in wheat 
   August 7, 1938-0”.99 we break through 
                         the June low of the year 
   October 10, 1938-0”.79 near the low 
   December 13, 1938-0”.59 at the high 
   February 10, 1939-0”.39 at the low point 
   April 12, 1939-0”.19 at the low 
   June 10, 1939-0”.00 we break out of  
                            up trend definitely 
   On the way up we do not make an 
adjustment on the one-hundredth point, but 
hold on to the same decimal points with 
which we came down; it may come into your 
mind that since we move 0.20 right along, 
we would have to get on the upside now 
0.18, 0.38 etc. which is not right. We keep 
the same scale as testing has revealed we 
must do. 
   Thus: 
August 6, 1939 – 0”.19 (plus) low in wheat 
October 5< 1939 – 0”.39 low in wheat 
   You don’t have to be surprised that we get 
mostly lows in wheat when using this rule; 
know, that it is Mr. Saturn, the Destroyer 
sacredtraders.conm
 
29 
who brings prices down to his level and then 
lets them run up again… 
Nov. 30-Dec 2, 1939 – 0”.59 low for big rise 
Jan 30, 1940 – 0”.79 low of importance 
                                 a low from which

RULE NO. 24 
WHEAT VERSUS MAN 
 
   You may bring up the question by now: 
Why so many rules? Why is it not enough to 
have just one or two rules? Let us state 
once and for all that wheat, cotton, stocks or 
any commodity as far as that goes is as 
complicated a structure as the human being. 
In fact, for our purpose each one of them 
should be considered a living being with a 
will of its own. Under will I mean here that 
“something” which makes it go up and down 
in price. It is caused by planets’ movements. 
Certain planetary conditions will at one and 
the same time cause wheat to rise and 
rubber or cocoa to decline. It may be 
compared to two traders at a time when one 
buys wheat and the other sells wheat. One 
is to lose, the other is to profit by such a 
transaction. 
One 
has 
good 
planetary 
condition for his own body while the other 
has unfavorable conditions at that time. 
   For illustration’s sake we may consider the 
individual rules given here as being rules for 
each part of the body, called in this case 
“wheat”. The functions of each part of the 
body are definite towards producing a 
certain motion.  
   We can show the idea best with an 
illustration. 
   Let us say a person gets up in the 
morning. First, he will open his eyes, raise 
his head towards the clock nearby, looks at 
the time and lays down once more for a last 
minute rest before actually jumping out of 
bed. Once the “jump” is made a brand new 
situation arises. He is up and ready to get 
dressed, ready to go to work for the day. He 
will not go to bed anymore until he has 
completed his day’s work. 
   Let me turn this situation into wheat 
movements. Wheat, let us say, had a long 
decline; it slept. One nice day it stops 
declining, peeps up a little, goes back once 
more but not quite as far as the main low 
level. After a few days it suddenly rushes up 
(look up the movement of wheat from 
August 12, 1939, via August 24, 1939, Sept. 
1
st, 1939 and Sept. 7, 1939). Wheat thus 
took a last minute “nap” before jumping , 
between  August 24 to September 1st 1939. 
Then it jumped out of bed to go to work for 
the bull movement or the day’s work which 
lasted until April 22, 1940. However , the  
big run from September 1st to 7th 1939 was 
enough to make anybody notice it. We may 
even say that between Sept. 7, 1939 and 
November 28, 1939 the person or living 
being called “wheat” had its breakfast; it was 
sitting at a long table, moving sidewise. 
Then, from November 28, 1939 on it got up 
form the table and ran like mad to the office 
with a 20c run to do work there. 
   Once we incorporate life into wheat we 
also can look for the cause that gives this 
life to “wheat” which are the planets. 
   Now, during certain movements of a 
person the feet, the hands, the head or other 
parts of the body are more active compared 
to others. During the time of dressing we 
use our hands to operate with; during the 
passage from home to office we use our 
feet; during office time we use our head to 
obtain results. At all times, however, all parts 
of the body are present, only one or the 
other is actually active while the rest is so to 
say in a semi-dormant state, inactive or only 
partially active. The individual rules which I 
bring here may be considered as parts of 
the being “wheat”. We may, for example, call 
the rule that treats with the Mercury’s speed 
as being the rule that explains the activity of 
“the arm” in a man; some other motion of 
certain planet may be said to represent the 
movements of the feet of a person etc. This 
motion is quite independent of the motions 
of the arms, at the same time both must 
operation and move in harmony. Both are 
constantly present and operating in “their 
own cycles” and once in awhile the arms 
make motions as well as the feet, which may 
be termed a period of great activity with in 
the human body, or, in our case in wheat. 
   Since we are not able with our methods to 
construct a law that tells us at any given 
moment the activity of each and ever 
member of the body “wheat”, we must follow 
the individual members of the body called 
“wheat or cotton” and say: member No. 5 is 
sacredtraders.conm
 
30 
coming to a rest on this day as per rule 7; 
member No. 3 gets active on such a day, 
and in this fashion produce combinations of 
rules which then will produce for us a frame 
or a forecast within which the “body-wheat” 
is forming itself. 
   Several years ago I produced a chart for 
wheat covering the Russo-Japanese war in 
1904-1905. After running in narrow range for 
a long time before this war began, we 
suddenly ran upward strongly some 35c in 
the wheat price structure – this was made 
when the war started. I call this portion of 
the wheat movement ‘the arm”. For the 
duration of the war we held steady at very 
high levels for many months; we actually 
formed in the wheat structure “the body” of 
the person “wheat”. If you examine this 
particular chart, you will even notice the 
breast formation, the place of the “belly 
bottom”, and even the “rear end” was 
formed. After that we formed “the legs” just 
at a time when this war ended and we came 
down to the level where we had started. The 
man was completed, the man “wheat”. This 
idea was discovered form Egyptian writings. 
   During the Spring of 1940 I mentioned 
several times that the present war makes 
the same picture. The arm started on 
September 1
st 1939. the hand with its fingers 
was not even forgotten. You can see them 
from August 12th 1939 up to September 1st 
1939. In 7 days the entire long arm was 
fashioned. September 7th being the high of 
the move, some 25 points above the low a 
week before. After this we formed the body 
of “wheat”. This body formation lasted until 
April 22, 1940. the ups and downs during 
this period represent the outline of the 
important part just as they are arranged in 
an actual human body. The rear end was 
not missing either. It was the period from 
May 1st to May 10th 1940. then we ran into 
the “foot” and what a straight foot it turned 
out to be! The successes of the Axis in 
Belgium ended the mess. So there is you 
repetition of cycles: war –war 1904-1905 
against 1939-1940. Both pictures are so 
alike that if I would set both above each and 
omit the dates you or anyone else would not 
be able to distinguish which is which. See 
wheat chart 1904-0905. 
   This picture of a person is not only formed 
in major cycles such as war cycles, but we 
find it often in small cycles of a month’s or 
two duration, we even find it in charts that 
plot sale to sale prices, in fact it is always 
present. It distinguishes the beginning of a 
move, the run-up, the side-wise movement 
at high levels and the decline which follows. 
The picture may be termed: an open square. 
Three lines, up-line, top line and down line 
form the picture, while the calendar line 
across the sheet forms the fourth line to the 
square. 
   The 
line 
which, 
according 
to 
our 
explanation, forms the “foot line” is not 
always down; it also can be upward so as to 
bring forth bull formations in which case the 
line runs up sharply with a gap, as a rule, 
and 
this 
“footline” 
will 
become 
then 
automatically the “arm-line” of the adjoining 
cycle or square as we called it. 
   Using what has been explained in these 
few lines, we approach now the essence of 
our work. In all our rules we are trying to find 
the “joints” wherein arm and foot are set. 
These points are the tops and the bottoms 
for actual swings or for ensuing sidewise 
movements. As you have seen so far, we 
have rules that tell us only: at this point we 
have to expect a “change of trend”, meaning 
in terms of the present explanation: here is a 
joint of the arm or of the leg; watch, which 
way the joint’s lever is going to run, i.e. the 
attached arm or leg! Since arm and leg have 
a certain length, it is not always necessary 
to buy or sell right within the joint, but we 
may wait a day or two and make sure the 
lever runs in the intended direction and then 
make the commitments.  
   We have other rules, which from testing 
show the direction of the trend quite 
definitely. Oftentimes we even know the 
approximate extent of the movement in 
cents, not to speak of that from other rules 
or even from the very same rules we know 
when such a movement is due to end again.  
 
RULE NO. 25 
THE RULE OF 4-3/8, 8-3/4, 17-1/2 AND 35 
 
   This rule has been carefully explained in 
my work “Time Factors” but for those who 
have not studied it I shall make a rough 
outline of it here once more. 
   Many years ago I noticed that stocks like 
to run in medium sized moves 8-3/4 points, 
in stronger moves 17-1/2 points and in very 
strong movements they cover as much as 
35 points straight through. Low priced stocks 
use 4-3/8 points before turning around 
sacredtraders.conm
 
31 
again. When stocks make a gap up or down, 
the court is started all over. Whereas we 
always take the count from an important top 
or an important low, a gap made during such 
a run abrogates the law, requiring a new 
counting from the gap. The count is to be 
made from the high price of the day 
BEFORE the gap was made and not from 
the low of the day of the actual gap upward. 
In down trend use the low point of day 
before the gap is made to count from. 
   Wheat has a peculiar habit. It moves in the 
above given rhythm too, except that 35c 
moves are very rare, but 30-3/8 points 
movements wind up the cycle. 
   The rule applies for up-moves as well as 
for down-moves. 
 
RULE NO. 26 
GAPS 
 
   Several times I have referred to gaps. A 
gap is a space left open between the trading 
of one day and the trading of the next. Let 
us assume wheat traded yesterday between 
79 ½  and 80 ¾ . Today it trades between 
81 and 82 7/8 which would mean there is a 
gap of ¼ point open, i.e. the space of 80 ¾ 
and 81. 
   Sometimes we get gaps in wheat of as 
much as four or five cents. During the May 
drop of 1940 we had 8 and 9c gaps 
downward, all of which, except the one of 
May 15
th were closed during the same day 
again. The gap left open on May 15, 1940 
will be later on of great importance, since it 
will be closed and after it is closed wheat 
prices should recede from there and not run 
up to the 1.10 level prevailing on May 10, 
1940. 
   In a major movement we usually can 
distinguish 3 important gaps: the gap which 
abandons the down swing (or the previous 
up-swing). 
   The middle gap located about halfway of 
the entire movement, (see gap at 95c, May 
15, 1940). 
   The end gap, a day or two before the end 
of the major move. 
   A gap may occur also at other places; they 
are not very important since most of them 
will be closed and never appear on the 
charts as such.  We may open one day with 
a half cent gap, however, during trading 
hours the market price will cover up such a 
left-open space. 
   At any rate, be the gap covered or left 
open, it is always an indication that the 
market is trying its best to run in the 
direction of the gap and not the other way. A 
gap up is therefore bullish and NOT bearish. 
A gap down is BEARISH and not bullish. 
   Whenever a gap is made I set my ellipse 
into this gap together with the 123* angle to 
see how the picture could develop from such 
a gap. I usually find resistance levels from 
such a gap when, if we set into the gap our 
ellipse, the periphery of the ellipse is 
reached. This means I set the 123* angle 
into the coordinate of that day with the 8 ¼ 
length so that its lower point is falling on the 
high of the day BEFORE the gap was made, 
the angle line running through the day line. I 
hope you understand that in up moves the 
ellipse must always be facing upward and in 
down moves we reverse this and let the 
ellipse run down ward. 
   In order to not overlook any gap which is 
left open I always draw a circle around it that 
later on it still “sticks our” in the chart picture. 
Let me illustrate the reason for such 
markings. Suppose we get into a big bull 
movement. On the way upwards several 
gaps are made. We are riding high upon the 
top waves for a year or two. Then the 
market turns into a bear cycle. The points to 
look for resistance are those “left open” gaps 
of a year or even two years previous. When 
they get closed, (many times exactly to the 
last eighth!), then we have to expect 
reversals of sizable proportion from such 
places. This is also a reason why our charts 
must be kept perfect and not an eighth 
missed when making the entries. 
 
CHANGING FUTURE PRICES ON 
CHARTS 
 
   While we are discussing this subject a 
work about switching futures or options from 
one month to some other on our charts must 
be said. When we plot September futures of 
wheat or some other commodity we know 
that trading ends in September of that year. 
Since we need a continuous flow of prices 
and not, like I have seen brokers’ clerks 
produce one option, then leave a monster 
space and plot the next option to it. This 
space is due to the price variation of one 
option compared to another. On a certain 
day May wheat may be selling 1.03 to 1.06, 
while September may be selling at 99 to 
sacredtraders.conm
 
32 
1.02. Supposing I am plotting just now May 
wheat whose price is given above the 
illustration’s sake is 1.03 to 1.06 and I want 
to switch over into September wheat so as 
to get my continuous flow, I simply call the 
1.03 price from now on 99c and make a new 
scale which is to be used from that time on. 
September wheat is plotted, May wheat is 
eliminated completely and forgotten. This is 
done with other commodities the same way. 
Once in a while it is a little hard to shift from 
one option to another due to the price 
ranges. Let us say, int the above example 
that May wheat is selling on a certain day in 
the range mentioned, but that September 
wheat sells that day between 98 ½ and 1.01 
5/8 . If we would switch and call the old 1.03 
from this day on 98 ½ , we would get 
fractions on our full number line (the cart 
squares) which is not good. In such a case I 
suggest to wait until the options have 
adjusted themselves to a better figure on 
which to switch. It may be but a day or two 
and suddenly one option has strengthened 
or weakened in comparison with the other. 
Then you make your switch. 
   Do not wait until the last few days of the 
life of an option for the switching. The last 
two weeks of an option that expires do not 
give the true movements of the cycle, since 
millers and others who have use for actual 
wheat come into the picture and buy or sell, 
which interference, so to say, causes 
unusual sharp advances and drops during 
that time, while options that are for the later 
dates are not affected. Therefore, options 
should be switched about a month to six 
weeks before the expiration date. 
   The same applies to practical trading in 
options. Never trade in options that are 
about to run out or expire. Use only options 
either three or six months away. This applies 
to all commodities. 
 
RULE NO. 27 
MERCURY’S SPEED IN LONGITUDE 
GEOCENTRIC OF 59’ AND 1*58’ 
 
   Enough 
has 
been 
said 
now 
about 
technical matters. They are very important to 
insure proper application of the astronomical 
rules. 
   The present law deals again with our 
favorite Mercury. 
   It is hard to realize for anyone of “modern 
education” that the Ancients knew all about 
the movements of Mercury, about its effect 
upon the human brains. It is too bad that 
scientists and students of ancient writings in 
their 
notes 
and 
particularly 
in 
their 
introductions stress the fact that these 
ancients 
were 
heathens, 
dumbbells, 
ignorance etc. Why, in the first place do they 
then scrutinize so anxiously these heathen 
works? Why don’t they throw out these 
works and forget about them instead of 
bringing bulky introductions expressing their 
own opinions about things they know 
nothing about? 
   Take it, the Ancients knew Mercury’s 
movement without spy-glasses. If they 
would assume that these Ancients knew 
much more that they themselves will ever 
know, these old writings would begin to talk 
to them. As it is now they are but Pyramids 
and Sphinxes to them.  
   Although I have treated about this idea in 
a special chapter, each time I think of it, I 
just get burning mad about these people and 
have to blur out with a view that possibly 
they would wake up. 
   So let us take Raphael’s Ephemeris again, 
look 
at 
page 
26-28 
and 
follow 
the 
movements of Mercury from day to day in its 
longitude. Its speed ranges from 0 to 2.12. 
In another rule I told you already that 0 and 
2.12 in Mercury’s speed bring changes of 
trend. Now we use Mercury’s speed when it 
is the same as the mean daily motion of the 
Sun in Longitude or double this amount. The 
daily motion of the Sun is 59’; double this 
amount is 1*58’. Each time Mercury passes 
these values we can expect changes of 
trend and, mind you, often times they give 
big tops and big major bottoms. I do not 
mean that we take the Sun and watch it 
when it moves 59’. The sun moves in its 
own 
cycle. 
We 
follow 
Mercury 
only. 
Examples of such passage are: 
   March 16, 1940 bottom in wheat. 
   May 10, 1940 top in wheat. 
   May 26, 1939 top in wheat. 
 
RULE NO. 28 
SATURN’S HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDE 
UNIT 5’46”.15 
 
   We take the Nautical Almanac again, page 
221 in 1939 where we find the column of the 
Latitude. This time we do not use the 
increment, but the latitude proper and count 
from a fixed point, a major  top or a major 
sacredtraders.conm
 
33 
bottom by adding each time 5*46”.15. Since 
the values are given only every 8 days, we 
must interpolate to arrive at the proper days, 
for this purpose we use the side column 
which gives the daily movement in the 
Latitude to facilitate reckoning. When we 
find that the latitudinal motion decreases 
during the years 1934-1935 and upwards 
slowly from a daily motion of 4”.43 to as low 
as 1”.64 (a minus sign is set before all) until 
later on we even reach 0 in this movement; 
then it turns upward to the plus side once 
more. 
   This will explain the fact that in our 
examples which shall  follow below, we 
obtain many changes during 1934 and but a 
few changes in 1937. Under changes I 
mean: changes of trend in wheat. 
   I shall start with January 25, 1934 which 
was a bottom: 
Saturn Lat.             Date            effect 
   1*3’43”.3         1/25/1934     bottom 
  +    5’46”.15 
   1*9’32”.9         4/15/1934     bottom 
          (the figure set down as 1*9’32”.9 is 
the one given in the nautical almanac and 
used so as to facilitate finding) 
 
   1*9’32”.9     4/15/1934 a bottom in wheat 
 +     5’46”.15 
   1*15’15”.9     7/4/1934 a bottom 
 +     5’46”.15 
   1*21’24”.5    9/291934 a bottom 
 
   As we now go over the year 1937, using 
March 29, 1937 the top in wheat, we find 
that Saturn’s latitude on this day was 
2*12’29”.0 and adding our increment of 
5’46”.15 
to 
this 
brings 
a 
value 
of 
2*18’15”.15. This value corresponds to 
September 4th 1937. Looking at the chart, 
we find that the price level for wheat on this 
day is exactly at the half-way mark from the 
extreme top made July 17, 1937 or of the 
one make July 6th 1937. The slowness of the 
motion 
in 
Saturn’s 
latitude 
this 
year 
necessitates 
to 
take 
an 
entirely 
new 
increment which I found to be 2’4”.25 
instead of the one we used in 1934 which 
amounted to 5’46”.15. 
    
   Let us see what we then get: 
    
   2*12’29”.0 
+      2’  4”.25 
   2*14’33”.25     5/19/37 big drop                       
+      2’  4”.25 
   2*16’37”.50    7/17/37 major top of  year 
+      2’  4”.25 
   2*18’41”.75        9/16/37 a low 
+       2’  4”.25 
   2*20’46”.00     11/23-24/37 major low 
 
   Such a sudden change of the size of the 
increment may for the moment confuse you 
and you might say: which is which? Which 
shall be used. Of course, myself I am never 
sure when in this particular rule the 
increment has to be changed. I will tell you 
exactly how I use this rule: I use the first 
increment as long as it brings forth tops or 
bottoms, at the same time, right along I 
measure for the smaller changes, such as 
from March 29, 1937 over to May 19, 1937 
and project this value forward at the same 
time as I throw forward the larger value.. 
The purpose of it all is to produce a 
concentration of several rules at one and the 
same point which then represents a major 
changing point. This May 19
th date for 
example or the July 17, 1937 top day also 
the November 8-9. 1937 day has been 
found in nearly all rules. They showed that 
major changes had to come off on these 
days. Even if you hesitate a few days before 
making commitments, as said at some other 
place already, until it can be clearly 
recognized which way the cat jumps, you 
will have a large number of points left for 
profits, since such movements that result 
from a concentration of rules, on one and 
the same day do not end quickly. Ten, 
fifteen, even thirty cents movements result 
from it. What if 3 cents are missed! 
   I have absolutely no scientific cause for 
the values given above except that they 
were obtained through test only. As the 
value in the latitudinal motion of Saturn 
recedes still more, we no doubt have to 
adjust the value again. 
 
RULE NO. 29 
MOVEMENTS OF SATURN IN 
HELIOCENTRIC 
LONGITUDE OF 34’36”.9 
 
   This method is similar as the previous one, 
only instead of the Latitude we use the 
Longitude of Saturn heliocentric. The values 
are also found on page 201 of the Nautical 
Almanac.

   The results of projecting an increment of 
34’36”.9 from a point such as April 19, 1934 
which was a major bottom, followed by a 30 
cent upward movement, are gaps. Looking 
at the chart of 1934 for wheat, you will find 
that two gaps upward were made, then two 
gaps downward and finally a top.

                       +         34’36” 
7/20/1934          323*53’        a top 
 
   We note that the June 1st top of 1934 did 
not show at all. It is up to you to make a few 
other projections the same way as this one 
was made, using among others a projection 
from the top of April 22, 1940, also one from 
the August low of 1939 so as to reach the 
gaps for the present and coming period. 
 
RULE NO. 30 
VENUS IN HELIOCENTRIC DECLINATION 
PASSING THE EXTREME DECLINATION 
OF THE SUN 23*26’51” 
 
   In this rule we use the heliocentric 
Declination of Venus as it passes over the 
extreme declination of the Sun which is 
23*26’51”. The value can be found in two 
places 
in 
Raphael’s 
Ephemeris 
for 
verification. On page 12 we find in the lower 
part of the page a column of the Sun’s 
declination from day to day given in degrees 
and minutes only. On June 21 and June 22 
the value for it is 23*27’ North. The value 
had been rising previous to it; from then on 
the value declines. It also shows this on 
December 21
st and 22nd of any year, 
however, on these days the declination of 
the Sun is South. The more exact value we 
find 
on 
the 
first 
page 
of 
Raphael’s 
Ephemerides as the Mean Obliquity of the 
Ecliptic, value 23*26’50”.93 (as of 1937). 
   When you check through the various 
planets in the Nautical Almanac in their 
declinations, you will find that all of them 
exceed this value by several degrees. 
   The rule is this: When the heliocentric 
declination of Venus passes the Sun’s 
extreme Declination, we get a change of 
trend. 
   Examples: 
January 7-8, 1938     top 
May 12, 1938           see explanation below 
June 12, 1938           in top range 
October 4, 1938       an extreme low 
November 17, 1938   a high 
November 20, 1939    a low area from which 
                                    We ran up fast 
April 7, 1940               a low followed by a 
                                    fast move up. 
June 12, 1940              a top 
Next crossing occurs in 1941 
   Note: May 12, 1938 caused no change in 
the movement; however, let us look closely 
at this picture. We can see that we had a 
fast run-up of 3/34 cents from May 6
th to 8th 
1938, followed by a sagging movement 
which brought us by May 12 back to the 
level where the upmove had begun on May 
6, 1938. In that the change, according to this 
law, was due not on May 6th but on May 
12th, the prelude, if you may call the rally of 
May 6-8, 1938 such, told us: here is a rally 
for your, so don’t expect any on May 12th, 
1938! At that time we also had just lost one 
half of the entire movement that was to wind 
off from April 19,1938 to June 1st, 1938. With 
this rule we learn another little trick: Eben 
though we do not always know the extent of 
the movement, planetary crossings of such 
kind as treated in this law indicate often the 
halfway mark of the complete move! I 
showed you in some other law such 
condition already. The moment you did see 
that Venus did not bother to produce a run 
up or let us call it a reversal of the previous 
movement, you had fully three days time to 
take back the old short position with not 
more than half a cents loss.  
 
RULE NO. 31 
VENUS HELIOCENTRIC DECLINATION 
REACHING AN EXTREME BEYOND 
23*26’51” 
 
   We look over the changes that are made 
when the Venus Declination heliocentric 
reaches extreme turning points. They can 
occur anywhere, since, when you plot Venus 
Declination on a chart (call one degree one 
square on the chart), you will see that the 
sacredtraders.conm
 
35 
curve produced is a winding up and down 
affair, a regular snake. 
   However, testing of tops and bottoms of 
this curve will reveal that little or nothing 
happens at turning points unless the turn 
occurs above the Sun’s declination, i.e. 
above 23*26’51”. 
   Let us see what happens when Venus 
turns above this value. Use the Nautical 
Almanac again, page 180 and up, second 
column. This column is also used for the 
previous rule. 
23*34’22”  Jan 3, 1938 (extreme) sharp rise 
24*51’ 6”  May 27, 1938 (extreme) major  
                  bottom (made from May 28-June  
                  1, 1938) 
27* 0’27”  Oct 28, 1938 (extreme) a small 
                   top but in bottom range 
   February 15, 1939 cannot be used since 
Venus 
turns 
there 
below 
the 
Sun’s 
declination. 
24*36’36”  Dec 4, 1939 (extreme) gap  
                    upward with strong move to  
                    follow. 
27*19’39”  May 7, 1940 (extreme) two days  
                   final rise followed by the burst. 
   There are no more extremes during 1940. 
   Each test shows up trend of at least a few 
days. 
 
RULE NO. 32 
MERCURY’S GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE 
126*30’ AFTER THE SUN 
 
   This rule is one of the strangest I have 
been able to find. It is very simple, although 
it entails work to project correctly. We use 
the geocentric longitude of Sun at any 
important top or bottom. To this longitude we 
add each time the value 126*30’. When the 
addition has been made and the exact place 
located in the Zodiac, i.e. the degrees and 
minutes and the right sign belonging to 
them, we look when Mercury is going to 
pass this point. Hold fast that day! The 
movement that developed previously at the 
Sun’s place will come off in the same 
direction at the Mercury place. Thus, 
Mercury imitates the Sun’s effect. 
   A few examples will reveal how this works. 
It is one of the best rules. It  was originally 
found on November 17, 1938 laid aside and 
completely forgotten until just now, when I 
checked and rechecked the effects and find 
them 
just 
grand. 
Absolutely 
safe 
commitments can be made so fare as I have 
found. Of course, the duration of the move 
i.e. how long it lasts is something else. I am 
not referring to duration. But, we can say 
that a movement which is incepted will last 
for a week or ten days anyhow, enough to 
make it worth while. Then, when it appears 
from 
the 
chart 
or 
from 
some 
other 
indications that the market acts a sort of 
tired going in that direction, step out and 
wait for another opportunity. I can see at a 
glance that about 8 worth-while moves could 
have been obtained in 1938, by just using 
the 8 important tops and bottoms of that 
year and projecting them 126*30’ forward. 
   Examples: 
   1938 Sun Position reached by Mercury on 
April 19           28*46’  Aries 
                    + 126*30’ 
                       155*16’ or 5*16’ Virgo  
                                                   Oct 10 
June 1st             10*19’ Gemini 
                     + 126*30’ 
                         196*46’ or 16*49’ Libra 
                                                   Oct 21 
June 21st            29*26’ Gemini 
                      + 126*30’ 
                         215*56’ or 15*56” Scorpio 
                                                     Aug 1 
   This law I dug out of the Hebrew Talmud. 
   Thus: What the Sun does, Mercury does 
the same 126*30’ later. We only apply this 
rule from extreme tops and extreme 
bottoms. The effect is felt only several 
months later and not a few weeks later. The 
April 19th top in 1938 was followed by a long 
decline. So it also happened when Mercury 
moved over the zodiacal point lying 126*30’ 
further over. This was August 1st, 1938. See 
what a swell decline developed from there! 
   Coming now over to the present time, we 
measure once from the big top of December 
18, 1939. Sun position was on this day at 
25*40’ Sagittarius. Adding 126*30’, we get 
2*10’ in Taurus. We look in Raphael’s 
Ephemeris of 1940 and find this day is May 
8, 1940. The top was on  May 10, 1940 and 
not on May 8th, 1940. We had a Sunday on 
the 9th of the month and on Monday, May 
10th, 1940, we shoved up four full cents yet. 
I cannot explain away this extra day, 
although I try very hard as you may see. 
However, the rule says what the Sun does 
before, Mercury does after. The Sun caused 
a top on December 18, 1938 and a decline it 
was to be from May 8th on in 1940. The 
“false move” which made that extra one day 
sacredtraders.conm
 
36 
run belongs more into my rule of “the Man 
who completes his frame and should be 
considered as such. Anyhow, he who did 
use the rule is give here and sold on May 
8th, 1940 was not sorry. 30 cents is a good 
profit to pocket. 
   There is a small matter to discuss yet, at 
least to draw your attention to. We know that 
Mercury  moves at times retrograde. Should 
that measurement coming from  the Sun 
reach Mercury at the time it moves 
retrograde, we have first a place over which 
it does move direct and only after that does 
Mercury retrograde and pass over the same 
Sun projection of 126*30’ and again after it 
turns direct it must pass the same spot 
again. I never have had occasion to rest the 
effect back years. The results ought to be 
interesting. 
 
RULE NO. 33 
MARS IN GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE  
PASSING 16*55’46” CANCER 
 
   This rule can be seldom used, since it 
deals with Mars whose movement around 
the Zodiac takes nearly two years. However, 
each time Mars passes 16*55’ in Cancer a 
movement begins that is worth following. 
The effect over several years was thus: 
   August 10, 1934 a major top. 
   July 20, 1936 an important low. 
   July 2, 1938 a gap downward and much 
lower. 
   June 13, 1940 a top and down sharp 
 
   It would be helpful if you would keep a 
calendar book using one page for each day 
of the year, wherein you note all projections 
and places at which changes of trend have 
been figured for into the future. Use one rule 
after the other, figure their next points of 
change and their effect if available and enter 
each one found or located into the proper 
date of the calendar. Add to it the number of 
the rule it was taken from since otherwise 
you can do not re-checking at the proper 
time. Each day consult this diary.  
 
RULE NO 34 
VENUS DAILY VARIATION OF 
HELIOCENTRIC LONGITUDE PLUS OR 
MINUS 7 SECONDS 
 
   Here is a rule that brings fine results, 
although it is hinged on a movement whose 
differential is but a mere seven seconds. 
   I would like to give some sort of an 
illustration on practical life to demonstrate 
the value of seconds, especially that of 
seven seconds, but as much as I think, I 
can’t find any relationship. In practical life 
such small units do not count.  
   We shall take the Nautical Almanac on 
page 187, first column. In this column the 
movement of the heliocentric longitude is 
listed every two days. In the adjoining 
column we find the variation of this longitude 
from one day to the next. This value we 
have to use for this rule. 
   The values all run in very narrow range 
from 1*34’50” to 1*37’32”. It is a constant 
swing up and down, up and down within the 
limits given above. What can anyone get out 
of these small numbers? How can we find 
tops 
and 
bottoms with it? In wheat 
especially, when newspapers tell us each 
day that it is the “export demands” and the 
hedge-selling of millers…One of the two 
parties is wrong. 
   The rule as formulated says: 
   At each side, seven seconds from the 
extremes of the values of the heliocentric 
longitudinal daily motion of Venus are 
changes of trend to be found.  
   Since the extreme points are changing 
slightly by second or so each time a round is 
completed we have to measure each time 
again to make sure of the exact value. 
However, roughly, the values are: 
   1*34’50”+7” or 1*34’57” 
   1*37’32”--- 7” or 1*37’25” 
   There are two possibilities, one while 
approaching the extreme values and one 
while receding from it.  
   Examples: 
1*37’ ( August 11, 1939 a mojor low  
            1*37’25” and September 6, 1939 
           end gap up for the windup peak 
           Sept 7, 1939) 
1*34’ ( April 4, 1939 major low from which 
           strong move developed and May 4,  
           1939 top from which strong  
           sidewise move of a week came  
             forth) 
sacredtraders.conm
 
37 
1*34’ ( Nov 14, 1939 low level ready for 
          sharp rise and Dec 14, 1939 day  
          before a gap upward, in fact, it was 
          the end gap in that move, similarly 
          to the Sep 6, 1939 gap. Previous gaps 
          were: gap of Oct 9-10, 1939, begin of 
          move. Middle gap of Dec 4-5, 1939. 
          See remarks page 33 gaps) 
1*37’ (March 23, 1940 minor top area and  
          April 18, 1940 major top within 7/8  
          points; may also be considered as 
end 
          of gap.) 
1*34’ (June 26, 1940 to be reached here 
and  
           July 26, 1940) 
1*37’ (Nov 2, 1940 and Nov 28, 1940) 
 
RULE NO 35 
VENUS IN ITS EXTREME SPEEDS IN 
DAILY VARIATIONOF HELIOCENTRIC 
LONGITUDE 
 
   This rule might be included in rule No 34. 
However, I purposely separated it, since the 
rule does not work in combination, meaning 
a low at 1*34’57” does not imply that the 
extreme explained here MUST produce a 
high or e a high at 1*34’57” MUST bring a 
low. 
   The wheat market is in for a change of 
trend when Venus reaches in its heliocentric 
Longitude’s daily motion the extreme and 
least speed. 
   It is remarkable and absolutely unknown to 
most people that a motion of a planet which 
is actually always forward and never 
retrograde could contain within such forward 
motion 
a 
rhythmic 
acceleration 
and 
retardation. It may be termed a “hidden 
motion” 
   The places to be watched are 1*34’50” 
with a decimal attached and 1*37’32” with a 
decimal attached. 
   Examples: 
(1*37) Jan 12, 1939 small top (we move in 
narrow range just then) 
(1*34) April 18, 1939 the last low before the 
upswing. 
(1*37) Aug 24, 1939 the sharp peak day 
(1*34) Nov 28, 1939 begin of major advance 
to Dec 18, 1939. 
(1*34) July 11, 1940 to be reached here; 
expect this to become a drop down day. 
 
RULE NO 36 
SUN-MERCURY CONJUNCTIONS PLUS 
60* IN GEOCENTRIC POSITIONS 
 
   In this rule we attempt to make a 
combination of a “foot-arm-head” movement 
as explained in the rule about “Man”. 
   The low of May 18, 1940 for example wa 
hit on the dot; so was the low of November 
8, 1937 among many others. 
   Conjunctions 
of 
the 
interior 
planets, 
Mercury and Venus are of two kinds; the 
superior conjunction, when the planet is 
direct moving as it crosses the Sun and the 
inferior conjunction at which time the planet 
is retrograding over the Sun. 
   We take a conjunction of Sun with 
Mercury, whether direct or retrograde. The 
positions are found in Raphaels Ephemeris 
under the heading Phenomena, page 29.  
However, after we have located the day of 
the conjunction, we have to look up the 
degree and minute when the conjunction 
occurs, such as the one of March 15, 1940, 
which, after we first locate it on page 29 of 
Raphael, we go back to page 7 and find 
under date March 15, 1940 that this 
conjunction occurred a little beyond 24*26’ 
in the sign of Pisces. 
   However, we are not interested in this 
case what happens at the moment of the 
conjunction. This is treated in another rule. 
We add to this place or position of Mercury 
(not of the Sun) an additional 60 degrees 
and get thus 24*46’ Taurus. 
   We look up when Mercury passes this 
place. It happened exactly at the low point 
May 18, 1940. Thursday, March 15, 1940 
gives May 18, 1940. 
   In my notes I have the following statement; 
Conjunction plus 60*. 
   The superior conjunctions of Mercury with 
Sun, i.e. when Mercury crosses the Sun 
while direct in motion produce mostly tops. 
   Whereas Inferior conjunctions plus the 
added 60* gives major turning points also 
gaps. 
   But this is not all yet! The notes say 
further: 
   From the place which is 60 degrees from a 
Mercury conjunction such as May 18, 1940 
you transfer your attention to the planet 
Venus and see where it is located just then. 
We find that Venus is on that day at 7*35 
Cancer which value necessarily has to be 
adjusted to correspond to the adjusted 
sacredtraders.conm
 
38 
24*46’ Taurus of Mercury. The noon position 
has not this value. It shows 23*19’ Taurus. 
With Mercury we are about 1*27’ shy at 
noon May 18, 1940. The speed of Mercury 
on this day is 2*7. We have to add two-thirds 
of this motion so as to arrive at the exact 
conjunction projection of March 15—acting 
on May 18, 1940. We have to proceed the 
same way with Venus, since we intend to 
project from here the movement of Venus 60 
degrees further. 
   Venus moves from May 18 to May 19, 
1940 from 7*53’ to 8*26’ in Cancer or 34 
minutes. Two-thirds of this amount (as we 
adjusted with Mercury) is 22 minutes. 
Therefore, adding 22 minutes to the noon 
position in the ephemeris  gives us the 
correct position for Venus at the moment 
Mercury is exactly 60 degrees from the 
previous position of Mercury conjunction 
Sun on March 15, 1940. 
   To this value 7*53’ Cancer plus 22 
minutes or 8*15’ Cancer we add also 60 
degrees which brings us to 8*15’ Virgo 
which equals October 9, 1940. When Venus 
reaches this place, a change of trend is due 
in wheat. 
   However, the original conjunction of Sun-
Mercury has not ended its usefulness at this 
place. My notes say that we have to add to 
this latter place of Venus another 12*. When 
Venus arrives at this place +12*, we are due 
for the final change of trend which was 
caused by the conjunction Sun-Mercury of 
March 15, 1940. The day is October 24, 
1940. The position of Venus on this day is 
20*15’ Virgo or 8*15’ Virgo +12*0’=20*15’ 
Virgo. 
   This rule is rather difficult to follow through 
right. Remember that 4 separate steps are 
made; 
1) locate the conjunction of Sun-Mercury 
2) project Mercury 60* beyond this 
conjunction 
3) use Venus from the latter place and 
project also 60* 
4) continue with Venus by projecting it an 
extra 12* 
 
RULE NO 37 
SUN-VENUS CONJUNCTIONS PLUS 60* 
 
   This rule is on the same basis as rule No 
36, only we use the conjunction of Sun to 
Venus direct as well as when retrograde. 
   Step No. 1 = Locate the conjunction Sun 
Venus. 
   Step No. 2 = Add 60* of Venus’ motion to 
this conjunction point and expect a change 
of trend in wheat. 
   Step No. 3 = Look for Mercury where it is 
on this specific day and run it 60* further 
from this place and expect again a change 
of trend.  
   Step No. 4 = From this point let Mercury 
run an extra 12* and get the last change of 
trend that is caused by the Sun Venus 
conjunction. 
   Conjunctions of Mercury to Sun occur 
rather often, while Sun Venus conjunctions 
are rare. We can easily see that when using 
this method and the previous one together, 
we get numerous date changes during a 
year, which are overlapping. The Sun-
Mercury conjunction of March 15, 1940 ends 
its effect only by October 24, 1940. Other 
conjunctions had begun in the meantime.. 
   Special Note. From the time of Sun 
conjunction Mercury on March 15, 1940 to 
the very end of its effect, October 24, 1940 
Mercury moved exactly 240* forward in the 
Zodiac and is found at the same degree and 
minute but in another sign (Scorpio). 
   We omitted projecting Mercury after the 
first 60* projection and used Venus instead 
by projecting it first 60* and then 12* all told 
72*. 
   This is not a mere coincident. It may be 
said that it constitutes the action of the feet 
and of the arms of a man, when the feet are 
moving and the arms inactive, they are 
carried along, since they are attached to the 
body. 
   Have we so far said a word about mildew, 
wheat rust, about crop reports, dust storms? 
Don’t worry, we won’t say anything about 
them in this work! 
   In order to show the rule once more on 
another example, I shall us the Sun Mercury 
conjunction of March 25, 1937 and go step 
by step, denoting the effects at the same 
time. 
   Sun-Mercury conjunction March 25, 1937 
at 4*45’ Aries. Add 60* in Mercury gives 
4*45’ Gemini, top June 16, 1937. From here 
on use Venus which on June 16, 1937 is at 
about 10*20 Taurus.  
2) add in Venus movement 60* gives 10*20 
Cancer; top August 13, 1937. 
3) add an extra 12* in Venus movement 
gives the low of August 24, 1937.

   When 
you 
do project a few such 
conjunctions 
the 
procedure 
gets 
quite 
mechanical, but, to explain the steps was 
hard and, what was still harder, how I found 
these steps originally. This was first found 
on August 2, 1938, from “Legends of the 
Jews”, vol. 11, page 27. 
 
RULE NO. 38 
MERCURY LATITUDE HELIOCENTRIC 
 
   In the present rule we shall use the 
heliocentric Latitude of Mercury. 
   We find it on page 171 in the Nautical 
almanac. On the surface it seems as if 
nothing much could be done with  this 
Latitude since it moves form 0 up to 7*0’ and 
down to 0 again. However, I have left no 
stone unturned in the attempt to put 
everything 
possible 
and 
impossible 
to 
practical trading use. So did I with this 
Latitude.  
   There are four values in this line which 
bring forth changes of trend: These values 
are: 
0, 3*21,6*42, and 7*0’. The inside values are 
effective on either side, on the way up also 
on the way down. 
   Some mighty fine tops and bottoms are 
produced when Mercury in this motion 
passes the above mentioned degrees. 
Check them on past or recent performance 
and you will say yes, it is so. 
   Just look at the January high 1940 and at 
the February 2-3 low in 1940. Some times 
the effect is not very pronounced, but it is 
present 
just 
the 
same. 
During 1938, 
especially during the first half of the year 
practically all the changes registered on this 
one rule alone. 
 
RULE NO. 39 
VENUS, VARIATION PER DAY OF THE 
HELIOCENTRIC LOGARITHM OF ITS 
RADIUS VECTOR 
 
   We use the Nautical Almanac of 1937 on 
page 169 and find a column which bears this 
heading. However, instead of using the 
actual logarithm, we use the daily variation 
of same as found in the adjoining column in 
very small values. 
   In Nautical Almanac of 1940 the values 
are found on page 187. 
   The rule is: 
   Wheat makes bottoms or occasionally 
tops when the values of this daily variation 
reach their extremes. 
   Examples: using the wheat performance in 
1937. 
March 1, 1937 log-13  a low 
April 26, 1937 log-828  a low 
June 22, 1937 log-0  the big rise began 
August 18, 1937 log-832  top 
October 13, 1937 log-0  a low 
December 6, 1937 log-832  a high 
   When using this law you must not think 
that you have to figure with logarithm Tables 
from now on. Everything has been figured 
for you. All we apply are the numbers as 
shown in the book. In fact, by now you will 
have recognized that it  does not matter to 
us whether or not we know what is a 
logarithm, a declination, or a latitude etc. as 
long as we know specific numbers under 
certain headings must be used. This is the 
reason why I have not bothered much giving 
explanations about the meaning of the 
expressions. 
True, 
we 
must 
not 
be 
completely ignorant on the subject, although 
at times “Ignorance is Bliss”. We see this 
when we consider the many astronomers 
who can figure all the numbers given in the 
Nautical Almanac but don’t know what to do 
with them in practical application to markets. 
 
RULE NO. 40 
VENUS HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDE 
DIVIDED INTO PARTS 
 
   This rule is intended to make you find the 
very small moves in wheat lasting only a few 
days. However, since we nearly always 
have to do with bottoms, tops, and gaps-
either one- and the changes explained here 
come one after the other, we must be in a 
position to watch the actual performance of 
wheat at very close distance. 
   We turn to page 167 and up in the 
Nautical Almanac of the year 1937 or to 
page 187 in the year 1940. In the center of 
the page we have our column; Heliocentric 
Latitude of Venus. 
   We note the values vibrate between 3*23 
and 0*, going from plus to minus to both 
extremes. 0* is the center of the vibration. 
   I have discovered that the following values 
within this vibration give changes, on the 
plus side as well as on the minus side. They 
miss occasionally one of the values, but, as 
said, we must be at the board to watch the 
sacredtraders.conm
 
40 
sales and prices. My notes say: there are 17 
values in the entire cycle movement, 8 on 
each side of the zero point. In my tests I 
found that one miss occurs (i.e. nothing 
happens) in one entire cycle. 
   Here is the rule: 
   Changes of trend for minor moves occur at 
the following Latitude points of Venus when 
Venus passes over it; 
0*0’       2*30’ 
0*13’      3*00’ 
1*50’       3*17’ 
2*17’       3*23’ 
   If you should decide to use this rule, 
remember that the values in the Almanac 
are given for Venus Latitude only every two 
days which requires interpolation with the 
aid of the adjoining column )variation per 
day) so as to get the exact time the values 
quoted above are passed. 
 
RULE NO. 41 
MERCURY’S DAILY SPEED IN 
GEOCENTRIC LONGITUDE 
 
   We have treated this subject already. 
However, I just now come across a notation 
which must be registered and known. It 
deals 
with 
Mercury’s 
daily 
speed 
in 
geocentric motion, covering the time its 
speed is more than the Sun’s mean motion, 
i.e. when Mercury’s speed is more than 59’ 
per day. 
   It also deals with that phase when Mercury 
in its motion is less than the Sun’s daily 
mean motion of 59’. 
   This is what my notes say: 
   When Mercury’s speed has reached the 
extreme 2*4’-2*12’ it has to turn downward 
trying to get to zero. 
   Once in a while it does not do so 
immediately 
but 
stops 
somewhere 
in-
between 2*12’ and 0’ and accelerates again. 
It is satisfactory if this occurs below the 
Sun’s mean motion of 59’, but it is very bad 
for wheat if such a change of speed occurs 
while the Mercury speed is still above 59’. 
   For example, Mercury hits the extreme 
speed in the daily geocentric movement 
(2*12’) and comes downward in this speed 
to 47’ or 50’, then turns up say to 1*20’ 
speed per day. This would be perfectly right. 
But, should it come down from the extreme 
say to 1*40’ and reverse upward, it would be 
ruinous. In this case it would have stayed 
above the Sun’s mean motion and ran back 
up again. 
   A condition as important as the previous 
one is this:  
   As Mercury in its daily speed comes up 
from zero, crosses the Sun’s mean motion 
of 59’ and continues for awhile, but then, 
instead of making for the extreme 2*12’ it 
turns down; this would be ruinous again. 
Compare Mercury’s movement August to 
October 1937. 
   Once, the Sun’s mean speed is passed, 
Mercury just simply has to go to its extreme 
speed, 2*12’ or 0’; if not, watch out! 
 
RULE NO 42 
VENUS REDUCTION TO ORBIT. 
VALUE + 2*42’ 
 
   When we go out fishing, at times we are 
satisfied with very little ones! That is, if we 
can’t get big ones… 
   Here is a “small” rule which does not have 
to be used often since it is not happening 
often. However, if it does happen you can by 
wheat for at least two days. The crossing of 
Venus in the “Reduction to Orbit, value + 
2*42’ is the critical point. This implies that 
the direction of market just prior to this 
crossing might be downward or it might be 
upward. On this day you can buy the 
market. The value of the Reduction to Orbit 
(see column 2 in Nautical Almanac of 1940 
page 187) must be increasing in speed, i.e. 
the value must be heading towards the 
extreme and not downward. 
   Examples: 
   February 16, 1937 we rushed up for two 
days. 
   Sept. 28, 1937 we rushed to a top. 
   January 18, 1938 we rushed to a top. 
   May 11, 1938 a sharp two day run up. 
    
   As I am writing this and check the charts 
at the same time to make sure of the effects, 
I note a very important law. 
   This value + 2*42’, whenever it occurs, 
comes just at a moment when traders are 
asking themselves: is this the beginning of a 
serious upmove? Actually, as I look at the 
charts I can see that traders, if they are 
short previous to this point, run all to cover 
right after the point is passed; they get 
scared and the market runs fast and furious 
upward for two days. It is suggested that you 
dig up several other such points and mark 
sacredtraders.conm
 
41 
for future use any such places in your diary 
so that  you do not act like the masses who 
think: here comes a rise, whereas only a 
sharp two day move develops, followed by a 
similar type of reaction. I consider this rule 
very good, and it is a pity it does not occur 
more often. 
   In 1940 we find the first crossing of this 
value on March 15th, the next one on July 5th 
and the following on August 31st. 
 
RULE NO. 43 
VENUS HELIOCENTRIC LATITUDES 0*, 
2*16’, AND 3*23’ 
 
   In this rule we use the heliocentric Latitude 
of Venus once more. We distinguish 
however, between the signs of plus and 
minus that precede the figures. The effect 
varies.  
   During the year 1938 the following 
sequence was noted: 
February 9 = 3-6’ minus while value is 
descending                                (top) 
March 25 = extreme 3*23’38” minus (top) 
April 19 = extreme 0          (top) 
May 31 = 3*6’ plus ascending   (bottom) 
June 15 = extreme 3*23’38” plus (top) 
July 17 = 2*16’ plus descending  (bottom) 
August 11 = extreme 0  (top) 
   We use two odd values aside of the two 
extreme values. They are 3*6’ and 2*16’. 
These values we change alternately, that is : 
we skip one each time. On the way down 
between Feb 25 and March 25, 1938 we 
skip 3*6’. On the way up, between April 19 
and May 31, 1938 we skip 2*16’ and keep 
on alternating that way. 
 
RULE NO 44 
MERCURY HALFWAY RETROGRADE 
PLACE 
(SEE ILL NO 2) 
 
   Mercury 
can 
only 
be 
retrograde 
in 
geocentric 
longitude 
and 
never 
in 
heliocentric longitude.  
   The amount of retrogradation of Mercury 
varies considerably as you can see by 
checking periods during which it is moving 
retrograde.  
   The rule here concerns only the retrograde 
movement and centers specifically on the 
halfway point from the moment Mercury 
turns retrograde to the place where it moves 
again direct. We figure the difference of 
these two places in the Zodiac, divide by two 
and look in  the ephemeris (Raphael’s) for 
the date when this halfway point is reached. 
   My check covers the following places 
May 11, 1937   a bottom 
Sept. 13, 1937  a bottom 
Dec 30, 1937   a bottom 
April 22, 1938  was a miss in that nothing 
                          Occurred. 
   Example of how the figuring is done. We 
use March , 1940. Mercury turns retrograde 
on March 6, 1940 at 0 Aries 15’. It becomes 
direct on March 29, 1940 at 16 Pisces 51’. 
Therefore the difference between these two 
values is 13* 9’ (30* Pisces equals 0* Aries, 
less, 16*51’ Pisces) plus 0*15’ or 13*24’. 
One half of this value is 6*42’. This value is 
then either deducted from the place Mercury 
begins to move retrograde or else we can 
add it to the other side (to the value of 
March 28, 1940) 16*51’ Pisces. 
   Both  ways we obtain 16*51’ Pisces plus 
6*42’ equals 23*33’ Pisces which was 
passed by Mercury on March 16, 1940 and 
we see from the chart that it was the 
important low. 
 
RULE NO 45 
PRICE LEVELS OF WHEAT 
ESTABLISHED WITH LOGARITHM OF 
THE PLANETS TRUE DISTANCE FROM 
THE EARTH 
 
   For the first time, we have a rule that 
throws some light upon prices. So far, 
everything that was produced ignored price 
levels altogether. All obtained was days of 
change of trend. In terms of mathematics we 
had exercises in pure Algebra, whereas in 
this rule we use Arithmetic. The former 
allows substitutions of any price, while the 
latter works with actual prices. 
   Rule: When any one of the planets, from 
Mercury 
over 
to 
Neptune 
(each 
one 
individually of course) changes its logarithm 
of the True distance from the earth (see 
Nautical Almanac at the proper headings for 
each planet), we are just midway of a 
movement. 
   I shall illustrate three cases and supply the 
prices for them. The examples are taken fro 
the Winnipeg wheat chart, but Chicago will 
act in the same proportions, since we have 
to do here with a universal law. 
   Example No. 1 Mercury (Nautical Almanac 
1938 page 144) 
sacredtraders.conm
 
42 
On March 30, 1938 the True distance from 
the Earth of Mercury (the daily variation of 
same is used) shows a value of 26695, its 
extreme speed. We only use extreme speed 
in this case. We consult our Winnipeg wheat 
chart and find that the low of this day was 
1.22 1\2. The movement had come from 
1.15 1\2 on March 22nd, 1938 thus, we 
already had a rise of 7 cents. 
The high that was reached ultimately on 
April 8, 1938 was 128 ¾ or in other words, 
we rose exactly the same amount once 
more (1/4 point excess). The value or rather 
the day when the planet reached its extreme 
speed in the daily variation of the True 
distance from the earth (March 30, 1938) 
was the mid-way point of the swing. 
On March 30, 1938 the extreme speed in 
True Distance from Earth of Saturn was 0. 
We have to call a zero speed also an 
extreme. Both planets, Mercury and Saturn 
were active during this time. 
On May 5, 1938 Uranus comes to such a 
critical point, to a 0 daily variation speed. 
(Nautical Almanac 1938 page 204). This day 
happened to be a holiday and no exact price 
can be had. We can judge, however, from 
the performance of wheat around that day, 
that its price must have been in the October 
option around 88 cents. The previous top 
had been made on April 19, 1938 at 1.01 
and thus we had passed 13 cents up to this 
day on the downside. As I said above, the 
rule is that the changes of speed are made 
when price levels reach the half-way point of 
a movement, we have to expect that from 
this specific day on we are to decline 
another 13 cents, the date of such a low 
does not interest us in this rule but only the 
price level. The low for October Winnipeg 
was made at 74 end of May 1938. The 88 
cents price less 13 cents would have given 
us 75 cents and this was within one cent of 
the low. 
   June 24, 1938 Mercury is at 0 (459 plus 
against 935 minus). The price of October 
Winnipeg is 85 cents. We came down from 
89 ¾ cents. We had covered a distance in 
price of 4 ¾ cents, therefore, the price 
should recede to 80 ¼ cents, which it did. It 
went lower after holding this level for about 
10 days. 
 
RULE NO. 46 
VENUS REDUCTION TO ORBIT; 0*, 1*50’ 
AND 3*1’ 
 
We use the Nautical Almanac page 167. 
Use the following positions in regular 
rotation 
and 
project 
repeatedly 
and 
constantly forward. 
 
-1*50’ 
 0* 
+1*50’ 
 3* 1’ extreme          (in reduction to 
-1*50’                        Orbit of Venus) 
 0* 
+1*50’ 
3* 1’ extreme 
    
At the extreme of 3*1’ of this reduction to 
Orbit value we are occasionally a day or 
even two days to soon. However, the actual 
price differentials of the succeeding days are 
not too much. 
   Special Note: Between –1*50’ and –2*58’ 
we get sharp drops and between –2*58’ and 
–3*1’ we get sharp reversals very often. 
 
Examples: 
April 4, 1937 to April 17, 1937 
April 17, 1937 to April 20, 1937 
 
May 30, 1937 to June 13, 1937 
June 13, 1937 to June 15, 1937 
 
July 26, 1937 to August 9, 1937 
August 9, 1937 to August 12, 1937 
 
November 14, 1937 to November 28, 1937 
November 28, 1937 to November 30, 1937 
              (upmove kept on) 
 
March 7, 1938 to March 21, 1938 
March 21, 1938 to March 25, 1938 
    (upmove was small) 
 
June 27, 1938 to July 10, 1938 
July 10, 1938 to July 14, 1938 
 
   The first period given above produced 
down moves, the second period given above 
produced up moves as per the rule. No 
place 
where 
the 
values 
had 
to 
be 
considered was “jumped” in order to make 
the goings easier such as I have seen of 
dozens of traders who have “pet methods” 
which, whenever they don’t click are just 
sacredtraders.conm
 
43 
passed over on the sly, so as not to 
incommodate their feelings. 
   We must realize that the planets work is 
exact and, if they don’t work at certain 
places, it is due to some more important 
condition 
prevailing 
that 
nullifies 
that 
particular minor one. All those rules given 
where not flaws occur are of the greatest 
value and should be separately marked for 
constant use. After all, we are tackling the 
hardest problem any human being could try 
for, measuring movements of commodities 
ahead of time! Other people, in fact the 
multitude 
of 
people 
call 
trading 
in 
commodities 
an 
outright 
speculation 
whereby the end is usually a “strip dance” 
which with one lasts longer, with another 
shorter. 
   Our “speculation” is basically sound, and, 
even if we have to take losses once in 
awhile, 
the 
profit 
side 
i.e. 
the 
right 
commitments overweigh by far the short 
comings. 
We 
are 
surely 
not 
fooling 
ourselves when we decide to eliminate 
everything that is gossiped in the “street”, 
everything that newspapers have to say, 
everything that the public craves for. 
 
RULE NO. 47 
MERCURY REDUCTION TO ORBIT OF 
PREVIOUS YEAR USING EXTREME 
VALUE OF 12’52” 
 
      This rule has only to do with the actual 
extreme value in the Reduction to Orbit of 
Mercury which value is 12’52” or close to it ( 
slightly variable).  We merely look them up 
in the Nautical Almanac of the year previous 
and make a list of them. Then we use the 
dates on which  they occur the year LATER. 
Examples: 
January 10, 1936          July 19, 1936 
January 25, 1936          August 6, 1936 
February 12, 1936        Sept 5, 1936 
March 13, 1936            Sept 30, 1936 
April 7, 1936                Oct 15, 1936 
April 22, 1936              Nov 2, 1936 
May 10, 1936               Dec 1, 1936 
June 9, 1936                 Dec 27, 1936 
July 4. 1936 
 
   On all dates given extreme positions are 
found.  
   Look up the very corresponding dates a 
year later, i.e. in this case in 1937 and pick 
our your tops and bottoms; we have 17 
positions according to this rule and not less 
than 14 of them brought MAJOR CHANGES 
the next year. 
 
RULE NO. 48 
JUPITER IN RIGHT ASCENSION, 
DIFFERENTIAL OF 1h 21m 45s 
 
   This is a rather curious rule. Due to the 
fact that the motion in Right Ascension is 
also retrograde, we have periods when 
nothing is due for a long time. The example 
given below, starts at an important peak. We 
may also begin with some other major top or 
bottom that was formed within some other 
cycle and not belonging to the one 
examined. Thus, we can start from such 
days as June 1, 1938, April 22, 1940 etc. 
   Example: 
   Top, Dec 28, 1936 Jupiter R. A. at 
18h25m25s we add constantly the same 
increment of 1h21m45s and get this way the 
following dates and changes: 
   April 5, 1937 (19h47m10s top second 
peak of major top) 
   Nov 25, 1937 (same value: 19h47m10s 
major low) 
   Feb 22, 1938 (top in wheat major) 
   Jan 25, 1939 (a top in wheat) 
   April 4, 1940 (a low in wheat) 
   July 11, 1940 (is the next date belonging 
to this series) 
   We end herewith the rules to measure 
movements of wheat.  There are still a few 
notes left which, however, are either so 
complicated in their construction, or their 
value is doubtful. Several times I struck on 
rules which in the first instant looked 
wonderful and did give tops and bottoms for 
awhile like a clock strikes twelve. When 
projected into other years on the same 
principles they just simply faded out. None 
of these have been used, in fact as I 
carefully scanned each card on which the 
notes had been registered, I tore up all 
those that looked doubtful, cleaning house 
at the same time.

PART III 
RULES FOR HIDES 
THE COMMODITY HIDES ALSO 
APPLICABLE TO STOCK MARKET 
 
   One point movement in Hides represent 
$4.00. 
   Trading in hides is very profitable. Hides 
move their own way and have nothing 
whatever to do with wheat. Hides may be 
bullish and run up a hundred or two hundred 
points, while wheat moves during such 
period sidewise in a narrow of two cents 
range. It may take nose dives. It might follow 
hides part of the way and then end back 
where it had begun, while hides keep on 
moving up. (Stock traders please substitute 
the word “stocks” whenever the word hides 
in mentioned). 
   We don’t have to be so careful anymore to 
clarify the reasons for such conditions. It is 
simply planetary movements that make 
them move differently. What we use as rules 
for wheat do not come into question for 
hides at all, except, one or two of the rules 
have a tinge of showing some tops or  
bottoms for hides. 
   Of course, for forecasting hide prices, we 
can’t use anything else but the same 
planets, the same longitude, declination or 
latitude as we did for wheat. However, we 
have other proportions of values as shall be 
amply demonstrated. 
   There are not as many rules for hides and 
much less still for other commodities, since I 
have devoted most of my time towards 
finding wheat laws. However, all rules that 
are given for other commodities have been 
worked and tested just as carefully as the 
wheat rules. Some give striking results and 
hit major tops and bottoms uncannily. 
 
RULE NO. 1A 
VENUS, DAILY VARIATION OF 
LOGARITHM RADIUS VECTOR 
 
   The least and extreme speed of the 
logarithm of Venus Radius Vector (Naut. 
Alm. Page 169) bring major changes in 
Hides. The extreme value is about 828 to 
832. 
    Examples: 
January 5-6, 1937 (825 Bottom in Hides) 
March 1, 1937 (0 Bottom in Hides) 
April 30, 1937 (826 Bottom in Hides) 
June 23, 1937 (0Botom in Hides) 
August 19, 1937 (832 Bottom in Hides) 
 
February 2, 1938 (0 Bottom in Hides) 
March 31, 1938 (830 Bottom in Hides) 
May 25, 1938 (0 Bottom in Hides) 
July 20, 1938 (top) 
September 13, 1938 (Bottom in Hides) 
November 9-10, 1938 (top) 
   When the price movements just prior to 
Venus reaching the extremes of the log. Of 
the Radius Vector have been on the way 
down, you can buy hides on the day the 
extreme is reached. 
   Note: The value of 488 of this Radius 
Vector gives also good results for minor 
moves. 
 
RULE NO. 2A 
VENUS LATITUDE HELIOCENTRIC 4*58’ 
(4*52’) DIFFERENCES 
 
   Measure from important tops or bottoms 
by using Venus in heliocentric position. 
Project from such tops or bottoms the value 
of 4*58’. During certain periods I found that 
4*52’ would be more advantageous, but the 
difference is so small it is not important. 
   Examples: Adding to the low of December 
30, 1937 which was –0*4’52” and figuring 
via the extreme of 3*23’ on 2/24/1938 our 
value of 4*58’ in Venus Latitude we reach 
March 31, 1938 the low. 
   From the March 31, 1938 low to May 31, 
1938 low are again 4*58’. It is suggested 
that your project the value from each top 
and bottom of importance. 
   The difficulty which you might encounter 
with this method is that you have to do your 
figuring upward first to the 3*23’ place and 
then measure the amount that the planet 
has to go yet so as to make ultimately 4*48’. 
The remaining differential must be deducted 
from this 3*23’ extreme speed. The same 
applies when the movement of the planet in 
Latitude is downward at which period we 
deduct first the amount to get us to 0 and 
then take this value off the 4*58’. The 
difference found this way is then applied and 
added to the 0*. A little effort, going over the 
two examples above will clear the situation. 
Besides, similar calculations have been 
used in other rules already.

RULE NO. 3A 
MERCURY CONJUNCTIONS TO SATURN 
AND JUPITER OF 80 YEARS AGO 
 
      This rule does not only cover Hides, but 
applies equally to other commodities, also to 
stocks. 
   We have to obtain back Ephemerides for 
those years of Raphael, else we might use 
the Max Heindl Ephemeris for this purpose 
which can be had in stores that sell 
astrological tools. The Macoy Publishing Co. 
at 35 West 32
nd Street, New York, N.Y., has 
them. Their price is 25 cents each plus 
postage of 3 cents. Their arrangement and 
layout is a little different compared to 
Raphael’s Ephemerides. However, I doubt if 
Macoy has enough old Raphael’s to go 
around. There is another possibility which 
you might consider. I have a set of German 
Ephemerides, 3 volumes, covering a full 100 
years from 1850 to 1950. The price on thin 
paper is about $ 17.50. You might want to 
get those and use them for any period. 
   Here are few “Highlights” of this 80 year 
cycle to show what can be had by 
searching. 
   We 
concentrate 
on 
the 
Mercury 
conjunctions to the various planets. 
    July 18, 1857 Mercury conjunction Saturn 
gave top July 18, 1937. 
   April 23, 1858 Mercury conjunction Jupiter 
gave top of April 23, 1938. 
   May 28, 1856 Mercury conjunction Saturn 
gave a top to Hides and a major low for 
wheat form which big movements resulted. 
   The first two conjunctions quoted when 
they returned in 1939 gave minor bottoms 
from which rallies of four days duration 
came forth. 
   The dates are: June 24, 1939 for Jupiter 
and July 14, 1939 for Saturn. We must 
remember that during this period, especially 
in wheat we were in a major downtrend and, 
this downtrend was only interrupted at these 
two places and nowhere else as you can 
readily see when consulting the chart. 
 
RULE NO. 4A 
MERCURY 80 YEARS AGO 
 
   We 
use 
the 
geocentric 
ephemeris, 
concentrate only on Mercury as it passes 
through the Zodiac.  We mark each day 
when this planet enters a new sign 80 years 
ago, i.e. when it arrives at 0 degrees. We 
also mark those days in which Mercury turns 
retrograde or direct. Note, that a planet 
changing 
signs 
and 
going 
direct, 
respectively retrograde are two entirely 
different things, but for our work they fit 
together. Here is a list of these places 
together with the dates when they happened 
back in 1857. These dates are to be carried 
over to the year 1937, exactly 80 years 
further according to the Sun’s motion and 
not according to Mercury’s motion. 
   All quotations are for Mercury only. In this 
example the years 1857 and 1858 were 
used. 
1857 –equals 1937    1858 –equals 1938 
3/31  0 Aries              1/6 retrograde 
5/20 retrograde           1/26 direct 
6/17 direct                  2/13  0 Aquarius 
7/23  0 Leo                 3/6-7  0 Pisces 
10/10 direct 
         3/23  0 Aries 
11/22  0 Sagittarius    4/6  0 Taurus 
   Each and every one of these positions 
gave 80 years later  tops and bottoms not of 
a few points but of from 50 to 200 points in 
hides. 
   Look up the dates on the hide charts. 
   Note: The very same calendar days are 
used 80 years later. 
 
RULE NO. 5A 
MERCURY HALF-WAY POSITION 
BETWEEN RETROGRADE AND DIRECT 
 
   This rule we have used already for wheat. 
It also can be applied to hides and stocks. 
(see rule 44). 
 
RULE NO. 6A 
MARS DECLINATION HELIOCENTRIC, 
19*51’00” 
 
   From the Nautical Almanac, page 191 up 
we find the apparent Declination of Mars. 
We use in this only the value 19*51’. We 
locate these days ahead of time and expect 
tops and bottoms to appear  there.  
   Example: 
March 28, 1937 (bottom) 
June 17, 1937 (bottom) 
November 22, 1937 (top) 
February 2, 1939 (bottom) 
October 20, 1939 (top) 
March 25-26, 1940 (bottom area) 
July 13, 1940 (next change) 
   These cases happen twice or three times 
a year.

RULE NO. 7A 
MARS RIGHT ASCENSION  19h20m 
DIFFERENTIAL 
 
   In this rule we use the Right Ascension of 
Mars and project form a previous major top 
or a bottom 19 hours 20 minutes. The 
results ae fine. We can commence to do this 
also the other way around by measuring  
backwards and see what has happened, 
expecting it to happen again. I have a good 
reason to say this specially, since I have 
found the cycles even in small daily jiggles 
repeat of I trace backwards. 
   There is apparently one flaw to this rule. 
What shall we do when either side of the 
points traced is moving backwards, i.e. 
retrograding? 
   This statement may not mean anything to 
you so far, but what was said is important. 
With an example we will find quickly what I 
mean. 
   The picture prevailing 19h20m prior to a 
date measured in Mars Right Ascension 
should repeat in continuation. 
   The picture lies about one and one half 
years behind. 
   Example: 
January 3, 1940 equals May 10, 1938 since: 
Mars R. A. Jan 3, 1940 is    38h58m a top 
                                           -19h20m 
Mars R. A. May 10, 1938      4h38m a low 
                                           +19h20m 
Mars R. A. Dec 26, 1939     23h37m a low 
 
   It does happen that we obtain a low when 
the previous point was a high or visa-versa, 
but seldom. He who uses this rule will watch 
the movement from one day to the next and 
thus he will quickly notice a change of 
behavior as the paralleling cycles move on.. 
   However, there is a time, as stated above, 
when Mars goes backward for a period in 
Right Ascension as it happened between 
June 24, 1939 and August 25, 1939. During 
this time we may try to retrace back wards 
the effect, but it won’t work right. The best 
for us to do is to pass up such a period 
without getting us into troubles. (see 
Nautical Almanac for 1939 page 194 and 
196). 
   This rule has yet proven to be the best of 
the lot. 
 
RULE NO. 8A 
MARS RIGHT ASCENSION 11h20m 
DIFFERENTIAL 
 
   This is another rule based upon the same 
principle as the rule No. 7. We use again 
Mars; Right Ascension, but go back to look 
for a cycle of  11 hours 20 minutes. January 
27, 1940 is equal to December 5, 1938, both 
of which were lows. December 18, 1939 is 
equal to October 24, 1938; both were big 
tops. 
   The way this rule works can be best 
demonstrated when we take our two hands, 
put them in front of us, a foot apart nd a foot 
away from the face. Hold each steady; then 
begin at one and the same time to trace 
wavy curves up and down, proceeding 
towards the right side. The left hand 
movement represents the movement of 
Hides that are plotted in the previous cycle 
which is back either 19h20m or 11h20m in 
Mars’ Right Ascension motion and the right 
hand represents the present, which retraces 
the past movement. The rule does not give 
price levels nor does it register the size of 
the movement except approximately. 
   The scare of which I wrote at the bottom of 
rule No. 7A is herewith removed, since, 
when Mars in the 19h20m movement bucks, 
i.e. moves retrograde we simply use the 
cycle of 11h20m. 
 
RULE NO. 9A 
MARS RIGHT ASCENSION AT FULL 
HOURS 
 
   This rule misses occasionally an hour, but 
at whichever hours it shows a response, the 
effect is real strong. Let us say when Mars 
reaches in R. A. at full hours such as 2h0m, 
5h0m and a GAP is made within a few days 
thereafter in either direction up or down, 
jump in right away making commitments in 
the direction of the gap, since a big move 
develops here right away. 
   First, I shall bring the dates when Mars in 
R. A. passed the full hours during 1938, the 
year we shall use as example. 
 0 hour R. A. Mars January 30, 1938 
 1 hour R. A. Mars February 21-22, 1938 
 2 hour R. A. Mars March 15-16, 1938 
 3 hour R. A. Mars April 6, 1938 
 4 hour R. A. Mars April 27, 1938 
 5 hour R. A. Mars May 18, 1838 
 6 hour R. A. Mars June 7, 1938 
sacredtraders.conm
 
47 
 7 hour R. A. Mars June 28, 1938 
 8 hour R. A. Mars July 19-20, 1938 
 9 hour R. A.  Mars August 11, 1938 
10 hour R. A. Mars September 4, 1938 
11 hour R. A. Mars September 29, 1938 
12 hour R. A. Mars October 24, 1938 
13 hour R. A. Mars November 29, 1938 
14 hour R. A. Mars December 15, 1938 
 
   Here is the effect that happened when 
these hours were passed on the dates 
given: 
   At 0 hour was a low area; a sharp 2 day 
move developed but was lost again, even an 
extra 50 points, yet we ran into good profits 
by mid-February anyhow. 
   1 hour: we made a gap down between Feb 
23 and 24. 
   2 hours: we dropped sharply further. 
   3 hours: Brought the low and  A GAP UP 2 
days later with a sharp run upwards of 
nearly 200 points. 
   4 hours: we just had passed the top. 
   5 hours: A very tiny top, but we find a gap 
the next day and it was downward, so down 
we went until the end of May. 
   6 hours: a day after the minor peak of 
June 6, 1938. 
   7 hours: we just pass the peaks of April 
and May previous. 
   8 hours: the very top of the movement. 
   9 hours: in the downtrend with a GAP 
DOWN the next day; we went lower. 
  10 hours: range very narrow, nothing 
visible. 
  11 hours: day before we had the low; we 
open with a gap upwards and what a 
sizzling move we began! 
  12 hours: the very peak day. 
  13 hours: in the move, but the day after 
cam A GAP DOWN and lower we went for 
two weeks. 
  14 hours: in the move nothing much visible. 
   Take your time to check over the situation 
and digest this important rule which should 
prove very profitable to your, if you but wait 
for the gaps which I emphasized as the cue 
to direction. The  moves last for quite awhile, 
sometimes one full hour in Mars’ R.A. 
motion. 
 
RULE NO. 10A 
MARS R.A. PLUS DAILY VARIATION OF 
VENUS HELIOCENTRIC EXTREME 
LONGITUDE (1*37’32”) 
 
   The title of this rule sounds rather queer: 
add a piece of Venus on to Mars. It works 
and this is what we look for. Nature’s 
combinations are queer and so it this.  
   We know that the extreme speed of the 
daily variation of Venus is 1*37’32”. This 
value we use with a reservation. We cannot 
very well add degrees to hours, but we can 
add hours to hours, so we shall call the 
value 1h37m32s, and add that. 
   A few examples are only necessary to 
show how the rule is applied. We use 1938 
again and get great surprises! 
Top January 10, 1938 
   When Mars’ R.A. is  23h 4m20s 
                                   +   1h37m32s 
                                  
24h41m52s=0h41m52s 
   Note: 0 hours is the same as 24 hours. 
   This was February 14-15, 1938, the real 
low point. 
Top February 23, 1938 
   Mars R.A. at                +1h37m32s 
                                          2h41m47s 
   This was the Mars R. A. place of March 
31, 1938, the very extreme low day! 
   Good things are not cooked too well, so 
please continue the work to gain experience   
and profits. 
 
RULE NO. 11A 
VENUS R.A. PLUS 4 TIMES THE DAILY 
EXTREME VARIATION OF VENUS 
LONGITUDE (1*37’32”) 
 
   This rule is exactly on the same principle 
as rule No. 10A, with the exception that 
instead of using Mars R.A. we shall use 
Venus Right Ascension. And, instead of 
adding one Unit of the daily heliocentric 
variation in extreme speed of Venus which is 
1*37’32”, we shall use four such Units or 
6*30’8”. 
   Like in rule No. 10A we turn the degrees of 
this value into hours and minutes by just 
changing the name. We then get 6h30m8s. 
   To an extreme top or bottom we begin to 
add this increment and we shall obtain very 
fine results. 
   I shall bring one single example which will 
show the rule and which will show at the 
sacredtraders.conm
 
48 
same time the intimate relationship between 
Venus 
and 
Mars 
when 
the 
proper 
proportions are used. 
   We will use January 10, 1938 the major 
top hides as a starting point. Venus was in 
R.A. that day at       18h56m59s 
       we add to this 
      value our 4 units  6h30m  8s 
                                25h27m  7s or 1h27m7s 
   This brings us to the major low of March 
31, 1938. We arrive at the same place by 
using Mars’ R.A. in rule No. 10A. 
   Finds like these give one satisfaction that 
something was achieved and mind you, I 
know this rule for years, carried it in my 
notes and in my mind without telling anyone 
about it. Such laws are so colossal that I am 
not quite sure whether you are able to size 
up what you have here   You may be able to 
do so in a month or two. 
   This 
concludes 
the 
rules 
for 
Hide 
movements. 
 
 
PART IV 
THE COMMODITY COTTON 
 
RULE NO. 1B 
MERCURY, VENUS AND MARS 
GEOCENTRIC ONE YEAR PRIOR 
 
   For cotton we have to use the geocentric 
passage of Mercury, Venus and Mars over 0 
degrees of a sign to obtain changes in trend; 
however, not the current year’s motion of 
these planets is to be used, but the ones of 
the year before. Thus, you use the 
ephemeris (Raphael) of 1939 to find the 
changes in 1940. 
   The places where these planets turn 
retrograde or direct in the previous year give 
also good results for the year following. 
 
THE COMMODITY LARD 
RULE NO. 1C 
 
   We take the Mercury positions where the 
planet turns retrograde. From this place we 
have to figure backwards (not forward) to 
locate changes of trend. We have to go 
backwards in five steps as follows: 
   Example: We shall use the year 1938 and 
begin with April 11, 1938, on which day 
Mercury turns retrograde at 5*36’ Taurus. 
 
Step No. 1 ( go back 6*55’23” from this 
retrograde place of Mercury this gives us 
March 31, 1938 bottom) 
Step No. 2 (Go back from the same place , 
April 11, 1938 Mercury retrograde place of 
5*36’ Taurus, 41*32’18” this gives us the 
gap downwards on 3/11/38.) 
Step No. 3 (go back from the retrograde 
Mercury place 69*13’50”. This gives us the 
top of February 23, 1938.) 
Step No. 4 (go back from the 4/11/38 which 
is the 5*36’ Taurus place 103*50’46”. This 
gives us the bottom of February 3, 1939.  
And finally, the previous place of Mercury 
direct or January 10, 1938 was the top. 
   Here is another setting using the same 
degrees as above from another retrograde 
place: We use August 13,1938 to start 
backwards; position of Mercury retrograde 
is:  
 
August 13, 1938          12*19’     Virgo 
                                  -    6*55’                               
August 1, 1938              5*24’     Virgo 
                                 -  41*32’18” 
July 7, 1938                  0*47’      Leo 
                                -  69*13’50” 
June 23, 1938               3*  5’     Cancer 
                             -   103*50’46” 
June 7, 1938               28*28’     Taurus 
 
   The units use in this method are from 
certain cycles which I have developed. 
   Similar to the rules which were set down  
in this work you may produce rules for any 
other commodity. 
   However, the old story remains true: stick 
to one single commodity, use and exploit it. 
After a time you get to know it as well as 
yourself. Do not trade in several unless you 
keep plenty of extra cash to take care of the 
losses that are due to result. Reasons for 
this statement are amply enlarged in this 
work. 
   Now you know what planetary motions do 
bring about. I hope you benefited from the 
studies you have made. Mark down the day 
you have acquired (ordered) this work. After 
you have studied it for a few months, try to 
forecast on hand of that date via planetary 
positions 
the 
good 
and 
bad 
periods 
concerning you own trading. Interesting and 
valuable rules can be formulated by keeping 
tab of the days when trades are started and 
closed.

49 
STOCKS 
 
   On hand of the many rules supplied to 
forecast the movements of wheat, hides, 
cotton and lard, I must not overlook to say a 
few words about stocks. 
   It is strange that the public is thoroughly 
stock minded but very little “commodity-
minded”. 
Stocks 
can 
be 
bought 
for 
investments and put away in strong boxes. 
They take little room. Commodities need 
warehouses. Commodities are made for 
sale and not for “keeps”. 
   Our 
rules 
and 
laws 
do 
not 
treat 
investments. We are solely interested in 
swings of short or normal duration, usually 
of not more than six to eight months. 
   Any stock operator or trader who is 
interested 
in 
trading 
for 
the 
periods 
mentioned can take the rules given for Hides 
and use them. This does not mean that he 
should follow Hides literally I know very well 
that hides move 80% to 90% in sympathy 
with 
stocks. 
They 
have 
astronomical 
sympathies to each other. But, it does 
happen that hides follow occasionally for  a 
month or so their own peculiar trend, at 
which time you would be wrong when you 
use the Hide pattern. 
   Therefore let us say: The changes in 
stocks occur on the very same days as 
those of Hides, but we must follow the 
direction each one takes. 
   Use ellipses and charts the same way as 
shown for commodities. Select one active 
stock that sells between 25 and 75 dollars. 
Stick to this one; learn to know this tock well 
and the rule or rules it likes to follow. The 
stock you select should be listed on the 
Exchange for many years. It then has history 
behind which can be put down on chart 
paper. Leave new stocks to the public.
