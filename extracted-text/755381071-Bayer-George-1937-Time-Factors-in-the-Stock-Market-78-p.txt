As
a ~urther

let
us
cons~der
tbe
case
of a ~an
~no
has

a~cicient.
We
will
assume
that
he
crossed
the
st~~et
against
a traf:ic
light
and
was
h~t
~y
an
autcmobile.
1his
ac~iden~
~ould
not

if
he
~ad
not
c~ossed
t~e

while
~ne
l~ght
was
aqe f ne t,
him.
His
own
d ecLa Lo n
to
cross
t~e
street,
contrary
to
accep t ed
t:-affic
laws
I
was
the
cause
of
the
accident.
The
direct
cause
~as
the
car
hitting
him.
!t
~s obvious
~hat
if
he
had
crossed
the
street
against
the
Liqht
and
~ith
no
danger
in
sight,
he
would
have
surely
c=ossed
in
safety.
The
diIect
cause
of
his
accident
was
his
decision
to
take
the
~isk
of
c~ossinq
at
the
~rong
tirn~.
Naturally,
~he
important
~uestion
arises
- ~as
~t
necessary
that
he
should
cross
the
st=eet
t~
meet
with
an accid~nt.
or
could
he
have
avoided
it?
A vecy
good
reason
must
have
caused
him
to
cross
t~~
street
agai~st
the
light,
or
else
he would
have
waited
for
the
ligh~
to
change.
!t
can
he
assum~d
that
his
mind
was
clear
and
normal
and
that
no
attempt
was
made
to
bec~me
involvoed
in
an
acciden.t~
Nevertheless,
the

Counting
these

times
as

in

we
find
them
to

There

a

for

and
not
25 or

But
this

in anothe~

and
must
be
passed
over.
Among the

we
must

all

th~
very

picture

such
ups
and

of such

We

call

th.e ones
we
are
most
interested
in.
These
vibrations
are
the
inner
voice
which
causes
the
buyi~g
and
selling
of stocks.
It may
be
compared
to
fallinq
in
love
wit~
a stock
or,
taking
the
other
ext=eme,
hating
it.
This
inner
force
simply
pushes
a

of
people
into

Mathematics
defines
an
ellipse
as
the
locus
of
a
point
-which
mo~es
in
a path
so
that
the
sum
of its
distances
f~om
twa
fixed
~oints
has
a constant
value.
The
two
fixed
PQints
are
called
fo~i.
It
nas
been
proven
that
the
planets
move
in
space
in
ellipses
around
the
Sun
which
is
located
in
one
of
the
foci.
This
la~
~ives
the

link
and
is the
reason
I tr~ed
to
devise
certain
forms
of

which
could
be

use

T'herefore,

to

to
overcome
this

Here
is
the
r~sult:
Each

reacts
(also

at
sp~cific
de9res
and
minutes
of
the
Zodiac
to
one
or
two
planets
in
one
or- twa
positions.
Taking
~heat
to~ ~~ample,
we
note
that
Venus
and
Mars
and
n-o oth.er
pi anet
brings
about
t~e
ch.anges.
These
two
planets,
as
they
cross

respectively
12'
16'
of a sign,
~roduce
changes.
The
~tock

and
the
changes
occur
wh.en Venus
