CYCLES, PATTERNS AND OSCILLATORS
IN THE STOCK MARKET
by Walter Bressert

The order of the Universe shows itself in the thousands of cycles observable in nature and documented by the
Foundation for the Study of Cycles. It shows in the minute structures of molecules, atoms and sub- atomic particles. It
also shows in the ordered structure of the solar system and, as scientists are now discovering, in the interrelationships
of galaxies. The smallest particles to the largest clusters of galaxies follow some kind of order...so why not the
markets.

Prices move in a manner that may initially appear to be random, but with study, show an underlying order. Cycles,
waves, Gann squares, angles, Fibonacci relationships in both time and price, planetary influences and other
observable phenomena are reflections of this underlying order. Unfortunately, we do not know its causes, nor do we
have a solid grasp of the rules ... but anyone who studies the markets with an open mind will see that there is indeed an
order to all markets, especially in the formation of highs and lows, which are focal points or high energy levels of a
market.

There are some who arbitrarily dismiss cycles and the natural order of the markets on the premise that such concepts
smack of pre-determination and violate man’s God-given free will. But with his free will man can choose to participate
in the markets or not, just as he has the choice to participate, or not, in the cycles of good times and recession through
his investments. By knowing the approximate timing of cycles man can use them to his advantage.

The predictable cycles of the seasons are there for man to use, and planting corn in November because prices are high
would be a waste of time and money. Through observation we know better. Buying stocks or gold at the top of a
market is something we all want to avoid, but unfortunately the fundamentals are almost always the most bullish, and
most tempting, at tops. Without study we are oblivious to the natural order of the markets, which must be actively
sought out and discovered. True, we do not know ail of the rules of the markets, but we do know that we want to buy
bottoms and sell tops. We also know that we can rack up sizable profits by trading with the trend.

Fortunately for us, the energy of the markets is visible in the movement of price, which when charted, shows repeating
patterns of time and price in cycles and Elliott Waves. Market oscillators also reflect this energy as overbought and
oversold levels. More often than not, these overbought and oversold levels are also cycle highs and lows . By
identifying the lengths of the most powerful and consistent cycles, called dominant cycles, we can often anticipate tops
and bottoms as well as the direction of the trend, or longer cycle. Much of this is explained in my book, ‘The Power
of Oscillator/Cycle Combinations".

CCI 30 OSC/CYCLE COMBO FOR
4-YEAR CYCLE BOTTOMS OF S&P INDEX _

The oscillator/cycle combination that confirmed the bottom of every 4-Yeai
cycle has 5 steps that must be met:

1) The price low must be 32 or more months from the previous 4-Year Cycle
bottom.

2) The Detrend must drop below the Buy line at -70 and turn up.

3) The CCI must drop below zero. A drop below the Buy Line at -100, which
occurred at 6 of the 9 bottoms, would be comforting but is not necessary.

4) The CCI must then rise above the Crossover.
5) Following the requirements of 1 through 4 being met, the Trigger entry
of buying the price high of the month that exceeded the high of the Crossover

month confirmed every 4-Year Cycle bottom. It is the safest entry, but not
always the one with the lowest dollar risk.

CCI58 OSC/CYCLE COMBO FOR TRADING CYCLE LOW IN T-BONDS

1) Prices must be in the Trading Cycle Timing Band (15-30 market days from
the previous Tradung Cycle low.

2) The cci58 must have dropped below the Buy Line at -25 and turned up.

3) The Trigger Entry is to place a buy stop above the high of the upturn
day.

4) The protective stop should be placed below the price low of the Trading
Cycle.

DJIA RSI3M3 OSC/CYCLE COMBO FOR PRIMARY CYCLE BOTTOM

1) Prices are declining into the 13 - 20 week trough to trough timing
band (and can extend to up to 25 weeks).

2) The oscillator drops below the Buy Line at 55.
3) The oscillator turns up.

4) Place a Trigger Entry buy stop above the price high of the upturn

week.

Averages, however, are not very helpful in trading a market, so let's look at a market qualifier -- those cycles that
exceeded the high of the previous 4-Year Cycle versus those that did not. As you can see in the Tables 2 and 3 below,
there is a distinct difference between those cycles in Table 2 that exceeded the high of the previous 4-Year Cycle and
those cycles in Table 3 that did not.

Column 3 in both charts shows the % advance from the low of the cycle to the high. The average % advance in Column
3 is grossly distorted by the 372% rise from the 1932 depression low. The average advance with this cycle omitted is
only 52%, less than half the 127% rise for those cycles in Table 2 that exceeded the previous cycle high.

Since the current 4-Year Cycle has already exceeded the high of the previous 4-Year Cycle, we will compare aspects of
the two types of cycles and also establish time and price projections for the cycle high.

Time and Price Expectations for
the Next 4-Year Cycle High

The smallest advance of all years in Table 2 was the 38% rise from the 1978 low. The cycles that began in 1970 and
1978 are separated from the other cycles because they occurred in a broad trading range. Of the cycles that were not
in a trading range, the smallest advance was 73%, which was met or exceeded in all 9 years not in a trading range.

To look at it another way, of the 11 cycles that exceeded the high of the previous cycle, one rose a minimum of 38%,
which would be 3260 if calculated from the October '90 low of 2365. Ten of 11 (90%) of the cycles advanced 67-86%
or more above the cycle low, which equates to a price objective of 3950 to 4375.

Column 5 in both tables shows the number of months from low-to-high. Here again, there is a great difference between
the two types of cycles. Those that exceeded the previous cycle high averaged a rise of 43 months from the cycle
bottom, while those that did not exceed the previous high averaged a rise of only 26 months. Focusing on Column 5 in
Table 2, three cycles rose for 31 to 33 months, and the rest topped 42 to 60 months after the cycle began.

Using these time periods from the October 1990 cycle bottom projects a top of the 4-Year Cycle no earlier than April
1993 (31 months) to June (33 months). A continued rise after June 1993 is likely to be followed by a rise to at least
March 1994 (42 months), and possibly as late as November 1994 (50 months) ... So the initial time period for the top of
the 4-Year cycle is April 1993 through November 1994.

Our Time and Price Window for the top of the current 4-Year Cycle is then April 1993 to November 1994 at 3950 to
4375.

Will the Fundamentals
Support this Projection ?

Based on the current fundamental picture with the focus on the national debt, bank failures, real estate problems, etc.,
this projection may seem unrealistic. But if you visit the library and look at the front page of the Wall Street Journal for
the two years following the cycle bottoms in.'74, '78, '82 and "87, you will find different fundamentals, but similar gloom
and doom predictions being made as the stock market was rising, and you will find almost NO predictions that were
even close to the price and time levels of the actual tops of each cycle.

The fundamentals of supply and demand move the markets, but the focus of the fundamental news is always the most
bullish at tops and the most bearish at bottoms, and it will probably always be that way. Cycle analysis can give you
the confidence to sell tops and buy bottoms with the expectation that the fundamental picture will change to move
prices in the direction of the cycle. :

Based on this analysis there are more than two years before the 4-Year Cycle is due to top. The long-term trend is up,
but a lot can happen between now and then.. We have another way of looking at the market between now and
September '92 based on the historical performance of the stock market relative to the Presidential election.

The Presidential Election and the DJIA
Through September '92

A recession and bearish stock market at the time of a Presidential election can result in a loss to the party in the White
House at the time of the election. Not surprisingly, every effort is usually made to time the stimulation so the economy
and the stock market will be up at the time of the election.

Table 4 shows the % advance in the DJIA from September to September of the election year, which will be September
1991 to September 1992 for the upcoming election. Column 1 is the year in which the 12-month time period ended.
The percentage moves for the advance from the September close to the highest daily close through the following
September are in Column 2. The months in which the highs of the 12-month period were made are in Column 3, and
the number of months from the September close to the highest high of the 12-month period are in Column 4.

a

TABLE 4

Looking at Column 2 you can see that of the 19
years--

-- All 19 years rose a minimum of 2.1%. From the
September '91 close of 3017 a 2.1% rise would to HIGH
be 3080;

-- 90% of the years advanced 3.8%, which would
be 3131;

-- 80% rose 5.2%, which would be 3174;

- 70% advanced a minimum of 7.4%, which
would be 3240. :

These are minimum price objectives that should
be reached on or before September '92.

Looking at Column 3 you can see that --

-- 7 of 19 years, or 37%, made the highs of the
12-month period by January, while

-- 11 of 19 years,.or 58%, made the highs June
through September.

 

Odds are that if new highs are made after
January, the high of the 12-month period is likely
to be made June through September.

Walter Bressert

--- Page 7 ---
Time and Price Patterns

Patterns of time and price can help set expectations for the highs of this 12-month period.

Five years made highs in Oct/Nov, and four of these rose only 2.1 - 5.2 % above the September close ... so if there is
to be an Oct/Nov high it is likely to be made at 3080 to 3174 basis the daily close.

Six of the eight years that made highs December through August rose 7.7 to 12.4%, which would be 3249 to 3391 this
year; and of six years that rose more than 12.4%, ALL rose to 20 - 29%, or 3620 to 3904.

Time and Price Objectives
So, our time and price objectives for the high of this election year time period has three tiers:

1) If the high of the 12-month time period is to be seen in Oct/Nov, a minimum high of 3080 to 3174 should be seen.
if this price range is not met in Oct/Nov or if the DJIA exceeds 3174, then

2) the high would be expected to occur at 3249 to 3391, in the Dec/Aug time period. And if 3391 should be
exceeded, then

3) arise to 3620 to 3904 is likely to be seen in the month of September.

These objectives and the Window for the 4-Year Cycle help determine longer- term expectations, but it is the weekly
Primary cycle that is of interest to most traders and mutual fund switchers.
The Weekly Primary Cycle

All markets have a powerful and consistent weekly cycle that sets the intermediate-term trend. By identifying this cycle
it is possible to:

1) anticipate tops and bottoms, and
2) determine the trend.

An historical review of the DJIA and the S&P Index shows a cycle of approximately 20 weeks as measured from
low-to-low. However, cycles in the market do not move in sine waves, but often extend, contract and sometimes seem
to skip a beat. Markets also act differently in bull and bear markets, leaning to the right in bull markets to produce right
translation, ‘

and leaning to the left in bear markets to produce left translation.

“A

Timing Bands for a Bull Market

By studying the historical performance of bull and bear markets this shifting of highs and lows can be used to our
benefit. The stock market has been in an extended bull market that is likely to continue over the long term. The
following Timing Bands, derived from the bull market, have been 80% accurate in the past and are likely to be as
accurate in the future:

Low to High ... expect the cycle to top 9 to 16 weeks from a cycle bottom.

High to Low ... Once the cycle has topped, expect the cycle to bottom 1 to 9 weeks from that top.

Walter Bressert 5

 

 

--- Page 8 ---
   

Ch.
TAG XIV
1992

Low to Low ... measuring from the low that began the cycle, the next low should normally occur 13 to 20 weeks from
that low. The most probable time for the cycle to bottom is the overlap area of the high-to-low and low-to-low Timing
Band.

These Timing Bands are for bull markets. Remember that these are 80% bands, and about 20% of the time the market
will top or bottom outside of the bands.

Following a top or bottom these Timing Bands will give you a reasonable expectation of when to expect the next high
or tow of the cycle, and oscillators will help you identify the top or bottom as it occurs.
Time and Price Windows

Price can be combined with time to produce a Time and Price Window in much the same manner as the objectives
were established for the 4-Year Cycle high. These Time and Price Windows are shown on the chart below as boxes at
the tops and bottoms of the price bars.

The actual tops and bottoms of the weekly Primary Cycle are identified and illustrated by the cycle glyphs just below
the price bars of the cash S&P Index. The tops and bottoms of the cycles are shown by the dashed lines in the lower
panels with the oscillators.

The middle panel, RS! 33, is a modified Relative Strength Index, and the lower panel, CCI 58, is a modified Commodity
Channel Index. The CCl is a longer-term oscillator that shows the cycle highs and lows more clearly than the sensitive
RSI, which usually turns earlier, and also more frequently.

Buy/Sell Lines
Both oscillators have Buy and Sell Lines which are levels that serve as filters to help identify cycle tops and bottoms.
As a general guideline an oscillator will rise above a Sell Line and turn down at or before a cycle top: and an oscillator
will drop below a Buy Line and turn up at or before a cycle bottom.
A glance at the oscillators will show that there are often two oscillator highs in each 20-Week Cycle, and that it is

usually the second one that occurs at the top of the cycle. This is the result of bull market right translation. In bear
markets left translation would usually result in the cycle topping with the first oscillator high.

Four Steps to Identify
Cycle Tops and Bottoms
We now have three of the four steps to identify the tops and bottoms of the cycle;

1) Prices should be within the Time and Price Window, (or at least within the Timing Bands). This eliminates most of
the early turns in the oscillators.

2) One or both oscillators should have risen above a Sell Line for a cycle top, or dropped below a Buy Line for a
cycle bottom.

3) An oscillator should turn down at the cycle top, or turn up at the bottom.

These three rules alone will help identify cycle tops and bottoms, but the real key is the mechanical Trigger Entry,
which is usually a sell stop below the price low of the downturn week, or a buy stop above the high of the upturn week.

4) Place a sell stop to go short below the price low of the downturn week, or a buy stop to go long above the high of
the upturn week.

Notice how the longer term CCI 58 and the shorter term RSI 33 complement each other in the identification of the cycle
tops and bottoms. At Highs A and B it is the CCI 58 that clearly identifies the tops, and at Lows C and Dit is the RSI 33
that better identifies the cycle bottoms.

These are Oscillator /Cycle Combinations (OSCARs)that can be historically tested. High probability OSCARs can be
cataloged and used to identify cycle tops and bottoms as they occur and to trade the markets.

Similar patterns can be developed and used on daily and intraday data.

This overview should give you an idea of how cycles, patterns and oscillators can be used to determine trend to identify
cycle tops and bottoms as they occur.

THE PROBABILITY OF MAKING A SUCCESSFUL Chart 14
TRADE IS MUCH GREATER LATER IN THE
TIMING BANDS THAN EARLIER

While Timing Bands are ranges within which prices have
topped better than 7 times out of 10 in the past, the proba-
bility of making a successful trade is much greater later in
the Timing Bands than earlier.

Normally, 70% of the cyclic tops and bottoms will occur
within the range of the Timing Band; 20% will occur before
the Band, and 10% will occur after the Band. So, by the time
the last day of the 70% Timing Band has been reached, 90% or

more, or the cycles would have already topped, or bottomed.

TIME CYCLES/OSCILLATORS TO IDENTIFY TOPS & BOTTOMS

Using oscillators within the cycle timing band periods greatly improve the accuracy of
identifying cycle tops and bottoms.

All markets have cycles. However, all too often, they contract, extend, or skip a beat.
Predictability can be greatly improved by using cycle time periods, or timing bands,
measured from historical highs and lows.

For example, over the past 10 years 80% of the bottoms of the dominant weekly cycle in the
S&P Index have occurred in a timing band 13 to 20 weeks from the previous cycle bottom;
80% of the tops have occurred 9 to 16 weeks from the low that began the cycle; and 80% of
the bottoms have occurred | to 9 weeks from the top. These timing bands are illustrated
below:

Q ----------- 2-2-2222 --- 16 weeks low to high
waneneneee 9 weeks high to low

20 weeks low to low

 

Oscillators indicate overbought and oversold levels. Cycle tops and bottoms, by their
nature, are overbought and oversold levels tied to specific time periods.

By combining oscillators and cycles, tops and bottoms of cycles can often be identified
within 1 to 3 bars of a top or bottom.

The next page is a chart page showing the weekly and daily S&P Index, with oscillators
stacked below each chart. The following charts are the same charts as those in the included
Bressert TradePlan on disk except for the addition of cycles in the following charts.

Weekly S&P INDEX

With Centered Moving Average and Centered Detrend

The lows and highs of the 20-Week Cycle are identified by the dots
in both the chart and the Detrend. While the cycle highs and lows that

show up in the Detrend match the price highs and lows of the chart
above it, this is not always the case.

A complete cycle phasing should be done over the longest possible
data time series, normally 20 to 30 years, but this 6.7-year period,
which has a smaller sample base, will serve to illustrate both a basic
approach to cycle analysis and important characteristics of cycles.
During this time period there were 16 cycles. The time periods from
low-to-low are listed below from the longest to shortest time periods.

13 15 16 17 18 18 21 21 -M- 22 22 24 26 28 29 30 33

The median length, marked M, is between 21 and 22 weeks, or 21.5
weeks for this time period. Since 1950 the median length has been 22
weeks. Seventy-five percent of the lows occurred 15 to 26 weeks from
the previous low, which is a 75% Timing Band that is very close to the

. 15-25 week Timing Band from the 1950 time series.

Current-time Detrends have another characteristic that turns
detrending into an important oscillator by itself. The Detrend highs
and lows tend to move to "Levels" above and below the moving average
that are often indicators that a cycle high or low is forming, or
about to form.

CYCLEWATCH RESEARCH REPORT

BEAR KISS IN THE DAILY S&P FUTURES

The futures data we use is a “rollover”, with past history adjusted for the spread between the old and the new
contract on the last day of the month preceding delivery. This makes the oscillators more consistent, but
somewhat distorts prices prior to the current contract.

This OSCAR usually occurs in the later stages of a downmove into a cycle bottom of the Trading Cycle or Alpha
Cycle, and can be used as a signal to go short, as an indicator of a bottom and a buy signal, or both.

The OSCAR is formed as follows:

1) The daily 3-10 Oscillator in the S&P futures rises from below the Crossover for two or more days and turns
down while still below the Crossover. This downturn is the Setup. Only the first downturn can generate an
OSCAR, and the 3-10 must rise above the Crossover and drop back below it to set up another OSCAR.

3-10 _ tebe el 3-10 4 Leet

CROSSOVER +. . CROSSOVER

 

2) The Trigger entry occurs with a drop in the S&P below the downturn day, which usually occurs within two
days of the downturn day.

In the DAILY S&P FUTURES CHART below, the a.rows show the downturn day for the 3-10 Oscillator in the
lower panel, and the cyr > low that follows is indicated-- AC=Alpha Cycle low; TC=Trading Cycle low;
PC = 22-Week Primary Cycie low; 1/2PC = 10-Week 1/2 Primary Cycle low. The arrows is the lower panel point
to the 3-10 Oscillator high and downturn that set-up the OSCAR. Notice how 3 OSCARs occur in 4 months in
the bear market into the Sept/Oct 1990 low, and only 2 OSCARs occur in the bull market.

COLUMN 1 is the date of the day that turned the 3-10 Oscillator down, or the downturn day.
COLUMN 2 is the low of the downturn day in the S&P.

COLUMN 4 shows the % decline from entry (the low of the downturn day) to the cycle low. The declines were
from .9% to 6.2%.

COLUMN 5 is the number of days from the downturn day to the cycle bottom. The bottom occurred from 2 to
8 market days following the downturn day for 7 of the 8 OSCARs, with one extending to 13 days. So expect a
decline to last for 2 to 8 days.

COLUMN 6 shows the type of cycle bottom, which was always a Trading Cycle low or an Alpha Cycle low.
Three were also bottoms of the 22-Week Primary Cycle and one was the bottom of the 10-Week 1/2 Primary
Cycle.

Expect a Trading Cycle or Alpha Cycle bottom to occur 2 to 8 days after the Trigger Entry at a decline of .9 to
6.2% from the Trigger Entry price. .

A cycle bottom will often occur as the 3-10 turns up, although there can be one or two oscillator upturns before
the cycle low.

| recommend that you research the samples in the tables and become familiar with them before you trade
them. The table does not show the OSCARs that set-up but did not trigger an entry. The number of samples in
this OSCAR is small, and you should build up the sample size.

Variations of this OSCAR occur in other markets, and in other oscillators. With a little research you can develop
your own OSCARs.

OSCILLATORS

 

Chart 48 |

Weekly DJIA Index (DJIA-W) ... The 22-Week
Prirnary Cycle bottoms are indicated by the
arrows. The oscillator is the modified RS! in the
"The Power of Oscillator /Cycle Combinations”.
It is an excellent short-term oscillator that often
turns as the market turns. The timing is right for
the PC to bottom, and an upturn of this
oscillator to form a price/oscillator divergence
would be a powerful indicator of the PC
bottom.

Dail P_Index (SPC-D) ... Trading Cycle
lows are indicated by the arrows; Alpha Cycle
lows by A ... The daily S&P Index has a 3-10
oscillator plotted be@w’ it with a 16-day
crossover. This is an excellent short-term
oscillator that tends to turn as prices turn.

The oscillator completed a sell pattern at X as
the oscillator turned down below the crossover
on 8/19. Based on similar patterns, odds are
80% that the TC will bottom no later than 9/1
above 406 ... A similar pattern occurred at Y as
the last Trading Cycle and the 1/2 PC
bottomed, and at Z ... Arise above 415.80, the
high of the upturn week, after mid-morning
Monday, will be confirmation that the TC and
PC have bottomed. .
