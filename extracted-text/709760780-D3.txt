Gann’s Master Mathematical Formula For Market Predictions
Master Mathematical Price Time and Trend Calculator
In 1954, at the age of nearly 76, W.D. Gann released a course based upon
mathematical rules for making market predictions. In the advertisement for this method
the author of the add writes: “We will not sell the course of instructions or teach the
mathematical formula for market predictions just to get money, which we do not need or
have to have; we will only sell the courses to people who meet our requirements, and if
we feel after a thorough investigation that a man or woman cannot make a success
investing or trading we will refuse to teach them the courses”.  “The Master Calculator
can only be used with the Master Courses. It is not sold separate from the other courses”.
The price shown for Gann’s Master Course in this ad is $5,000.00, it does not list the
additional cost of the Master Mathematical Calculator. The ad describes the calculator as
a plastic overlay that accurately measures Time, Price and Trend. Many Gann experts and
students have tried to use these overlays, which require the chart to be hand drawn to a
proper scale on graph paper that has 8 squares to one inch. This creates a lot of extra
tedious work. This has caused one of Gann’s greatest discoveries to have been
overlooked for many years. I know that some software programs have the ability to make
these overlays on price charts but that is still not going to help most people because it
turns out that there are also very precise mathematical rules regarding the horizontal axis
or Time! In fact, these same mathematical rules apply to price as well but we will leave
this topic for latter. The advertisement itself contains clues about the calculator, such as
“W.D. Gann’s Record for 52 years”, “After fifty-two years of experience and research

going back hundreds of years, I have proved to my entire satisfaction that history repeats
and that when we know the past, we can determine the future of prices”. The calculator
that Gann is talking about in this ad is his square of 52 overlay, which is based upon the
52 weeks in a year. The basic overlay looks like that show above.
This is also the same geometric form that Gann used for the Square of 90 and
Square of 144 plastic overlays. This basic structure or overlay appears in many books on
Sacred Geometry and is also the secret to George Bayer’s “Trend Determination” course.
Getting back to Gann and the square of 52 course we find that this is the course where
Gann made the confusing statement: “ Within the circle forms the square, there is an
inner circle and an inner square, as well as an outer square and an outer circle which
prove the Fourth Dimension in working out price movements”. This quote is describing a
