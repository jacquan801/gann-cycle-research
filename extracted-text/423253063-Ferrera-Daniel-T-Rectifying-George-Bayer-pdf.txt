Rectifying George Bayer 
 
 
On page 119 of Turning Four Hundred Years of Astrology to practical Use 
and Other Matters by George Bayer, he states that the “Market Light” went out for 
three months from July 31st to December 12th of the year 1914. This was the year that the 
stock markets closed because of World War I. George Bayer claimed that the cause of 
this Lights Out phenomenon was due to the “Eclipse of the Sun” that took place on 
September 15th of 1792 the same year that the New York Stock Exchange came into 
existence. Basically, George Bayer was trying to show the reader that the market closing 
event in 1914 was 122 years from 1792 and that the eclipse of the sun took place 122 
days from the birth date of the New York Stock Exchange. The Bible says to use a day 
for a year. This means that each 360° revolution of the Earth on its axis is to be used as 
one year for the progression of a horoscope. Now this is where the rectification comes in 
and may be the reason George Bayer described this event. If you look at his natal 
horoscope for the NYSE, you find that he has different beginning times for each of the 
planets and he spends the next few pages explaining his reasons for having it this way. I 
am not going to deal with all the planets because this is only intended to be a short article 
on what I think Mr. Bayer wanted the reader to figure out on their own. In his horoscope, 
he has the Sun ☼ at 26°30’F on 5/16/1792 at 2:19 PM. He has the moonÂat 20°40’ 
E on 5/17/1792 at 11:59 AM.  
Now if you do the work and the progressions of the ☼ and Âyou will find that 
his horoscope is off. The eclipse of the Sun he is referring to was exact on September 
16th, 1792 at 4:13 AM at the degree of 24°08’J. If you calculate the Speed of the Sun 
and moon for the one-day period from September 15th to September 16, 1792, you find 
that the Sun moved 58’ 39” and the moon moved 12°40”. Divide both by 365 (days in a 
year) and you find that the progressed Sun moves at the rate of 9.536 seconds of arc per 
day and the progressed moon moves 1.974 minutes of arc per day. If you use the natal 
positions of the Sun & moon that Bayer gives, you will find that the progressed moon 
would have hit the eclipse on December of 1913 and the progressed Sun would have hit it 
in December of 1914. This does not match with what he is saying! He said that the 
“Market Lights” went out on July 31st, 1914 because of the eclipse. If this statement is 
true, then the Horoscope must be rectified. If you do the work, you should 1st come up 
with a natal date of May 16th, 1792 at 11:27 PM. This single time works much better for 
both the progressed sun and moon. For example, the Sun’s position on September 15th, 
1792 at 11:27 PM is 23°56’20”J it will hit the exact eclipse location in 11’40” (11 
minutes 40 seconds) converting the whole number to seconds of arc, we get 666.66 
seconds. Now we just divide this by the speed of the progressed Sun, which is 9.536 
seconds per day. This gives 69.91 or 70 days. Now just add 70 days to 5/16/1792 
(rectified birth) and you get July 25th, for the year 1914.The year 1914 came from taking 
the difference in days between September 15th, 1792 and May 16th, 1792, which is 122 
days. 122 days added as years to 1792 gives the year 1914.  
 
The moon’s position on September 15th, 1792 at 11:27 PM is 21°36’35”J, which 
is 2°31’25” from the exact eclipse longitude. If you convert this all to minutes you get 
120.5235 minutes. Now divide this by the speed of the progressed moon, which is 1.974 
minutes per day and you get 61 days, which would be July 17th, 1914. The actual event 
took place on July 31st, 1914 so this means that the moon progression missed by 14 days 
and the Sun progression missed by 6 days. If you multiply the 14 days by the moon’s 
progressed rate of 1.9744 minutes/day, you get 27.6419 minutes of arc or if you prefer 
27’38”. Doing the same procedure for the Sun, we get 6 x 9.536 seconds/day = 57.216 
seconds of arc or simply 57”. Both these calculations need to be subtracted from their 
respective longitudes on 9/15/1792 at 11:27 PM to determine the correct birth moment. 
 
Subtracting 27’38” from the moon’s position of 21°36’35”J gives 21°08’57”J. 
This would have occurred at 10:35 PM on September 15th, 1792. This means that the 
rectified birth of the NYSE must be Wednesday, May 16th, 1792 at 10:35 PM.  There are 
important secrets to be learned here. One lesson is that aspects that have occurred after 
the birth of the native have their effects take place in proportion to a day for a year.  
 
 
 
If the eclipse made the lights go out, what made them come back on? 
 
According to a computer program, the eclipse started at 6:10 and ended at 12:08 this 
would be 5hrs 58m. Converting to decimals is 5.96, which equals181days if each hour of 
eclipse duration is equal to one month. If you add this to July 31st, you would expect the 
"Market Lights" to be out until January 28th. The computer program shows the central 
time for the eclipse as starting at 7:14 and ending at 11:04. This gives 3hr50m or 3.833 or 
117 days. If you add this to July 31st, you get November 25th. If you take the average of 
these two times (5.96 + 3.833)/2 = 4.8965 or 149 days = December 27th.  The "Market 
Lights" were out for 4 months 10 days or simply 134 days. Bayer says the Market Lights 
were out for 3 months. The November projection makes the most sense in this regard. If 
you divide the 3hr50m by the progressed rate of the moon (1.974min/day) you also get 
116.5 days or November 25th. If you divide the 5hr58m by the progressed rate of the 
moon (1.974min/day) you get 181 again. This is a nice confirmation from the standpoint 
that it now seems to mathematically make sense to add the duration of the eclipse as 
months since the progressed moon speed yields the same general result. 134 days divided 
by the progressed moon yields an eclipse duration of 4.408 or 4hr24min. The actual 
speed of the real moon (not progressed) was about 31'40" of arc per 60-seconds of clock 
time on September 16th 1792. If the eclipse is exact at 24°08' J, then after 4hr24min, the 
moon would be 2°19’34” further or 26°27’34” J. This location is 120° or trine Ì to the 
Natal Sun if you use the above rectified date of 5/16/1792 10:35 PM. This symbolically 
makes logical sense. So it looks like the lights went out when the progressed moon hit the 
eclipse and they came back on when the progressed moon Â was trine Ì to the natal 
sun ☼. You might find it interesting to note that there was a lunar eclipse on September 
30th, 1792, which is 137 days from May 16th, 1792. If you add 137 days as years, you get 
1929 and we all know what happened to the stock market in that year. This article was 
just for fun. I hope that you enjoy it because it’s probably my last. 
 
Sincerely,
