AUTHOR
The author of the series "The PATTERNS of Gann" is Granville
Cooley, a journalist who has studied the market material of the
legendary W. D. Gann since 1983.

                                                                  1
PREFACE
Those of you who read my article in the "Gann and Elliott Wave
Magazine" several years ago know that I do not claim to be a
mathematician. My background is journalism. Like most of you I had
some algebra and geometry in high school and some algebra in college.
I went into journalism and the theorems and equations slipped from my
mind.

Being reared in a Mom and Pop grocery store since I was 10, I
was always pretty good with figures (I finished the bookkeeping
course in high school three months before the rest of the class) but
when I started studying Gann I realized how much I had forgotten.

One market writer did some interesting work on the markets, but
the book was so full of algebra that it was hard to follow. A big
trader, well known in the markets, said he too found the book hard to
follow.

Magazine articles dealing with systems seem to be written only
for advanced mathematicians or for computer programmers.

I will assume that most of you are like me. Some mathematical
background, but not a great deal.

This series of books, "The PATTERNS of Gann," is dedicated to
you.

When I started studying Gann several years ago it was with
calculator in hand and I suggest that you do the same thing. Some
believe Gann can be solved without looking at the numbers, but I'm
sure that by this time you have learned differently.

The answer has to be in his numbers!

So, with calculator in hand for several years I ran thousands of
numbers through it. Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing the
Gann numbers.

As I did so, PATTERNS emerged.

PATTERNS!

They made no sense at first. I had no background for them.

During my reading of the Gann material I could see that his keys
were based on math (specifically that of the ancient systems),
astronomy, astrology, Masonic and Biblical material and related
writings.

So, I started reading the ancient math, etc. As I did the
PATTERNS began to come into focus.

That will be our watchword as you read this series of books. PATTERNS!
                                                                         2
I will make reference many times to PATTERNS and you too will
learn to recognize them and how to uncover more.

You will also see something else as the PATTERNS emerge. Even
though Gann said he used algebra and geometry simple observational
arithmetic can be used to solve most Gann problems. No algebra is
needed!


This series of books, "The PATTERNS of Gann" were originally to
be titled "Exploring the Numbers of Gann," but I thought a better
title was "The PATTERNS of Gann" since the exploration of the numbers
of Gann is really an exploration for PATTERNS.

Early on in the writing of this series of books I could see that
I was really writing about PATTERNS.

After all, isn't that what market analysis, especially technical
analysis is all about, a search for PATTERNS?

When Elliott looked at a chart of prices and saw the waves, he
was looking for PATTERNS. Followers of Elliott today are still
looking for those same PATTERNS.

When a fundamentalist looks at supply and demand figures he is
looking for PATTERNS which make prices go up and down.

When financial astrologers look at planet configurations which
caused price movement in the past they are looking for PATTERNS.

When market followers look at moving averages they are looking
for PATTERNS.

When they look at divergences in the relative strength index or
the stochastics they are looking for PATTERNS.

When volume followers look at volume or the rise and fall of the
number of contracts outstanding they are looking for PATTERNS.

When the black box makers put together a series of highs, lows
and closes, they are looking for PATTERNS.

When the fundamentalists study the various air currents for
signs of drought they are looking for PATTERNS.

When the cyclists look at the cycles, whether they be
astronomical or Fourier, they are looking for PATTERNS.

When the neuralogist (no not a nerve doctor but a person who
studies computer neurals) seeks the right neurals they are looking
for PATTERNS.

I don't know about the butcher or the baker, but when the
candlestick makers study candlesticks they are looking for PATTERNS.

                                                                        3
Again I say. The study of Gann must be a search for PATTERNS!




Introduction to the Series
I once heard someone say that they were looking for something
with which to pull the trigger in the commodities market. I'm sure a
lot of traders are looking for that something with which to pull the
trigger.

But since over 90 per cent of the traders lose in the commodity
markets, those who pull the trigger either shoot themselves in the
foot or in the head. One is very painful and the other is very
deadly.

This set of books in not about pulling the trigger. It is not a
system on how to make a million dollars in the market in the morning.
It is about certain mathematical and astronomical relationships
between numbers and their possible application to the numbers of W.
D. Gann.

I say possible because I do not claim to be a market guru.

I know there are those who want to study Gann without studying
the numbers, but since the answers to the Gann approach must be in
the numerical systems and since all markets are made up of advances
and declines of numbers, I can't see how it is possible to study Gann
without studying his numbers. For that matter, without studying
numbers in general.

It is said of Gann that he was a Christian and a Mason and it is
known of his use of astrology and geometry. It is believed that his
number system came from those sources.

This series of books, "The PATTERNS of Gann," is an exploration
of the above sources (plus a few others). We will see how they apply
to the Gann material.

I'm not a mathematician. My field is journalism. So you will not
find any x+y=z in this material. I'm sure that the average person
will appreciate that approach as most persons are not mathematicians
either.

BOOK I
The Cycle of Mars

Chapter 1- The Square of 144 Is Laid Out
Like many of you, when I came to that section in chapter 9 of
Gann's commodity course that called for the laying out of the Square
of 144 on the soybean chart of that 267-week period from Jan. 15,
1948 to March, 1953, I put the charts on the floor, got down on my
hands and knees and checked the places where he said to put the
"square."

Needless to say I spent many days and nights down on my hands
and knees, at the end of which I said probably what you said. "So
what."

I talked to a friend of mine who had started his Gann research
months before I started and who had owned the material before turning
it over to me to see what I could make of it.

His background was farming. Mine was newspaper work. He thought
my curiosity as a newspaper man might lead me down some paths he had
never gone.

I asked him if he had ever laid out the Square of 144 on this
particular chart and what were his conclusions. He had laid it out.
His conclusion was the same as mine. "So what?"

We decided to lay it out together and see if either one of us
could discover something the other had missed. We put the square on
this top and that top and this bottom and that bottom and put it on
the "inner square." The results seemed the same. "So what."

I did notice one interesting number.   "68"

It was arrived at by subtracting 144 from another number and
then going up the page by 68. I knew that the low on futures had been
67 but there were two or three times in the late 1930's that the low
had been at 68.

I also remembered that Gann had said in his discussion of the
hexagon (page 113 in the "old" commodity course; section 10, The
Hexagon Chart, page 5 in the "new") that we have "angles of 66
degrees, 67 degrees, 67 1/2 degrees and 68 degrees."
The 67 1/2 degree angle was easy enough to figure out since it
was one of his divisions of the circle. But the other two were
mysteries as far as I was concerned.

                                                                        5
So I put up the chart for awhile. But after going through the
"private papers" and seeing how Gann had marked the paths of Jupiter
and Mars on his 1948 bean chart, I decided to mark all the planets on
my chart to see if I could discover anything.

I did!



Chapter 2- The Lines Are Laid Out

About this time I happened to be flipping through a copy of an
astrology magazine which showed the position of the planets and their
relation to each other by a few lines drawn across a square, which
represented that particular month, instead of on a circular zodiac.

(I'm not an astrologer and didn't know such a representation
could be made. Since that day and a long time after I had laid out my
own chart I found that others had done some similar work.

If I laid out the lines geocentric style (the planets as seen
from the earth) the lines would have to dip down at times because of
the retrograde action of the planets. Retrograde means that a
particular planet seems to move backward in the degrees of the zodiac
circle such as when the faster moving earth goes by a slower planet
like Jupiter.

When the planet seems to move back its position becomes less in
degrees in the circle, like moving from 225 degrees back to 2l9
degrees. If I was representing that movement on a piece of graph
paper like Gann's and had the paper numbered from the bottom to the
top, 0 to 360 degrees, then I would have to dip my line from 225 down
to 2l9 to show the change.

So I decided to lay out the lines heliocentric style. The
heliocentric position of a planet is its position that would be seen
if you were standing where the sun stands. The planets would go in a
circle around you and there would be no retrograde movement.

The lines that are drawn on the chart would be straight lines
and would have no dips. The positions of the planets for any
particular date can be found in a heliocentric ephemeris.

Using the same style chart paper used by Gann I let one-eighth
of an inch equal one cent in price. I also let the one-eighth of an
inch equal one degree in the zodiac. Or one degree equaled one cent.
Going up the page I went from 0 degrees in Aires, marking each 30
degrees for each sign. Using two sheets of paper, since one was not
big enough, I continued on up to the high on soybeans at that time,
$4.36 per bushel.

In the zodiac that was 76 cents beyond 360 degrees or 76 cents
in the second cycle of the zodiac or at l6 degrees in the sign of

                                                                        6
Gemini.

Right under the price of $4.36 on Jan. 15, 1948 I placed a dot
for the position of each of the outer planets on that date. Since
this is a weekly chart the faster moving planets Mercury and Venus
would show up pretty much as straight up and down lines and since my
interest was mainly in the planet Mars, I didn't put in the faster
moving planets.



Chapter 3-An Immediate Discovery

As stated in chapter 2, I had placed dots to represent the
planets' positions on Jan. l5, l948. Instead of listing them in their
signs I listed them at their absolute degree in the 360 degree
circle:

Mercury--318
Venus--12
Earth--113
Mars--133
Jupiter--251
Saturn--138
Uranus--84
Neptune--191
Pluto--133

In his discussion of the Square of 144 chart Gann never
mentioned the planets. In fact he never mentioned the planets in any
of the work in the course although there are many hints at their use.
It was in his "private papers" that evidence of his use of the
planets was found.

However, his use of astrology was public information as far
back as the 1920's as shown in his book, "The Tale of the Tape." But
he never mentioned it in the course which is now available to the
public.

When I extended the line of Mars out it connected with Jupiter
at 276, which was also the price of soybeans at that time, $2.76 in
the week of 11-26-1948, which shows on his famous "private paper"
soybean chart. I extended the line further and found an immediate
discovery that I probably would not have known if I had not put on
the lines.

Mars crossed Jupiter again in this time period in the week of
Feb. 6, 195l. This crossing at 344 degrees was also at the price of
soybeans, $3.44, although the price came a short time later.




                                                                        7
Chapter 4-Looking at the High

Although both of these crossings of Jupiter by Mars occurred at
the exact price of beans, neither one of these crossings was at the
real high of this time period. Remember we started this 267-week
study as presented in Gann's discussion of the Square of 144 on Jan.
15, 1948 when the high was $4.36.

Did you look at the planetary positions on Jan. 15, 1948 that I
listed in chapter 3 and find something interesting?

If you did not, try comparing the number of Mars with the other
planets. Now what did you find? Correct. You found Mars and Pluto at
conjunction (at the same degree) at:

133

That's an interesting number because of its relationship to a
number in "The Tunnel Thru the Air," Gann's novel, and its
relationship to the Great Cycle. But that's another work for another
time and there is no need to go down that path now.

It is also interesting because of its position on the Square of
Nine chart in relationship to a triangle of the Teleois and their
relationship to a paragraph in Gann's planetary discussion of
resistance lines on soybeans in his "private papers."

But that again is for another work and that path would take us
down lots of roads with many forks and the work we have at hand is
enough to fill this book.



Chapter 5-Subtracting 360 Degrees

Just like in a single digit numbering system (another path we
will explore later) where "you cannot go beyond 9 without starting
over" Gann noted that you cannot go more than 360 degrees in a circle
without starting over.

(We will discover why later in our study of "Natural Squares.")
He illustrates this in his discussion of the price and time chart of
0 to 360 degrees on page 153 of the course.

Actually the high on beans was $4.36 3/4, but Gann often rounded
off numbers for convenience sake. So, subtracting 360 from 436 I got
76. As I said in the preface, I ran thousands of numbers through my
calculator looking for PATTERNS. Here, I went one better than Gann.
Instead of subtracting 360 from 436, I subtracted 76 from 436 and got
360 and kept subtracting 76 until I could not subtract any more in
this manner:

436-76=360
360-76=284
                                                                        8
284-76=208
208-76=l32
132-76=56

That 56 was very interesting. Why? From the top at 436 on Jan.
l5, l948 to the low of 20l on Feb. 14, 1949 was:

56 weeks!

Gann never pointed out this time frame in his discussion of the
Square of l44. I would not have known it if I had not laid out the
chart. It was confirmed by my layout of the weeks on the 38 columns
as suggested in chapter 7 of the course.

Both the numbers 56 and 76 as well as the number 133 are
connected with the "Great Cycle." And since Gann seemed to give a
clue when he said his 2x1 line coming down would cross at 303 (436-
133) and the fact that his 267-weeks was just one more than 2x133, I
concentrated a long time on 133.

As I noted earlier, it's position on the Square of Nine chart
and its relation to the Teleois angle and for the reasons given
above, it was difficult not to concentrate on it.

But that concentration, interesting as it was, led nowhere at
that time so I rolled up the chart and it was untouched for several
years.

Because of sickness in the family (I'm now the sole caregiver
for two elderly parents), I had pretty much put aside my Gann studies
for several years, only going through it occasionally.

One night in early 1989 I called my farmer friend and told him
not to be long on beans. I had not seen a chart of beans for many
years and the only thing I knew about current prices was picked up
from the commodity news on TV.

They were somewhere in the middle $8 range. He asked me why he
should not be long. I told him Mars and Jupiter would be in
conjunction the next day. I told him he needed to buy some puts.
Beans would probably be down the next six to eight weeks.
They never went up from that date. Five days later they dropped
limit down and went on down 90 cents during the next six to eight
weeks and started recovering.

I called my friend a few weeks later and asked him if he had
bought the puts. He said no. He thought I was crazy. He had looked up
the date in his ephemeris and the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter
didn't come up until March. I told him he was looking in the wrong
book. The date I had given him was the helio date and he had been
looking in his geo book.

A short time later I was visiting a small commodity office where
my friend and a few others were present. They were talking about what
a good call I had made. One asked me to tell him when I had something
                                                                        9
coming up. I called him that night and told him not to be long (the
market on the charts looked strong at that point and he and the
others at the commodity office thought the direction was up).

I told him the geo Mars and Jupiter conjunction was coming up
the next day.

That call was off...by five days. The market moved up another
five cents during those five days and then headed down. Not only did
it go down for six or eight weeks like a I predicted for another 90
cents, but kept on going down from there for several months. I didn't
know where it bottomed as I was still not looking at charts.

I do not relate this to brag about a couple of good calls, but
to show that Gann's Mars and Jupiter conjunction still seems to
depress the bean market. I checked this out on a weekly chart several
years ago for a 10-year period and it was working then.

And it still seems to be working now.

It did not always catch the exact top but from the point where
the conjunction was made the market moved down or sideways for at
least six to eight weeks if not for longer.

As I told my friend, "you might not want to be short, but you'd
better not be long." By the way, the man did not take my advise on
the geo because, as I said earlier, the market on the charts looked
strong and friendly. Needless to say, he lost. You can confirm those
two calls by looking them up on your charts.

The recent (1991) conjunctions with the same results renewed my
interest in the 267-week chart under question. And although we will
return to the Mars-Jupiter conjunction later in this book, let's look
again at the Mars-Pluto conjunction of January, 1948. With some
tinkering and running numbers back and forth through the calculator I
came up with a most interesting set of numbers.


Chapter 6-133 or 132?

The cycle of Mars is 687 days in its 360 degree circle around
the sun. So it goes approximately .524 degrees a day. So two days
before its conjunction with Pluto, Mars would be at 132 degrees.
Since this is a weekly chart maybe the operative number is 132 and
not 133. If so, it sets up a whole list of interesting number
combinations.

Remember how we subtracted 76 from 436 several times and got 56
as the final answer? If we add 76 and 56 we get:

132

If we place the Square of 144 on 132 what do we get?

276 (132+144)
                                                                        10
That's where Mars later crossed Jupiter (ala Gann) and was one
of the highs on beans!

As noted earlier, during this 267-week period there were two
crossings of Mars and Jupiter, one at 276 and one at 344. After
passing Jupiter at 276 degrees Mars finished its 360 degree circle,
then went on to catch the slower moving Jupiter, this time at 344
degrees.

When we subtract the conjunction of 276 from the conjunction of
344 what do we get?

68

So Mars has to go 68 degrees farther in its own orbit to catch
Jupiter each time around. Is this the "angle of 68 degrees" Gann
mentioned?

On page 152 of the course Gann mentions time being 68 weeks in
the second square and in the paragraph below that he mentions the
price of 300 being at 68 on the scale.

If we add 76 to 68. what do we get?

144!

If we subtract 56 from 144, what do we get?

88

And 88 is 2x44 which was the cash low on beans in 1932, as
anyone who has read the course well knows. And for those who like the
number 33, 132 is 4x33.

So, from Mars position at 132 and the number of degrees Mars
goes to catch Jupiter after making its cycle, and the subtraction of
360 degrees from 436, and the subtraction of several 76's from the
circle to get 56, we come up with a series of numbers which have a
relationship to each other and to l44.

We can put down the numbers in this manner:

56, 68, 76, 88

The sum of the end numbers is 144 and the sum of the middle
numbers is 144 and the midpoint for each set is 72. Is this what Gann
meant when he talked about the "inner square?"

There is an interesting relationship between these numbers as
far as squares are concerned and that probably should be left to a
discussion on squares, but I will point it out in passing.

If we multiply 56 times 88 and add the square of half of the
difference in the numbers we will get the square of the midpoint:
                                                                        11
56x88=4928
Add 256 (square of half of 32, 16x16)
Total is 5184 or 72x72

I will let you do the other one to get the idea.



Chapter 7-Combinations of Numbers Compared to Prices

We have seen how subtracting a series of 76's from 436 ended up
with 56. Now let's subtract a series of 56's from 436 in the same
manner.

436-56=380
380-56=324
324-56=268
268-56=212
212-56=156
156-56=100
100-56=44, the cash low on beans!

(Did you think to count the number of 56's. Try it!)

Look at the course again. Gann says the week ending March 7,
195l (actually 1953) is 2l2 weeks from Feb. 14, l949. Since the time
from January, 1948 to Feb. 14, 1949 (as was determined by the 38
columns in his chapter 7) was 56 weeks, then this section is 268
weeks long (212+56) and not 267. (I noted earlier the possibility of
a 266-week section).

Note the figures above and we see that 436 minus 3x56 leaves 268
and 56 from 268 is 212. Since he put on the Square of 144 at this
point we see that:


56+144+68=268
Also 144+68=212

In his discussion of the 15-day, 24-hour chart Gann notes that
it is about 144 from 201 1/2 to 344, so he seems to do a little
hedging here. If we make 201 1/2 into 200 we get other interesting
combinations.

56+44=100
56+44+44=144
56+44+44+56=200
56+44+44+56+68=268
56+56=112
44+68=112
112+56+44=212
56+144+144=344
132+56+44=232, the low on Oct. l6, l950
144-56=88, one of the times periods Gann mentions in this
                                                                       12
section and of course 2x44.
56+76+68=200
56+56+44+44+68=268

Also, 200+110 (a number mentioned several times in "The Tunnel
Thru the Air" and also mentioned in the 15-degree, 24-hour chart)
equals 3l0 the high on Dec. l5, 195l.

We have seen that 144 plus 68 is 212 or the time from the
February, 1949 low to the end of the time period under question.

There is an interesting relationship among the number 212, the
square of the range from 44 to 436, and the 2xl angle coming down
from 436. Gann notes that this section is 267 weeks long and the 2xl
angle (one-half of 267 or 133) makes the angle come out at 436 minus
133 or 303.

Subtracting 44 from 436 we find that the range is 392. By
subtracting l80 from 392 we get 212.

Gann squared the range in a certain way and writers have zeroed
in on that method. There is no need to explain that method here as
most readers of Gann are familiar with it.

From his writings Gann seemed to suggest another way of squaring
the range and I will use it here even though it is best left to a
discussion on the squares. (Which will be done in a later book.)

If we square 392 in the usual way of squaring a number (and not
that certain way mentioned above) we find that 392x392=153,664. We
will then proceed to subtract circles of 360 degrees Gann-style.
There are lots of short cuts for doing that and I have already done
the work for you. By subtracting 426 circles of 360 degrees we end up
with the number 304.

If we square 212 we get 212x212=44,944. Subtracting 124 circles
of 360 we are left with 304 again. 304 is just one above Gann's
number of 303.



Chapter 8-A Coincidence of Numbers

Is the fact that the numbers 56, 68, 76 and 88 seem to play an
important part in the other numbers in this 267-week period under
study just a coincidence?

A writer once looking over all the claims made by various
investigators of the numbers in the Great Pyramid noted that numbers
could be manipulated to prove the various theories of the origin of
the Great Pyramid and its meaning.

He's probably right. But when so many numbers seem to go
together in a PATTERN, is it coincidence? Was our starting point at
132 just a coincidence?
                                                                        13
Let's look at Gann's last comment in discussing the weekly
section under the Square of 144.

He says to place the calculator on 310 and the price line is on:

132!

Just for fun let's check the position of the planets in the
helio circle for Dec. 28, 1932, the date of the 44 low on cash beans.

Mercury-l92
Venus-208
Earth-96
Jupiter-162
Saturn-306
Uranus-22
Neptune-158
Pluto-112

Oh, yes. Mars was at 12 degrees in the sign of Leo or at:

132!



Chapter 9-Mars and Jupiter
Since Gann seemed to zero in on the Mars and Jupiter
conjunctions as evidenced in his 1948 chart of soybeans I will devote
the rest of this discussion on the conjunctions of those two planets
since the beginning of this century to see if we can come up with
interesting or enlightening observations.

(I am sure by now that you are quite tired of me using the term
"interesting" but I know of no other way of expressing the findings
in the Gann material.)

To begin, I will list all the geocentric conjunctions since Jan.
1, 1900. After the date of each of the conjunctions I will list the
numbers of years, months and days from one conjunction to the next. I
will also list them in blocks of 10 conjunctions each for easier
study.

Chapter 10-Gann's Cube

On page 112 of the "old" course (section 10, Master Charts, page 2, Square
of Nine in the "new" course), Gann speaks of the 20-year cycle and
a division by nine. He also speaks of the Cube of 9 which is 729 or
the square of 27. Is it possible that Gann is speaking about the
Mars-Jupiter cycle?

There are at least two other possibilities for the cube, one
involving the moon and the other involving Venus. But since this is a
discussion of Mars, let's follow that line and wait for another time
to discuss the other two.

From the list of the conjunctions we can see that they are
approximately 27 months apart. The square of the 27 months would be
729 months or the cube of 9x9x9. In years that's 60 years and nine
months. That's approximately three cycles of the Jupiter-Saturn
conjunctions.

Dividing those 729 months by 3 we get 243 months or as Gann
says, three squares of nine (9x9x3). The 243 months divided by 9 is
27 months. But by dropping off three months and getting 240 or 20
years, Gann does a little gear shifting and divides this number by 9
and gets 26.666 degrees or months. He also calls it 40 degrees or
one-ninth of a circle so his "circle" at this point must be 20 years.

This "20-year" cycle or Jupiter-Saturn cycle is claimed by some
writers to be Gann's "master time factor." They could very well be
right but I believe the jury is still out on that one and a
discussion on that will be left for another time.

Getting back to our Mars-Jupiter cycles we can see by our list
of conjunctions that none of them run to 27 months. They run two
years, two months and a fraction of a month. Two years is 24 months.
And when we add the other two months we get 26 months and then we are
left with several days over.

Gann's division of the 20 years or 240 months by 9 is two years,
two months and two-thirds of a month or 20 days.

I divided the conjunctions in blocks of 10 to show that this
represents approximately 20 years. We can see from No.1, Dec. l7,
1901 to No. 10, Nov. 27, 1921 is just short of 20 years by 20 days.
From No. 1 to No. 10 is 9 cycles.

This then would suggest that the 9 conjunctions of Mars and
Jupiter are the "40-degree" periods of the 360-degree 20-year period.

It could be that the Jupiter-Saturn period of almost 20 years
forms the major cycle and the Mars-Jupiter conjunctions form the
divisions of that cycle.

You can check the cycles by picking a number such as 3 and going
down to 12 to get the 9 cycles of approximately 20 years.
                                                                             16
You will note that the cycle from No. 14 to No. 15 is rather
long running over 32 months. I'm not an astronomer nor an astrologer
but I would suspect that the reason was that both planets had
retrograde and direct motions at almost the same time.

You will also note that there were conjunctions at No. 37 and
No. 38 shortly after the conjunction at No. 36. The faster moving
Mars went retrograde (appears to move backwards as seen from earth)
after its conjunction on Dec. 12. 1979. In moving backwards it came
back to the same degree as Jupiter on Feb. 25, 1980. It moved on back
for awhile and then went direct and on May 5, 1980 it caught Jupiter
again and moved on.



Chapter 11-Cycles of Other Years

By looking over the various dates and comparing them with
similar dates, you can see that there are "close date" cycles other
than the 20-year cycles.

I have taken the dates in order and compared them with dates
down the list that were within 30 days either side of the date and
noted the years. For example I can see that from Dec. 17, 1901 to
Dec. 1, 1948 is 47 years. The time is 16 days short of 47 years. I
have noted that in the table below with (-16). Where the date was
more than an exact time period I noted it with a plus sign. For
example from Dec. 17, 1901 to Dec. 29, 1959 is 58 years with 12 days
beyond Dec. 17.

So, let's look over those dates and then we will have another
comment from Gann and see if we can tie something together. (The
numbers before each date correspond to the numbers of the list in
Chapter 9).

Chapter 12-Other Cycles

We can see from the preceding list that Mars-Jupiter form other
yearly cycles in addition to the 20-year cycle. You will note that
there are a number of 27 and 47-year cycles. Looking at No. 2, Feb.
26, 1904 we can see that going to No. 11 is 20 years and going to No.
23 is 47 years and then under No. 11 we can see that going to 23 is
27 years.

Subtracting No. 11 from No. 23 we can see that it takes 12
cycles to make 27 years. If it takes 12 cycles to make 27 years then
each cycle must be 27 months. So we can say we have 27 cycles of 12
months or 12 cycles of 27 months.

Now let's look at page 112 of the "old" course again under the Square
of Nine (Section 10, Master Charts, page 3, Square of 9 in the "new"
course). Gann talks about the fourth square of 9 or 9x9x4 which is
324, the square of 18. He mentions that a change in cycles is
indicated here. The number 324 is 4 times 81. It is also the square
of 18 but if you keep figuring you will see that it is 12 times 27 or
324 months is 27 years.

It could be that the change in cycles here is going from a 27-
year cycle to a 20-year cycle and, when added together, becomes the
47-year cycle.

The 325 that he mentions with the 45 degree angle crossing
                                                                        20
involves two triangular numbers, the number 9 and the number 1. This
will be discussed in another book in this series as a discussion here
would take us far afield.
It should be noted that 324 is on the top line in the square of
12 as in Gann's 12x12 chart. It is at the end of the third row in the
third square. The first square ends at 144, the second at 288 and 324
is 36 in the third square. Gann also notes that it is 36 less than
360.

Before we leave this I will comment on something that you will
probably notice and wonder about. In the later years of the cycles of
27 years, there are more than 12 cycles in those 27 years. Subtract
No. 26 from No. 40 and we can see that there are 14 cycles instead of
12 in that series. Here again this is probably caused by the
retrograde and direct motions of the planets.
I will also note another thing. Other writers have made lots of
comments about the 60-year cycle and I'm sure many expected the
market to crash in l989 or 60 years from the l929 crash, but it came
in l987 or 58 years after 1929.

I'm sure you have noticed there are many 58-year cycles in the
list!



Chapter 13: Heliocentric Conjunctions of M-J

Since I laid out the Square of 144 heliocentric style and since
Gann appeared to use both geo and helio, I will list the heliocentric
dates:

1. Nov. 25, 1901
2. Feb. 4, 1904

7. April 13, 1915
8. June 29, 1917
9. Oct. 9, 1919
10. Jan 17, 1922

11. April 12, 1924
12. June 21, 1926

39. Oct. 20, 1986
40. Jan. 10. 1989

41. April 24, 199l
42. Aug. 2, 1993
43. Oct. 2l, l995
44. Dec. 27, 1997

By studying the two listings we can see that at times the
heliocentric comes a few months before the geocentric and at other
times after the geocentric.

Looking at No. 1 in both listings we can see that the helio
conjunction occurred on Nov. 25, 1901 and the geo on Dec. 17, 1901.

The helio occurs first at No. 2, 3 and 4. Then at No. 5 the geo
occurs first at Nov. 5 followed by the helio on Nov. 17. Then the geo
always comes first for about 23 years where the helio comes first at
No. 15. Then at No. 25 and 26 you can see that they change again
about 23 years later. (If there is a significance to the number 23 I
have not found it yet, but I'll keep searching.)

When Gann marked the planets on his well known soybean chart the
helio occurred on Nov. 6, 1948 and the geo on Dec. 1, 1948, a 25-day
difference or the square of 5.

Did Gann favor one method over the other? That's difficult to say
based on his writings known thus far.



Chapter 14-"Mars Alone" Method

There is at least one piece of evidence that Gann used a single
planet method. In his "private papers" he applies helio Mars to
cotton. You might have had the same difficulty I had recognizing this
sheet. I went over it a number of times thinking it referred to
                                                                        22
coffee as I had misread his handwriting.

It finally dawned on me that the first date, June 9, 1932,
represented the low in cotton. It refers to cotton, not coffee!

On the sheet Gann notes that on June 9, 1932 Mars helio was at 1
degree in the sign of Taurus or 31 degrees from the zero point of
Aries. Those checking this sheet should note that there are a few
errors.

(Yes, Gann did make mistakes!)

He goes on to number the cycles when Mars returns to the same
degree in Taurus. He might have been just doing some calculations in
his head instead of checking a helio ephemeris.

When he notes that Mars returned to the same place in the
cycle, he marks the month and year. But in checking the information I
found that the months are not always right. At the fourth cycle even
the year is wrong.

He calls it December, 1940.

To be exact, it was Dec. 18, 1939, not 1940, when Mars helio was
at the first degree in Taurus.

After 10 cycles are made he notes that this is 10 times 360
degrees or 3600. On May 3, 1952 he gets exact again noting that Mars
is at 11 degrees Scorpio or 22l degrees in absolute degrees.

This is 190 degrees from 1 degree Taurus or 31 degrees. So, on
May 3, 1952 Mars is at 3790 as we add the 3600 degrees of the 10
cycles to its present position from 1 degree in Taurus.

Why he took this particular date to note that, I don't know. As
a cotton price it would seem that he expected cotton to be at 37.90
cents per pound on that date.

On the same page he does a workout in the same manner from the
low of Dec. 10, 1938. There are some minor errors here too, but the
idea is the same. He also brings this workout up to May 3, 1952 which
is 7 cycles of 360 degrees plus 40 degrees or 2560.

From June 9, 1932 he also brings the workout up to March 8, 1951
and to Nov. 9, 1951. Not knowing the prices from those dates I can't
tell you if he was successful or not but it does show he used a
single planet helio system.

Did he really have something here or was he just doodling? Only
a close check of cotton prices at that time would provide us with an
answer.




                                                                        23
Chapter 15-Mars Left Out?

In his paper "Soy Beans, Price Resistance Levels" Gann says that
the average of the planets, both heliocentric and geocentric should
be used as they are powerful points for price and time resistance.

Also the average of the five major planets with Mars left out
is of great importance and should be watched.

Why leaving out Mars is of great importance, he doesn't say but
is a line of study that should be investigated.

Note: On another sheet he terms the "Mars Out" approach as the
"Mean of 5."

Gann did apply the cycle of Mars to coffee (as I said earlier
the one I thought was coffee turned out to be cotton).

In his paper of March 19, 1954 on coffee he talks about the
geocentric cycles of Mars, noting that not only were the complete
cycles important such as 9 and 12, but also half cycles such as 7 1/2
cycles.

Seven cycles of Mars heliocentric is approximately 13 years and is
possibly where he gets his 13-year cycle. In one paper he combines
the 13-year cycle with the number 44 and both 7 and 44 are pyramid
numbers (we will look at that in another book.)



Chapter 16-Earth-Mars 47-Year Cycle

We have already noticed that there is a Mars-Jupiter cycle of 47
years, possibly a combination of the 20-year cycle and the 27-year
cycle.

There is also an Earth-Mars heliocentric cycle or Sun-Mars
geocentric cycle of 47 years. I know it might sound strange to call
the Earth-Mars cycle heliocentric but it must be remembered that this
is viewing Earth-Mars as if you stand where the sun stands. In the
geocentric we are standing on the earth and viewing the Sun-Mars
cycle.

I will list one 47-year heliocentric cycle and then we will have
a look at it to see if we can discover anything else. I use
heliocentric because it is a little easier to work with as there is
no retrograde of planets under this system.

This time I will list the signs and the degrees in which the
conjunctions are made to see if we can learn something there:

1. Feb. 23, 1901 3 Virgo
2. March 30, 1903 8 Libra
3. May 9, 1905 17 Scorpio
                                                                        24
4. July 7, 1907 13 Capricorn
5. Sept. 25, 1909 1 Aires
6. Nov. 26, 1911 2 Gemini
7. Jan. 6, 1914 14 Cancer
8. Feb. 11, 1916 20 Leo
9. March 16,1918 24 Virgo
10. April 22, 1920 1 Scorpio

11. June 11, 1922 19 Sagitarius
12. Aug. 14, 1924 0 Pices
13. Nov. 5, 1926 11 Taurus
14. Dec. 22, 1928 29 Gemini
15. Jan. 28, 1931 7 Leo
16. March 2, 1933 10 Virgo
17. April 7, 1935 16 Libra
18. May 20, 1937 27 Scorpio
19. July 24, 1939 0 Aquarious
20. Oct. 11, 194l 17 Aires

21. Dec. 6, 1943 13 Gemini
22. Jan. 15, 1946 24 Cancer
23. Feb. 18, 1948 28 Leo

The first thing we can see about this series is that it takes 22
conjunctions to make up this 47-year cycle. Unlike the number 23 I do
know a few things about the number 22.

It is the number of Robert Gordon's name when figured by a
system of numerology. Gordon was the hero of Gann's book "The Tunnel
Thru the Air." There are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet and there
are 22 chapters in the book of "Revelations." It also took 22 years
for the initiates of Ancient Egypt to go through the "mysteries" of
that country. It is also a pyramid number.

It is one of the master numbers in numerology. It is a Teleois
number and its triangle is a Teleois angle.

This is not the place for any further discussion of the number
22, even though Gann did mention its triangle. I just wanted to note
it here as a point of interest.

By checking No. 1 and No. 8 we can see that there is a fairly
close seven-year cycle. But by checking multiples of seven, going
down to No. 15 and then to No. 22, the dates drift farther apart.

By checking No. 5, 12 and 19 though we can see another
interesting point. The conjunctions are made 30 degrees apart, one
sign earlier each time.

Since 47 years is 564 months, we can divide that by 22 cycles
and see that the average length of each conjunction is 25.66 months.
I say average because some conjunctions are longer than others.

By looking at the list again we can see that conjunctions are
longer as they near Aires, the zero point in the zodiac and shorter
                                                                        25
as they near Libra or the 180 degree point.

That's because the planets do not run in exact circles but in an
elliptical path and the sun does not sit at the exact center of the
paths. This makes the planets run closer to the sun at some points
and farther away at others. As they get nearer the sun they run
faster and when they get farther away they run slower.

As a result, like the Earth and Mars example, it takes the
Earth longer to catch Mars at some points then it does at others.

We have looked at the cycle of Mars, both heliocentric and
geocentric. I have shown you how some of the numbers of Mars compare
to some of the numbers in the Gann material. I have shown how the
heliocentric place of Mars was the same at some of the turning points
in the soybean chart.

I also noted how the number 132 seemed to be an operative number. I
also noted that the operative number might be 133 for other reasons.
We will explore those reasons in an upcoming book. Even with this
operative number, 133, the number 56 pops up again in a rather
convincing form!




                                                                        26
Book II
The Great Cycle

Chapter 1: Quick Review of Book I.

In Book I, "The Cycle of Mars," I noted how I had placed the
Square of 144 on Gann's weekly bean chart of the late 1940's and
early 1950's and told how I found nothing too interesting until I
placed the lines of the planets, figured by the heliocentric method,
on it.

We saw that when this chart begins on Jan. 15, 1948 Mars crossed
Pluto at 133 degrees. I noted that the figure could be 132 since this
is a weekly chart and Mars moves approximately 1 degree in two days.

I showed that by subtracting 360 degrees from the high of 436 in
the manner of Gann we arrive at the number 76. I showed that if we
start at 436 and keep subtracting 76 we arrive with a remainder of 56
and we made five subtractions.

The number five was important to Gann and its importance is
also hinted at in astrological and Biblical material as well as in
Masonry. We will look at that number in its appropriate place, but
will not go far afield now.

We saw that 56 weeks was the time from the high in January,
1948 to the low in February, 1949. It was noted that 56 plus 76
equals 132. We also saw that if we start with 436 and start
subtracting 56 until we subtract it seven times we end up with a
remainder of 44.

The number 44 is not just the low on soybeans in 1932, but like
the number five it pops up in other ways in the work of Gann, is a
pyramid number, etc. I showed how 56, 44, 76 and another number, 68,
combined to form other numbers in the chart in question.

Since I did that in Book I, I will not repeat it here.

Before I discovered the relationships of the numbers above I was
intrigued by the fact that Mars crossed Pluto at 133. If the length
of the chart is 266 weeks and not 267, then 133 forms the inner
square of a square which is 266x266.

The number 266 catches our eye as we recognize it from Gann's
book "The Tunnel Thru the Air." This number is mentioned on page 82
and he says it is the number of a pope. That I have never figured

                                                                        27
out. That's about as elusive (and probably as misleading) as the
"number of the beast" in the Book of Revelations.

There are some writers who think the number 266 is a reference
to the Galactic Center which is 266 degrees in the zodiac. They could
very well be right.

But I believe there is the possibility of another answer. One
that deals not only with 266, but also 133 as they are both part and
parcel of a "great cycle."

There are a number of "great cycles." On page 115 of the
"old"commodity course (section 10, #2 M.C. in the "new "commodity
course), Gann uses 90x90 and the square of the 360 degree
circle. There is a glaring error here which will be discovered by
anyone who carefully studies this section. As I noted earlier even
Gann made mistakes. We will look at that error at a later date.

The square of 144x144 or the fourth power of the zodiac could be
another great cycle. Take the total square in days and turn the days
into years, months, etc.

Some writers believe that the Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions of
nearly 20 years or multiples of them are great cycles or master time
factors.

I have no quarrel with any of the above.



Chapter 2-An Ancient Book
But I found a "great cycle" in an ancient book and its
application to the chart of beans of the late 1940's and early 1950's
may not be conclusive, but I think you will agree with me that the
findings are highly interesting. (There's that word again.)

One reason that the findings are highly interesting is the fact
that Gann hints at this ancient book in "The Tunnel Thru the Air."

Let's look at a quote from that ancient book:

"And it goes through the western gates in the order and number
of the eastern, and accomplishes the three hundred and sixty five and
a quarter days of the solar year, while the lunar year has three
hundred and fifty-four, and there are wanting to it twelve days of
the solar circle, which are the lunar epacts of the whole year.

"(Thus, too, the great cycle contains five hundred and thirty-
two years.)

"The quarter of a day is omitted for three years, the fourth
fulfils it exactly.

"Therefore they are taken outside of heaven for three years and
                                                                        28
are not added to the number of days, because they change the time of
the years to two new months towards completion, to two others toward
dimunition.

"And when the western gates are finished, it returns and goes to
the eastern to the lights, and goes thus day and night about the
heavenly circles, lower than all circles, swifter than the heavenly
winds, and spirits and elements and angels flying; each angel has six
wings.

"It has a sevenfold course in 19 years."

We can see that this ancient writer was talking about a "modern
day" calendar. In ancient times the calendar had gotten out of kilter
when they used 365 days in a year. When it was determined that the
solar year was about 1/4 day longer they had to adjust it. This is
his reference to taking the quarter day to heaven for three years and
fulfilling it in the fourth year.

But what is this "great circle" of 532 years?

And what is this "sevenfold course in 19 years?

If we divide 532 by 19 years we get 28. I had read in this
ancient book also about a 28-year sun cycle, but was not sure what it
meant.

I mulled over this for quite awhile until it dawned on me to
simply look up the word "calendar" in an encyclopedia. For those who
do not want to look it up, I will explain it before we get back to
the 267-week chart.



Chapter 3-The Cycle of the Sun
First, let's look at the cycle of the sun and why it is called a
28-year cycle.

It takes 28 years for the day of the week and the day of the
month to repeat the same PATTERN. This can be seen if you look at a
universal calendar, sometimes found in the middle of telephone books,
or in your ephemeris.

The sun does not go 360 degrees in 360 days. The solar year of
360 degrees take approximately 365.2422, or as we say, 365 1/4 days.
We use 365 days to represent a year and then throw in a day every
four years to make up for the 1/4 day as the ancient writer
suggested.

That extra day every four years keeps our birthdays from
falling exactly on consecutive days each year.

Let's take a birthday and follow it through to see how long it
takes to get it back to the same cycle of falling on certain days of
                                                                        29
the week.

Let's take for our example the birthday of Robert Gordon, the
hero of "The Tunnel Thru the Air." Robert Gordon was born on June 9,
1906, which was on a Saturday.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year and a week is a cycle of 7
days then the same day of the week will repeat at the end of 52x7 or
364 days. Then on the 365th day we will arrive a day following the
original day.

So we check June 6, 1907 and find that it is on Sunday, or on a
day following the original day. In June of 1908 we find that the 9th
falls on Tuesday. Hey, wait a minute! The PATTERN is broken. And you
know what I said about watching PATTERNS. First the birthday was on
Saturday, then on Sunday and now on Tuesday. What happened to Monday?

Checking back we find that 1908 was a leap year and there was a
Feb. 29th and this pushed the cycle of days ahead by one day. Let's
go on. The birthday in 1909 was on Wednesday, in 1910 on Thursday,
19ll on Friday. In 1912, another leap year, it skipped Saturday and
went to Sunday. Now that we have the idea lets do a workout of not
only 28, but 56 years so that we can see how the cycle repeats.

All the dates below are for the birthday of June 9:

(28)1933-Friday------------------------- (56)1961-Friday

In the preface to this series of books I stated that we must
constantly look for PATTERNS. So let's look for the PATTERN here.

Robert Gordon was born on Saturday. His next birthday on a
Saturday was in 19l7, 11 years later. The years 1907 and 1918, 11
years later, are both on Sunday. But 1908 and 1919 are not the same,
so there is no 11-year PATTERN.

We can check out the other dates in the same manner. It is not
until we reach a 28-year cycle that the days repeat the same PATTERN.
Go across from any row in column one to the same row in column two,
which is a difference of 28 years, and you will have the same day.

Like me, you might have wondered why it takes 28 years to make
the cycle. Since there are seven days in a week, it would seem that
it would only need 7 years.

The reason it takes 28 years is because of the "leap days." A
day is added at Feb. 29 every four years. Since the "leap day" has to
occupy each of the days of the week, it will take 4x7 or 28 years to
complete the cycle.

There is an interesting observation to be made by checking the
days of the week which are occupied or occur on Feb. 29.

Let's look at the first seven leap years listed above and see
what day of the week Feb. 29 occupies:

(1) Feb. 29, 1908-Saturday
(2) Feb. 29, 1912-Thursday
(3) Feb. 29, 1916-Tuesday
(4) Feb. 29, 1920-Sunday
(5) Feb. 29, 1924-Friday
(6) Feb. 29, 1928-Wednesday
(7) Feb. 29, 1932-Monday

As we can see, each of the seven days are occupied, but not in
order. And here is where we make our interesting observation. The
days advance by five days.

From Saturday to Thursday is five days, from Thursday to Tuesday
is five days, etc. Checking Robert Gordon's personal leap days we can
see that they are Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday,
Saturday and Thursday, also advancing by five days each time.

Oh! There's that number five again. But this is not a discussion
about five so let's move on.


Chapter 4-The Cycle of the Moon
We have learned what the ancient writer meant about the 28-year
cycle of the sun, or the cycle of the days of the week and the day of
                                                                        31
the month. Now let us look for the 19-year cycle of the moon.

Checking Robert Gordon's birthday of June 9, 1906, we see that
the moon was in the 16th degree of Capricorn. Nineteen years later on
June 9, 1925 the moon was in the 17th degree of Capricorn. Nineteen
years after that on June 9, 1944, the moon was in the 16th degree of
Capricorn.

So in 19 years on the same day of the month, the moon returns
to its same place in the zodiac. (Figured from the same hour. In this
case from the midnight ephemeris. Have to figure from the same hour
as the moon moves approximately 13 degrees a day.)

This works for any day. Your birthday, mine, an anniversary of
an event. It works for any degree the moon is in or full moons, new
moons, etc.

For instance, let's check a full moon. Three days before Robert
Gordon's birthday on June 6, 1906 there was a full moon in the 15th
degree of Sagittarius. On June 6, 1925 there was a full moon in the
15th degree of Sagittarius. On June 6, 1944 there was a full moon in
the 15th degree of Sagittarius.

So we have found that the 19-year cycle of the moon brings it
back to the same degree in the zodiac on the same day of a particular
month 19 years later.

Notice I said same day of the month not the same day of the
week.



Chapter 5-The 532-Year Cycle
What then is the 532-year cycle?

It is the cycle that brings the moon not only back to the same
day of the month but also to the same day of the week.

How does it do that?

The 532-year cycle is both 19 cycles of 28 years and 28 cycles
of 19 years. (Cycle of cycles will be explained in more detail in an
upcoming book.)

Checking our full moon example we see that June 6, 1906 was on
Wednesday. June 6, l925 was on Saturday. June 6, 1944 was on Tuesday.
If we figure 532 years from any of those dates, the day of the week,
the day of the month and the moon's position will be the same.

Those familiar with World War II will recognize that June 6,
1944 was VE Day, the invasion of Normandy. If that event was
recreated 532 years from that date or June 6, 2476 it would be on
Tuesday and there would be a full moon in the 15th degree of
Sagittarius.
                                                                        32
I must add that astronomers will tell you that that figure will
be slightly off base. Because of certain astronomical phenomenon,
which does not need to the explained here, the moons position could
be just a little off, but the idea is right.


Chapter 6: Back to the Bean Chart
All very interesting, you say, but what does this have to do
with the soybean chart of the late 1940's and early 1950's. Remember
that I said that the number 266 and 133 were part and parcel of a
great cycle.

When we divide 532 by 2 we get 266 and when we divide by 4 we
get 133!

"Whoa," you say. "This is a 532-year cycle and Gann's chart was
weeks."

But we must remember that when Gann referred to his charts, he
said they were in days, weeks, months, degrees, prices, difference in
prices, etc. To which I might add minutes, hours, years, etc.

With a little figuring we can see that 532 years is also
365.2422 cycles of 532 days and 266 weeks is 3.5 cycles of 532 days.

Since I am now dealing with the number 133 and not 132 and since
132 was the total of 56 and 76 does that negate everything I said
about those two numbers in Book I?

No, it doesn't!

We saw that the 532-year cycle is made by multiplying 19 times
28. The number 56 is 2x28. And the number 76 is 4x19.

Try this. Divide 532 by the "sacred" number 7 and see what you
get.

Yes, it's 76. Is it merely coincidence that Halley's comet
returns every 76 years or at the end of four moon cycles?

The time from the January, 1948 high to the May low was 38 weeks
which is one-half of 76 or 2x19. I will not go through all the other
relationships between 56 and 76 in the chart as that was covered
thoroughly in Book I, "The Cycle of Mars."

Earlier I noted that 436 minus 7x56 is 44. From Gann's 15-hour,
24-day chart we know that the square of 24 is 576 or 4 times 144.
When we subtract the "great cycle" of the sun and moon, 532,
from the square of 24 or 4 times 144, what do we get?

576-532=44!

Another coincidence? Again, I must note that the number 44 is
                                                                        33
more than just the low on cash soybeans in 1932.

If you are still not convinced that the numbers 19 and 28 are
important and that their occurrence is more than coincidence, look
over Gann's list of the 38 columns in chapter seven of the commodity
course.

You should lay out the columns as listed, but until you do, here
are a few excerpts, listed according to weeks.

2-15-1920 to 12-28-1932---672 weeks or 24x28 or 12x56
2-15-1920 to 12-20-1939---1036 weeks or 37x28
2-15-1920 to 4-21-1952----1680 weeks or 60x28
12-28-1932 to 4-21-1952---1008 weeks or 36x28 or 7x144
11-26-1948 to 5-8-1950----76 weeks or 4x19
8-24-1949 to 12-28-1949---19 weeks
8-24-1949 to 5-8-1950-----38 weeks or 2x19

I have not done a complete workout on all 703 numbers (the
triangle of 37) in these 38 columns, but I'm sure there would be a
number of other examples of the multiples of 19 and 28.

Both numbers are Teleois and one is triangular. These topics
will be dealt with in an upcoming book.

I have not made mention in either Book I or Book II of the
"golden mean" or the Fibonacci numbers, but I will leave you with
this one last coincidence.

Let's square 56. 56x56=3136

Let's square 44. 44x44=1936

Now let's divide 3136 by 1936

3136/1936=1.6198347

Do I really have to comment?




                                                                       34
Book III
The Book With No Name
 Like the song with the line "the horse with no name," I have
chosen to call this little book "The Book With No Name."

The reason being that the idea presented here does not fall into
any easy category.

Although it might have been presented along with a general
discussion of the Square of Nine chart, the Teleois or the triangular
numbers, it seems to fit best here following the information
presented in Book I-"The Cycle of Mars" and Book II-"The Great
Cycle."

In Book I, I showed how I placed the Square of 144 on the weekly
chart of soybeans from the late 1940's and early 1950's and did not
learn much of anything until I placed the heliocentric positions of
the planets on the chart.

I noted in Book I that when soybeans reached their high of 436
in January, 1948, the planet Mars was crossing Pluto. The crossing
during that week could have been at either 133 or 132 degrees. In
Book I, I explained some of the possible number combinations if the
crossing was at 132 and in Book II, regarding the "Great Cycle," I
noted other combinations if the crossing was at 133.

In addition to the "Great Cycle" there is another reason why I
thought the crossing was more likely at 133.

In Book I, I made the following statement, presented here in
parentheses.

(Did you look at the planetary positions on Jan 15, l948 and
find something interesting? If you did not, try comparing the number
of Mars with the other planets. Now what did you find? Correct. You
found Mars and Pluto at conjunction at 133.

(That's an interesting number because of its relationship to a
number in "The Tunnel Thru the Air," Gann's novel, and to the "Great
Cycle." But that's another work for another time and there is no need
to go down that path now.

(It is also interesting because of its position on the Square of
Nine chart in relationship to the triangle of the Teleois and their
relationship to a paragraph in Gann's discussion of planetary
resistance lines on soybeans in his "private papers." In the "new"
course see Section 8, Soy Beans, Price Resistance Levels)

It should be noted that I have already discussed the number 133
                                                                        35
and its relationship to the "Great Cycle" in Book II of this series,
"The PATTERNS of Gann."

It is that last paragraph quoted above that I will deal with
now.

First, we must read that paragraph in Gann's discussion of
planetary resistance lines on soybeans in his "private papers." In
fact you should read the paragraph several times before proceeding
with this book to see if you detect a

PATTERN

or a "lack" of one. I had read that paragraph many times before
I learned to look for PATTERNS. And if I had not learned to look for
them, the paragraph would have had no significance.

So here is your chance to put to work your search for

PATTERN

The paragraph in question is located at the bottom of page one
and continues to the top of page two.

Did you read it? Several times? Notice anything unusual? If not
give it a good try before moving on.

Got it now?

In this paragraph he is subtracting parts of the circle from the
high on soybeans, 436 3/4. All the parts he subtracts are natural
numbers (a number without a fraction or decimal) except for one, 236
1/4.

It was this number which caught my eye.

Why did it catch my eye? Why should it have caught yours?

Remember in the introduction to this series and in many other
places in this work I said we would be watching for

PATTERN

This number stood out because it was "outside" the PATTERN. It
was the only number in the group not a natural number!

It is also the number that Gann subtracts from 436 3/4 and gets
the low on soybeans 56 weeks later.

Let's write that number down and put it aside for awhile:

236 1/4 or 236.25

Now look at page 115 of the "old" commodity course (Section 10
#2 M.C. of the "new" course) and read the paragraph on
                                                                       36
the divisions of the circle.

Although there are times when Gann divides the circle into
smaller parts, here he ends with the division by 64 which give 5.625
or 5 5/8. So let's write that number down with the other number.

236.25, 5.625

Let's also put down our planetary position which was 133.

236.25, 5.625, 133

Now this is the part which intrigued me. The time from the high
of 436 to the low was 56 weeks. This can also be read as 13 months.
The triangle of 13 is 13x7 or 91.

Check the positions of 133 and 91 on the Square of Nine chart.
They are next to each other on the same angle. I will now put down
the four numbers discussed above and see if you can make a PATTERN.
236.25, 5.625, 133, 91

Give up? Subtract 91 from 133 and try again.

133-91=42. Now do you have it?

If you said subtracting 91 from 133 gives 42 and 42 times 5.625
equals:

236.25

you are correct!

A coincidence?

Maybe. You have noticed that I made much of the number 56 in
Book I and Book II. That was the number of weeks from the high in
1948 to the low in 1949.

If we divide the triangle of 56 by the number of months in a
year or the signs in the zodiac we arrive back at

133!

our planetary crossing!

Another coincidence? Again, maybe. But the coincidences noted in
Books I, II and III are certainly piling up.




                                                                       37
Book IV
On The Square

Chapter 1-How Do You Make a Square?
"Do you know how to make squares?"

This is a question I put to a friend recently, a man who had
been studying Gann much longer than I had.

He thought for a few seconds and replied, "No, I don't guess I
really do."

I had expected what he would say. My friend is no dummy. His
answer showed no lack of intelligence. If you don't know the answer,
that does not show a lack of yours. I would have said the same thing
a few years ago.

Ask 100 persons in downtown New York and you would probably get
the same results. Ask doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs. You might get
a couple of right answers from mathematicians. And again you might
not.

Someone might get down on the sidewalk with a piece of chalk and
draw a box. You would say to them, "That's a nice picture of a
square, but how do you make squares? More specifically, how do you
make the "natural squares" in order?

And here we will have to pause to answer a question before we go
on. We are going to have to answer the question, "What is a natural
square?" before we go on to make them.

When Gann used the term "natural square" I had an inclination to
ask out loud, "What is an unnatural square? A square is a square.
What is natural or unnatural about it?" I would ask it in the same
way that when someone starts talking about a "right angle" I want to
ask them about a left angle or a wrong angle.

The answer came when I went through a book on modern math. The
"natural numbers" or as some other books put it, the "counting
numbers" are simply the series 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. These are numbers
that back in my school days the teacher probably called "whole
numbers." That is, numbers without fractions or decimals. But in
present day modern math terms the name "whole numbers" is applied to
the same series with the exception that the series contains the zero
and is made thus: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. More about the number 1 and 0
in the Gann material, but for now we will stick to the "natural
numbers."

                                                                       38
Since 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. are the "natural numbers" then the
"natural squares" are the squares made from these natural numbers.
One could build a swimming pool 67.5 by 67.5 feet and have a square
swimming pool, but it would not be a swimming pool made of natural
squares since the natural numbers do not have fractional numbers. The
swimming pool could be 67 by 67 or 68 by 68 or any other non-
fractional number and be a natural square.

Although we may be tempted to use the term "whole number" to
differentiate from the fractional numbers, remember that we found
that the whole number series contains the zero and in Gann's work
there is no 0 times 0 as can be seen from his Square of Nine and
Square of Four charts. We will find out why later on.

So now we have learned what a natural number is and what a
natural square is. (By "we" I mean me and all the non-mathematicians
in the crowd.)

Let's go back to our original question: "How do you make the
natural squares in order numerically? I am adding that new word
"numerically" to let you know we are not drawing squares, we are
dealing with them only as numbers.

Well, you might say, we could make them simply by multiplying
the natural numbers by themselves (find the second power) in order.

Yes, we could do that and we would have:

1x1 is 1
2x2 is 4
3x3 is 9, etc.

And we would certainly have a PATTERN.

I talked about PATTERNS in the preface and in the other books in
this series, but let's pause again for another word about PATTERN.

The PATTERN we seek is one that when established it will be easy
to supply the next step in the PATTERN.

For example, if I listed the numbers 100, 99-1/2, 99, 98-1/2,
etc. and asked you to supply the next step you probably would say 98.

That's because you noticed that there is a PATTERN that starts
with 100 and counts backwards in increments of one-half.

If I gave the series of 1x2, 2x3, 3x4 and asked you for the next
step you would say 4x5 because you saw a PATTERN with each natural
number multiplying the next in order. (We will learn the meaning of
this particular PATTERN in this book and how it stands on the Square
of Nine chart.)

Looking back at the multiplication of the natural numbers by
themselves to make squares we can see that the next step would be
4x4, 5x5, etc. because we saw the PATTERN.
                                                                        39
So we can make the natural squares by multiplication of the
natural numbers by themselves in order and have a recognizable
PATTERN.

But it does not answer a point made by Gann!

In his discussion of the natural squares, he mentions the "gain
of two." Actually he says "this produces a variable in time and price
of 2." See page 154 of the commodity course. (For those of you who
have newer copies of the course look under "Master Price and Time
Chart, Squares 1 to 33 Inclusive, Price and Time 1 to 1089, first
paragraph.)

What is this "variable of two" concerning the squares? In all of
my books I intend to name chapter and verse when I deal with the
numbers of Gann. This is one of those times. Writers who talk about
the Gann material in a general way are not being honest with their
readers, especially if they are asking for some big money for that
general information.
Looking at our multiplication table of the squares we cannot see
this "variable of two."

The "variable of two" remained a mystery to me for a long time,
as maybe it has for you. Was it possibly a gain of two around the
corners of the squares on the Square of Nine chart? I decided to make
the squares myself from scratch to see if I could discover something.
The following is my workout. It provides "one" of the constructions
of the Square of Nine chart.


Chapter 2-Building the Squares

My first step was to take one square and place it in the middle
as Gann had done and draw in its two diagonals.

To build the odd squares along the diagonal which would include
the 1 and the other odd squares, 9, 25, etc. and go from top right to
bottom left would require that the second number be to the immediate
left of the first. The two diagonals would be extended and their four
points would be 90 degrees apart. So far, so good. Just like Gann.
Look at your Square of Nine chart and follow along.

Since the 1 is on the bottom left diagonal (the 315 degree line
or angle) it will take us two units to get to the next diagonal or
the 45 degree line. (Some might associate the 1 with what is called
the March line on the chart, but I believe the 315 angles is correct
and will be dealt with later on in this material.)

Instead of numbering in order as the chart is numbered, I
numbered the units between the lines so I numbered 2 and 3 as 1, 2.
It took two more units to go from that 45 degree diagonal to the next
diagonal (135 degree line) so I numbered them 1, 2. To the next
diagonal I numbered 1, 2 and back to the original diagonal I
                                                                        40
numbered 1, 2.

From the original diagonal (315 degrees) it now took four units
to get to the next diagonal (45 degree line) and four to the next
(135 degree line) and four to the next (225 degree line) and four
back to the starting point again (315 degree line). I numbered these
1 to 4 respectively. On the Square of Nine chart this would end up at
25.

Then it took six units to get to the 45 degree line, 6 to the
next diagonal, six to the next and six back to the original line,
ending at 49.

A PATTERN emerged. Every odd square built around the square of 1
was four times the even numbers in order. Beginning with 1 we added
four 2's to end at 9, then we added four 4's to end at 25 and then we
added four 6's to end at 49.

Could this be the "variable of two" or the "gain of two" that
Gann mentioned, the gain between the even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
etc. which were used to build each side of the squares as they moved
outward from the center?

Interesting. But one nagging problem remained.

The Number 1!

There was a PATTERN of each side gaining two. But the 1 itself broke the PATTERN. It was only
1 unit between the angles and going
from 1 unit to 2 units was a gain of only one unit.

I was not as PATTERN-minded then as I am now so regardless of
that little nagging problem I believed I was on the right track.

I reread the section on the squares many times. I couldn't fit
my thinking to what Gann was saying.

He spoke of the even number squares being on a 45 degree line.

Some writers believe he was referring to the 45 degree line
which contains the numbers 5, 17, etc. or that line known as the 135
degree line. (I went along with that for quite sometime since that
seemed the only explanation, but have since learned how dead wrong
that was!)

Putting the idea aside I let it rest for a long time. And then I
found the answer.

In the john!

On the floor!




                                                                                           41
Chapter 3-A Lesson From the John Floor!

The overall title of this set of books is "The PATTERNS
of Gann." It's original title was "Exploring the Numbers of Gann"
since I take you down paths of places I have already explored and
show you what I have found.

But when one leads another on an exploring trip that does not
mean that the one following can't look off to the right and to the
left and see something for himself.

So here I am going to leave you for awhile and let you do some
exploring for yourself.

So while I'm resting you take off down a path and come to a
place where a man is building a house. What strikes your eye is a
pile of square tiles in the yard. You ask him what he is doing and he
says he is going to tile the floor of his new john.

He tells you he is going to take into the house only as many
tiles as needed each time to complete a square.

"Great," you think to yourself. "Now I can see how squares are made."

"Can I watch?" you ask and he says sure he wouldn't mind the company.

So he picks up one square and you follow him into the new john
where he places it on the floor and labels it 1 and under the bottom,
1x1 as shown below:

                                                      1
                                                     1x1

He goes outside for more tiles, brings them in and places the
first above the 1, labels it 2, puts the next to the right of the 2
and labels it 3 and puts the next under the 3 and labels it 4. And
under 4 he writes 2x2 as shown below:

                                                 2         3
                                                 1         4
                                                     2x2

He goes outside again for more tiles. He places one above the 2
and labels it 5 and one above the 3 and labels it 6 and one to the
right of 6 and labels it 7 and under the 7 he places one and labels
it 8 and under the 8 he places another and numbers it 9 and under the
9 he notes that this is 3x3 as shown below:

                                             5        6        7
                                             2        3        8
                                             1        4        9



                                                                        42
                                                      3x3

He gets more tiles. He places one above the 5 and labels it 10,
the next ll, the next 12 and the next 13 and then under l3, he places
three tiles and numbers them 14, 15 and 16 and notes under this that
this is 4x4 as shown below:

                                           10        11        12        13
                                            5         6         7        14
                                            2         3         8        15
                                            1         4         9        16
                                                      4x4

Then he goes outside and gets another group of tiles. He places
one above the 10 and labels this 17 and places more across numbering
them 18, 19, 20 and 21. Under 21 he places the rest and numbers them
down the column 22, 23, 24, and 25 and notes this is 5x5 as shown
below:

                                      17        18        19        20        21
                                      10        11        12        13        22
                                       5         6         7        14        23
                                       2         3         8        15        24
                                       1         4         9        16        25
                                                      5x5

He repeats this process several times, always placing the first
tile at the top left of the preceding square, placing the rest to the
right until he has an open column to go all the way to the bottom and
numbers them in the same manner as before and marking the size of the
square as shown:


                                     26    27        28        29        30        31

You cast your eye along the bottom row and see the figures

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.

You think you see a PATTERN emerging.

Can I renumber all of those tiles?" you ask.

"Sure, I don't care," he says.

So you number the first square he put down as 1:

                                                         1
                                                        1x1

Then you number the next group:

                                                    1         2
                                                    1         3




                                                                                              44

And the next:

                                                 1        2        3
                                                 1        2        4
                                                 1        3        5
                                                         3x3

And the next:

                                             1       2         3       4

                                             1       3         5       7
                                                         4x4

And the next:

                                         1       2        3        4       5
                                         1       2        3        4       6
                                         1       2        3        5       7
                                         1       2        4        6       8
                                         1       3        5        7       9
                                                         5x5

Now you look at the numbers along the bottom, which replaced the
original numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.

"Now I know!" you exclaim. "I really didn't notice how many
tiles the man brought in each time to build the squares even though
he said he was going to bring in just enough to build each square.
Now I can see he brought in 1, then 3, then 5, then 7, etc."

And now you know how to make squares!

TO MAKE THE NATURAL SQUARES IN ORDER YOU SIMPLY ADD THE NATURAL
"ODD" NUMBERS IN ORDER!

Gann's "variable of two!" Each time we add an odd number we are
adding two more than the last time.

1 is 1x1, the square of one. 1 plus 3 is 4, or 2x2. 4 plus 5 is
9 or 3x3. 9 plus 7 is 16, the square of 4, etc.

Watching all that square laying has you pretty tired out so you
go out and use the man's hammock for a couple of hours. But while you
are half-way snoozing you are running some ideas in your mind.

Waking up, you see the gentleman huffing and puffing as he
carries a rather large armload of tiles and heads for the john.

You ask how many tiles he is carrying. He says 65 tiles. You
                                                                               45
say, "Bet I can tell you what square you will be completing when you
place those with the others."

"That's a pretty good trick if you can do it," he says.

"You are making the square of 33 or 33x33 (l089),"
you reply.

"That's exactly right," he says. (He has a pretty big john.)
"How did you do that?"

What did you tell him? You ran those figures through your mind
while you were half asleep, but it was easy. What ever amount is
being used will match the term in the following manner. The "term" is
the number with the period, the square we are making. The amount
added to complete the square is next to it.

1. 1
2. 3
3. 5
4. 7
5. 9
6. 11
7. 13
8. 15
9. 17
10. 19
11. 21
12. 23
13. 25
14. 27
15. 29
16. 31
17. 33
18. 35
19. 37
20. 39
21. 41
22. 43
23. 45
24. 47
25. 49
26. 51
27. 53
28. 55
29. 57
30. 59
31. 61
32. 63
33. 65

Select any term and look at the number across from it. Suppose
we look at term 9 and then across to 17. This means that if we add
all the odd numbers from 1 through l7, we will make the square of 9
or 9x9=81.
                                                                        46
"That's fine," you say, "but how do I keep all that in my head?
What if the man had been carrying 1,000,00l squares?

Look for a PATTERN or the makings of a PATTERN. Look at each
term carefully and at the odd number opposite. Yes, you would have
known the answer if the man had been carrying 1,000,001 squares!

Let's pick out a couple of terms at random with their odd
numbers opposite.

13. 25 and 25. 49

Got it now? What if I add "1" to each of the odd numbers so that
they are 26 and 50. Is that better?

We can see now that 13 is half of 26 and 25 is half of 50.

So how did you know that the man was completing the square of 33
when he was carrying 65 tiles?

You simply added 1 to 65 and got 66 and divided by 2 to make 33
and if you add all the odd numbers from 1 through 65 you will find
that they add to 1089 and when you take the square root of that you
will have 33!

Try that method with some of the terms listed earlier. Simply
add 1 to the odd number opposite and divide by two.

Oh, yes. If the man had been carrying 1,000,001 tiles (and he
must be carrying an odd number to complete a square if he is carrying
what he needs to complete a square each time), you would simply add 1
to 1,000,001 and get 1,000,002 and divide by 2 to get 500,001 so he
would be making the square of 500,001x500,001 for a rather large
john!

So, we have learned how to make squares by addition. I'm not
forgetting that we can make squares simply by multiplying a number
times itself.

But the principle of addition is important in making the other
geometrical figures we will be exploring at another date and I'm sure
that the ancients knew about addition long before they knew about
multiplication.

But let's not go down that path now. Let's stick with the task
at hand, studying the squares on the Square of Nine chart.


Chapter 4-The 45-Degree Line

We will now look again at the concept of the "variable of two"
or the gain of two and see if we can apply it to the Square of Nine
chart.
                                                                        47
In order to do that we need to define "45 degree lines" on the
chart.

When Gann spoke of the even squares being on a 45 degree line,
I, like my friend who had studied Gann longer than I had, and maybe
some like you, took him to mean the 135 degree line where the numbers
5, 17, 37, etc. are located since the even square numbers are next to
that line.

After all, the chart only shows four 45-degree lines unless you
want to count the four cardinal lines going up and down and across as
45-degree lines (which is the basis of what some call an octagon
chart and is another concept we will look at in future work).

In discussing the soybean market of the late 1940's and early
1950's and its application to the 1 through 33 chart, Gann mentions
the 45-degree line from 310 to 240. Another puzzle.

Could it mean that going around a square of the Square of Nine
chart meant a 45-degree angle? Again he mentions a 45-degree angle
and seems to be mentioning the number 45 on the chart when he
discusses the relationship between December, 1932 and January, 1948.
Still hazy.

It finally dawned on me. There are 45-degree angles all over the
place!

Let's use our "gain of two" knowledge to help establish that
fact. We will use the low cash price on beans of 44 and work toward
the high of 436.

As Gann said, the price of 44 is in the square of 7. The square
of 6 ends at 36 and the square of 7 at 49. So Gann says that 44 is in
the square of 7.

Looking back at the two lines we created earlier, the terms and
the odd numbers to make the squares, we see that after the square of
7 is made, we have to add 15 to make the next square and then 17,
etc.

So we will start with 44 and add the odd numbers to it, the odd
numbers that make the squares after the square of 7. Let us put the
results in two rows so they may be more readily understood. So with
you looking over my shoulder, let's do it.

44+15=59
59+17=76
76+19=95
95+21=116
116+23=139
139+25=164
164+27=191
191+29=220
220+31=251
                                                                        48
251+33=284
284+35=319
319+37=356
356+39=395
395+41=436

Observe the two rows of numbers and see where they fall on the
Square of Nine chart. The row 59, 95, etc. falls on a diagonal that
is parallel to the even square numbers.

The row 76, 116, etc. down to 436 runs on a parallel with the
odd square numbers.

Since the rows are parallel and the squares run on a 45 degree
angle then the row running parallel to it is also a 45-degree angle!

If we draw a square on a piece of paper and run a line
diagonally from one corner to another, the diagonal line forms a 45-
degree angle with the side of the square and any line running
parallel to that diagonal is also a 45-degree angle.

One easy way to tell that the rows are parallel is to compare
the distance from the numbers in one row to the numbers in the other.

We can see, even without looking at the chart that 44 is 5 less
than 49 (the square of 7) and 436 is 5 less than 441 (the square of
21).

Like I said above, there are 45-degree angles all over the
place, not just those that are marked as such. They not only run from
northeast to southwest in this case, but also run from southeast to
northwest.



Chapter 5-The Number 9 and the Squares

The number 9 has many interesting relationships between the
squares, triangles and other geometric figures as you will see as we
progress through this series. I suspect that is why Gann emphasized
the number so much. There is one relationship we can observe right
here.

We saw that 44 was in the square of 7 and that 436 was in the
square of 21 or 441. If we multiply 9 times 49 we get 441 and if you
count seven squares down from 44 you will end up at 436 like this:

44
76-1
116-2
164-3
220-4
284-5
356-6
                                                                        49
436-7

Coincidence? Maybe. But you have seen many other coincidences in
this work already. I'm not saying that low to high can be figured in
the same way each time, but it is another "path to explore" at a
later date.

As I showed above when we multiply 9 times an odd square such as
49 and count down its square root of 7 we arrive at the answer of
9x49. Let's look at some others. Let's multiply 9 times 25. 25 is
5x5. So if we count 5 odd squares down we will arrive at the answer:

25 (5x5)
49 (7x7)-1
81 (9x9)-2
121 (11x11)-3
169 (13x13)-4
225 (15x15)-5-The answer. 9x25 is 225.

Now you try one. Try 9 times 121 and count down 11 squares to
the answer.

Note: In checking PATTERN it is often easy enough just to start
from the lowest number on the ladder, usually 1. 1 is 1x1 and we only
have to count down one odd square to get the answer. 9x1 is 9! And 9
is the answer. If it works at the bottom rung chances are it will
work any where up from there. You don't have to go up in the hundreds
to start looking for your PATTERN.

"What about the even squares?" you ask.

They work the same way:

4 (2x2)
16 (4x4)-1
36 (6x6)-2. Since 2 is the square root of 4 we have to count
down only two even squares to get the answer. 9x4 is 36.

Try a few. Go ahead. It only takes a few seconds.

(There are some interesting things you can do with this concept
and have the answer without even looking at the chart. For example
you can multiply 44 times 9 and then you can do this to get to
436...I'll let you supply the answer. It works every time. After all
why should I have all the fun.)



Chapter 6-Adding and Multipl ying Squares

A square times a square is always a square, but the addition of
one square to another does not always make a square.

When we multiplied 9 (3x3) times one of the squares above, we
                                                                        50
always came up with a square. We saw that 9 times 25 (5x5) is 225 or
the square of 15.

Why is a square times a square always a square?

We can put down their square roots and find out why.

Above we saw that 9 times 25 is 225 or the square of 15.

We can say 9x25=225 or

We can put down their square roots and multiply them:

3x3x5x5=225

Or we can rearrange the numbers to read:

3x5x3x5=225 or

(15)x(15)=225.

That works for any squares we want to multiply:

25x49=1225 or

5x5x7x7=1225 or

5x7x5x7=1225 or

(35)x(35)=1225.

All we have to remember is to use the square roots of each
square.

What is 49 times 81?

Ans: 63 squared or the square root of 49 times the square root
of 81 squared.

This book is about squares, but the same method also works for
cubes and all the other powers of numbers.

The cube of 9 times the cube of 4 is:

9x9x9 or 729 times 4x4x4 or 64 which is

729x64=46656

Since the cube root of the cube of 9 is 9 and the cube root of
the cube of 4 is 4 we can multiply 9x4 and cube it:

36x36x36=46656

Try that with some fourth, fifth and sixth powers of numbers.
If only the "adding" of squares was so easy! Then the Gann
                                                                       51
material might not be so difficult. But that is an area we must
explore so get on your backpack and let's get started.

Let's begin by adding the square of 6 or 36 to the square of 7
or 49. When I use the term "square of" I mean it in the same sense
that Gann did. Square of 7 means seven squared or the second power of
7.

So, when we add 36 to 49 we get 85, which is not a natural
square. As I said earlier we can often check our PATTERN by starting
at the bottom of the ladder. Since the square of 1 is 1 and the
square of 2 is 4, they add to 5 which is not a natural square and
right away we know that adding squares do not always make another
square.

That does not necessarily mean that other squares cannot be
added to obtain squares.

By trial and error we can check some of the squares. We find
that the square of l2 and the square of 5 will add to another square
when we add 144 to 25 and get 169 or the square of 13 (a number that
Gann says is important for more reasons than just the way it is on
the hexagon chart.)

One nice thing about finding squares that add to other squares
is that you can expand the group by using their multiples.

In the example above we used 12 and 5. We can multiply both
numbers by 2 and get 24 and 10. Squaring those two and adding we get:

576+100=676 which is the square of 26 and 26 is 2 times 13.

Multiply 12 times 3 to get 36 and 5 times 3 to get 15 and the
total of their squares will be the square of 39 or 3 times 13
squared.

This can all be seen from that "principle" which the Masons call
"secret." But this in not the place to discuss that "secret" now. We
will look at that when we look at the connections between Masonry and
Gann's work.

There is a way of knowing which squares will add to squares and
which will not. This is not one of my "discoveries" but something I
found in a book during my long studies. More on that later.



Chapter 7-Range as a Difference in Squares

Gann mentions and shows how to "square" the range, which is not
really a square at all.

Other writers have zeroed in on this so there is no need to go
into that if you have read the material closely.
                                                                        52
But, there is another relationship between the range and the
squares which I discovered.

And that is the range as "the difference in squares."

First, we will look at the concept of the difference in squares
and then we will look at least at one example in the Gann material
where we can see this concept in action.

If we want to find the difference in squares we could simply
square two numbers and subtract the smaller answer from the larger in
the following manner:

21x21=441
14x14=196
The difference is 245

Another way to do it, which is easier in dealing with very large
numbers, is this:

Subtract the smaller square root from the larger one and then
add the smaller square root to the larger one and multiply the
answers:

21-14=7
21+14=35 and 7x35=245

The difference in the square of 8 and the square of 9 is (9-
8)x(9+8) or 17 as we saw when we were building the squares with the
odd numbers.

The difference in the square of 63 and 67 would be 4x130 or 520.
Check it out! Much easier than (67x67)-(63x63)! Another little
something I discovered on my own. This makes it easy to do this in
your head.

The difference in the square of 12 and the square of 13? 1x25 as
we have already seen.

To recap, simply take the square roots of the two squares,
subtract them and add them, then take your answers and multiply and
you will have the difference of the squares.

A table of the difference of the squares can be made up as
follows:
            x     1     2     3     4     5    6        7    8     9    10   11    12
            1     x     3     8     15    24   35       48   63    80   99   120   143
            2     x     x     5     12    21   32       45   60    77   96   117   140
            3     x     x     x     7     16   27       40   55    72   91   112   135
            4     x     x     x     x     9    20       33   48    65   84   105   128
            5     x     x     x     x     x    11       24   39    56   75   96    119
            6     x     x     x     x     x    x        13   28    45   64   85    108

                                                                                         53
            7     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     15     32   51   72   95
            8     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      17   36   57   80
            9     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x    19   40   63
            10    x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x    x    21   44
            11    x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x    x    x    23
            12    x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x    x    x    x

Here, I have shown just the first 12 squares, but the chart can
be extended as far as you like.

You can see how the odd numbers run on a diagonal going from top
left to bottom right.

They show the difference in the successive squares. Look down
the list of numbers at the left to the number 4 and then go over to
the intersection of that row with column 5 and you will see the
number 9. So the difference in 4x4 (16) and 5x5 (25) is 9.

Staying on the same row (4) and going on to column 7 we see that
the difference is 33. This is made by adding the odd numbers at the
bottom of columns 5, 6 and 7, which are 9, 11 and 13.

So, you can figure the differences in the same way and extend
this chart as far as you want to go.

Now let's take a look at least at one place where I said I found
the range to be a difference in squares.

Let's look back at the cash low of beans at 44 cents and the
high of the May contract in 1948 at 436 and we wee that the range was
392.

If we subtract 7 (the square root of 49) from 21 (the square
root of 441 we get 14 and when we multiply 14 times (21+7) or 28 we
get 392, the difference between the square of 7 and the square of 21.

(Note: This particular range can also be expressed as a double
square. You can find double squares simply by multiplying a number
times it double, in this case 14x28 which is 2(14x14).)

(Also note: 28 was one of the numbers involved in the "Great
Cycle" discussed in Book II of this series.)

(And remember also that the time from the 1948 high to the
February, 1949 low was 56 weeks and 56 is 2x28 as shown in Book I of
this series, "The Cycle of Mars." There we subtracted 56 seven times
from the high and were left with 44!)

There might be many other ranges in the Gann material that are
differences in squares, but that is a path I have not gone down as
yet.

But in keeping with my promise to you to quote chapter and verse

                                                                                       54
on the numbers in the Gann material, let's look at his cotton chart
of the 1930's and 1940's, the monthly one.

Cotton made bottom on June 9, 1932. (Note Robert Gordon's birth
and nickname. More about that in my discussion of "The Tunnel Thru
the Air.")

The bottom was made at 515. Gann laid out the chart on a 20-
point per month basis. The top on this chart comes out at 172 months
so 20x172=3440.

The price did not quite make that level but that is the price
based on the monthly increments on the 45-degree line.

The square of 57 ends at 57x57 or 3249. Subtracting that from
3440 or 3440-3249 leaves 191 in the next square.

Now subtract 191 from 515 and see what you have. That's right,
you arrived at 324 or the square of 18 and remember what Gann said
about a change in cycles here with a 45-degree angle coming down.

We can now prove that the range equals a difference in squares:

3440-515=2925=THE RANGE
57x57=5249
18x18=324
3249-324=2925=The difference in the square of 57 and the square
of 18.

Or doing it the easy way. 57-l8=39 and 57+l8=75 and 39x75=2925.

Therefore the RANGE equals the difference of two squares!

There is another interesting twist here. Let's add the bottom to
the top. 3440+515. We get 3955. Add 14 and take the square root. It
is 63. Add 14 to 515 to get 529. Take the square root and we find it
is 23.

Since both numbers are within 14 of an odd square then both
numbers are on a 45-degree line with each other, just as 44 and 436
in the case of soybeans were on a 45-degree line from each other.
Extend the Square of 33 chart on out and you will find this to be
correct.

Coincidental? Maybe. But like I noted in Book III, "The Book
With No Name," the coincidences in Books I, II, III and now Book IV,
are certainly piling up.



Chapter 8-The Other Leg of the "X"

We have seen how the odd squares run along the 315 degree angle

                                                                       55
on the Square of Nine chart and how the even squares run next to the
135 degree line forming a close but not exact diagonal like this:


/
(That's a pretty small diagonal, but the only one I can make
with this screen so just look at your Square of Nine Chart to get the
idea.)

I noted how the even squares are just a little off that line,
but for the sake of this illustration we will say that both the even
and odd squares form one leg of an "X".

But that other leg running like this:


\
and running from northwest to southeast contains numbers that
are closely related to the squares.

Recall that we used the odd numbers added in order to form a
PATTERN. That PATTERN was the natural squares in order.

Now just for fun let's do the same thing with the "even" numbers
in order to see if we can form another kind of PATTERN.

In one row we will list the even numbers in order and in the
other we will keep a running total:

22
46
6 12
8 20
10 30
12 42
14 56
16 72
18 90
20 110
22 132
24 156
26 182
28 210
30 240
32 272
34 306
36 342

Let's look at the numbers in the right hand column and see if we
can find a PATTERN. I noted earlier that although we would be using
addition quite a bit we would not forget multiplication so let's look
at the first two numbers and think of multiplication.

                                                                        56
If we think of the number 2 and think of multiplication and
think of the answer which is also 2, there is really only one
conclusion.

1x2=2

The number 6 can be made by multiplication in two ways:

1x6 and 2x3. Any PATTERN here?

Let's try another one.

The number 12 can be made in three ways:

1x12, 2x6 and 3x4.

Any PATTERN yet? Let's check our numbers from the three
different series:

1x2, 1x6, 1x12. There is certainly a PATTERN here as each is
multiplied by 1, but doesn't tell us much of anything. We can see
that 2 times 6 is 12, or the third number, but carrying out that
PATTERN would have us multiply 6x12 and that certainly does not give
us the next number which is 20 so we will drop that PATTERN here and
now.

Let's take another look at the multiples.

1x2, 2x3, 2x6 and the next number would be 2x10 to make 20.
Still not much. So with some elimination by trial and error we are
now down to:

1x2, 2x3, 3x4. A PATTERN. What do you think?

We could make 20 by 1x20, 2x10 or 4x5. Select one of these,
place it with the others and see if you can make a PATTERN.

The 1x20 is a PATTERN with the first, 1x2. But not with the
others. 2x10 makes a PATTERN with 2x3, but not the other two.

4x5 doesn't seem to make a PATTERN with anything. About time to
lay this down and move on to something else.

Whoa! Wait a minute. Let's put it down with the others and have
a look at it!

1x2, 2x3, 3x4, 4x5.

Yes, there is a PATTERN! In each case we have used the last
number of each pair of numbers as the first number in the next pair
and multiplied it by its following number:

1x2=2
2x3=6, we took the 2 from above and multiplied by the number
following.
                                                                       57
3x4=12, we took the three from above and multiplied it times the
number following.

With that reasoning we would have to say then that the next
number in the PATTERN would have to be:

4x5=20

And checking our theory with the next it would be:

5x6=30

and the next

6x7=42

PATTERN MADE!!!!

Now, check the numbers 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, etc. and see how
they form the other leg of the "X" on the Square of Nine chart. The
one that goes like this:


\
Let's look at a portion of the Square of Nine Chart to get the idea.


                          57    58   59    60    61      62   63   64   65
                          56    31   32    33    34      35   36   37   66
                          55    30   13    14    15      16   17   38   67
                          54    29   12     3     4      5    18   39   68
                          53    28   11     2     1      6    19   40   69
                          52    27   10     9     8      7    20   41   70
                          51    26   25    24    23      22   21   42   71
                          50    49   48    47    46      45   44   43   72
                          81    80   79    78    77      76   75   74   73
As you can see the squares are in yellow. The other numbers are in blue.

And the diagonals are not exact, but you get the idea.

"Okay," you say. "Those PATTERN are very nice and the numbers
make a nice PATTERN forming the other leg of the "X" on the Square of
Nine chart. But this is a discussion on squares. What do these
numbers have to do with squares?"

Fair question. And here is the answer. You have now discovered
something that Gann hints at, but never quite discusses. You have
discovered how to make:

THE GEOMETRIC MEAN!


                                                                             58
Gann speaks of the arithmetic mean or half-way point. The others
you more or less have to pick out for yourself.

The ancients recognized 10 "means" and that might be why they
thought the number 10 was so important. It could also be what is
represented by the 10 of the tetraxes of Pythagorus.

But we will be looking at only three of those means, the
arithmetic, the geometric and the harmonic.

First, let's define the word "mean." Generally it signifies a
middle term in a group of three terms that has a certain mathematical
relationship between the first and last term or ties them together.

Gann told us about the "arithmetic mean" or half-way point.

Let's find the half-way point between 6 and 12. Most writers,
myself included until I finally started doing it Gann's way, would
take the 12 and subtract the 6 for an answer of 6. We would then
divide by 2 to get 3 and add that to 6 to get 9.

Gann did it the easy way. I have learned to do the same and you
should too. You simply add the two terms, 6+12, to get 18 and then
divide by 2 to get 9.

Gann found his half-way point from the low of 44 to the high of
436 in soybeans by adding 44 to 436 and dividing by 2 to get 240.

Of course just looking at 6 and 12 we would have had the answer
in our head without doing any calculations, but with very large
numbers the latter method is a lot easier, adding 1089 and 1225 for
instance and dividing by two to get the arithmetic mean or half-way
point.

Putting down the three terms, 6, 9, 12 gives us 9 as the
"arithmetic" mean, the half-way point between the two numbers. 9 is 3
more than 6 and 3 less than 12.

Another way to put it is to think of the 3 as an "adder." Add 3
to 6 to get 9 and then add 3 to 9 to get 12 and 9 will be the
"arithmetic" mean. Try that with different numbers and different
adders.

With the geometric mean, the middle number is arrived at by
multiplying the first number by a multiplier and using the same
multiplier to multiply the middle number and get the third number.
Starting at 6 like above and using 3 as a "multiplier" instead
of an "adder" we would get 18 and then multiplying 18 by 3 we would
get 54 so we would have the series:

6, 18, 54 and 18 would be the "geometric" mean.

One way to check a series to find if it is geometric is to do
this:

                                                                        59
Multiply the two end terms, in this case 6 and 54.

6x54=324

The answer, 324, will be the square of the middle term. Take the
square root of 324 and we will have 18. Try that with some other
beginning number and some other multiplier to prove it to yourself.

The "multiplier" does not have to be a natural number. That
statement leads us back to your question about the squares.

Let's look at the number 16, the square of 4, and multiply it
times an unnatural number, 1-1/4 or 1.25

16x1.25=20

and multiply our answer again by 1.25

20x1.25=25

20 is the "geometric" mean between the square of 4 (16) and the
square of 5 (25).

We can now go from 25, the square of 5, to 36, the square of 6:

25x1-1/5=30
30x1-1/5=36

30 is the "geometric" mean between 25 and 36.

Did you notice a PATTERN here?

Going from the square of 16 to the geometric mean at 20 to the
square of 25 we used a multiplier which has a fraction of 1/4 and
going from 25 to 30 to 36 we used a multiplier which has a fraction
of 1/5.

Now guess what the fraction of the multiplier would be if we
went from 36 to 49 and found the geometric mean between the two.

If you said 1/6 you would be right because you saw the PATTERN
1/4, 1/5. Let's check to see if we are right:

36x1-1/6=42
42x1-1/6=49

and 42 is the "geometric" mean between the square of 6 and the
square of 7.

And you will also notice that 4 is the square root of 16, 5 the
square root of 25 and 6 is the square root of 36.

What if we wanted to get the geometric mean between 100 and 121,
the squares of 10 and 11. The square root of 100 is 10 so we would
say:
                                                                      60
100x1-1/10=110 (as in "The Tunnel Thru the Air")
110x1-1/10=121

But there is a simpler way and maybe you have seen that already.

We can simply take the square roots of each number and multiply
them.

For example the square root of 16 is 4 and the square root of 25
is 5 and 4x5=20, the geometric mean between the squares!

Now look back at the two rows of figures we created earlier and
you will note that when we add the "even" numbers in order we form
the geometric means of the squares in order.

1x2=2, the geometric mean between the square of 1 and the square
of 2.

2x3=6, the geometric mean between the square of 2 and the square
of 3, etc.

We can now check to see if we are right by multiplying the
squares and taking the square root to get the mean. For example:

16, 20, 25

16x25=400
20x20=400

and we are right.

The row of numbers, 1x2, 2x3, 3x4, etc. give us the geometric
means between the squares in order. But the square root method will
give us the geometric mean between "any" two squares where they be
"successive" squares are not.

To get the geometric mean between 49 and 81 we use the square
root of 49 which is 7 and the square root of 81 which is 9 and simply
multiply them:

7x9=63

If we want to know the multiplier, simply divide 7 into 9 which
is 1-2/7.

49x1-2/7=63
63x1-2/7=81

And 49 times 81 equals 63x63. Use your calculator to prove it.
Then pick out a couple of non-successive squares, give it a try and
prove your answer.




                                                                        61
Chapter 9-More 45-Degree Angles

We have seen that by using the square roots of any two squares
we can make the "geometric" mean of the two squares.

We have already seen that the "geometric" means of the
successive squares form a leg of the "X" of the Square of Nine chart.

Do the last two paragraphs suggest anything to you along the
lines of "exploration?"

How about this. Can we find a PATTERN of "geometric" means that
are not the geometric means of successive squares?

The geometric means of the "successive" squares were formed by
simply:

1x2=3
2x3=6
3x4=12
4x5=20, etc.

What if we used only the odd numbers so that we get:

1X3
3X5
5X7. Want to check that out before you go any farther?

Here's the work out:

1x3=3
3x5=15
5x7=35
7x9=63
9x11=99 etc.

Do you see the PATTERN now? Check it out on the Square of Nine
chart.

Look at the answers above. Each one is 1 less than the even
squares in order. 3 is 1 less than 4 (2x2), 15 is one less than 16
(4x4), 35 is 1 less than 36 (6x6), etc.

If you checked them out you found that they run on a 45-degree
line parallel to the line which contains the even squares.

Does that suggest another path to explore?

Let's try the same method using the even numbers in order to
multiply:

2x4=8
4x6=24

                                                                        62
6x8=48
8x10=80
10x12=120

PATTERN?

Yes, you were a little quick with the answers that time. All the
answers (the geometric means between the even squares in order) are 1
less than the odd squares in order and the numbers run on a 45-degree
line parallel to the line which contains the odd squares.

In the two examples above we have used numbers that are 2 units
apart, 1x3, 3x5, 2x4, 4x6, etc.

Now try some that are more than two units apart to see if you
can discover some other geometric means which are on other 45-degree
lines.

Go ahead! I'm going to rest awhile!

How did you do?

Let's have a look at your work.

Since I showed you how to do those using numbers 2 units apart
you probably picked up on that and tried those that are 3 units
apart. Let's have a look at them.

First we will start the count from the number 1.

1x4=4
4x7=28
7x10=70
10x13=130
13x16=208
16x19=304
19x22=418
22x25=550
25x28=700

There are nine workouts. If we don't have a PATTERN after nine
terms we will probably not get one. Let's check our answers on the
Square of Nine chart. Yes, we can see that 28, 130, 304 and 550 run
on a 45-degree line by skipping over two terms each time.

Going the other way we can see that 70, 208, 418 and 700 run on
a 45-degree angle by skipping over two terms each time.

Skipping "two terms." Gann's "variation of two" again.

Using the same method again we will begin with the number 2 and
use numbers that are three units apart:

2x5=10
5x8=40
                                                                        63
8x11=88
11x14=154
14x17=238
17x20=340
20x23=460
23x26=598
26x29=754

Looking at the Square of Nine chart we see that 10, 88 and 238,
etc. run on a 45-degree angle, also skipping two terms at a time.
Checking 40, 154, 340, we see the same PATTERN going the other way.

Now let's use some numbers which are 4 units apart starting with
1.

1x5=5
5x9=45
9x13=117
13x17=221
17x21=357
21x25=525
25x29=725
29x33=957
33x37=1221

I'll let you check them on the Square of Nine chart. After all
why should I have all the fun!

Note: In some cases the first number does not always fall into
the PATTERN. One of the few times you cannot check your work with the
bottom of the ladder.

Now that I have showed you the idea I will let you work out the
numbers that are four units apart starting from 2.

Then try the same method using numbers that are 5 units apart, 6
units, etc.

REMEMBER-The numbers being found are the "geometric" means
between the squares.

The 221 above is the geometric mean between 13x13 and l7x17 in
the series:

169, 221, 289

It can be checked by:

169x289 and then taking the square root which will give you 221.

The multiplier can be found by diving 13 into l7 which is 1-4/13

169x1-4/13=221
221x1-4/13=289

                                                                        64
And therefore 221 is the geometric mean between the squares of
13 and 17.

Those of you who read Book I, "The Cycle of Mars," might recall
that the time from the January l948 high to the February l949 low was
56 weeks. Also Gann said in his writeup of the Square of 144 to place
it on 132. Both numbers are geometric means. I'll leave it up to you
as good practice to figure out their squares.

We will deal with the geometric means of cubes and other figures
in their proper place and where they are found in the Gann material.



Chapter 10-Other Properties of Squares

Here is another interesting property of squares.

Let's put down three numbers in a row at random:

8, 9, 10

If we multiply the two end terms and add 1 we will always have
the square of the middle term:

(8x10)+1=81 (9x9)

Try one.

32, 33, 34 you say.

(32x34)+1=1089 (33x33)

Let's take our original:

8, 9, 10

and decrease the first term by 1 to 7 and increase the last term
by 1 to 11 so that we have:

7, 9, 11

and multiplying

7x11=77

We can see that 77 from 81 leaves 4 and that is the difference
between 7 and 11. Looks like a PATTERN. But going back to 8, 9, 10 we
see that 8 from 10 is 2 and 2 plus 8x10 is 82, not 81, so no PATTERN.

Let's do another one decreasing the first term again by 1 from 7
to 6 and increasing the last term by 1 from 11 to 12 so that we have
6, 9, 12.

                                                                        65
6x12=72 and now we are 9 units away from 81 and 6 from 12 is 6
so we know that is not the way to go. So let's see if we can find the
PATTERN by checking our differences.

81-(8x10)=1
81-(7x11)=4
81-(6x12)=9

I think we know enough about squares now to see that the
differences are squares, the squares of 1, 2 and 3.

Observe the multipliers again. See a PATTERN?

If we subtract the numbers of the multipliers in each case and
divide by two and then square the answer we will be on the right
track.

(10-8) divided by 2 is 1. We square it and get 1.

(11-7) divided by 2 is 2. We square it and get 4.
(12-6) divided by 2 is 3. We square it and get 9.

So when we multiplied 8x10 and added 1 we were really adding the
square of 1. I know what you are thinking. "Why quibble.?"

The square of 1 is 1 and 1 is 1. True, But we must often think
of 1 as a square, not merely the number 1, when we look at the single
digit system, how the squares work in the circle and the formation of
other geometric figures in other books in this series so we might as
well establish that fact here.

Thinking of 1 as only 1 and not a square is why a number of
commentators on the Square of Nine chart start from a wrong premise.

Another approach we could have used instead of taking the
difference of the multipliers and then dividing by 2 is simply to
have used the distance between the end terms and the middle. The
distance from 8 to 9 is 1, the distance from 7 to 9 is 2 and the
distance from 6 to 9 is 3.

So we can take any number, add and subtract any equal amount,
multiply those two answers, square half of their difference and add
to the answer to find the square of the original number.

I know that's a mouth full but let's look at another example.
Take the number 35, subtract 5 to get 30, add 5 to get 40. Multiply
30 times 40 to get 1200. Square 5 to get 25. Add 25 to 1200 to get
1225 and we have the square of 35. It works everytime.

That's what I did in Book I-"The Cycle of Mars" in my discussion
of the numbers 56 and 88. I multiplied them and added the square of
half of their difference or 16x16 to arrive at the square of 72,
Gann's inner square.

There is another interesting relationship between three
                                                                        66
successive numbers and the squares.

Remember that we make squares by adding the odd numbers in
order. When you add any two successive odd numbers the answer is
always divisible by 4. If we add 21 and 23 we get 44 which can be
divided by 4 to make 11.

Therefore when we multiply any number by 4 the answer is the sum
of two successive odd numbers which we use to make the squares.

What does that suggest to you as a relationship between three
successive numbers?

If we multiply the middle number by four and add it to the
square of the first number we will have the square of the last.

In the above example we can use the numbers 10, 11, 12. Multiply
11 by 4 and we get 44. Add 44 to 10x10 or 100 and we get 144 or the
square of 12. On the odd number basis we looked at on building the
squares we would have added 21 to the square of 10 to get the square
of 11 and then added 23 to 121 to get 144 or the square of 12.

Try it on a few numbers.

Then look at the Square of Nine chart and follow it on the
angles. For example start at 25 and then count "6" units to the next
angle and 6 to the next etc. until you reach 49 or the square of 7.

The next time around from 7x7 to get on the angles would require
"8" units. There is that old reliable "variable of two" again. So
(7x7)+4x8=9x9.



Chapter 11-How To Make the "Unnatural" Squares

We have seen how the natural squares are made in order simply by
adding the odd natural numbers in order.

But when we look at the Gann material there are many numbers
that are not natural numbers let along natural squares.

When I started thinking about the unnatural squares, those that
have a fraction, decimal, etc., I knew that they could be made by
multiplication, 67.5x67.5 and 5.625x5.625 etc., but I wondered if
they could be made by addition.

That is, could we build squares that always ended with a side
that had a fraction like .5.

It took me two days to "discover" it. I don't mean I spent a
full two days. I care for elderly parents so the work I give to Gann
in recent years is 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there, etc.

                                                                       67
It might have taken me a little less time, but I came at the
problem from a different viewpoint instead of attacking it headon.

If you want to quit this for a few minutes and give it a shot go
ahead and I'll rest awhile.

Did you get it?

Let's have a look. Let's make squares in order that will have .5
as the fractional part of the sides so that we have squares that are:

.5x.5
1.5x1.5
2.5x2.5
3.5x3.5 etc.

Give it another try.

Instead of going around it from another direction which I will
explain in the book on the other figures, let's attack it head on.

Since each time we will be adding something to get the next
square, as the odd numbers are added to get the natural squares,
let's see what has to be added in the examples above.

It would seem possible just to add 1 to go from .5x.5 to
1.5x1.5, but such is not the case. Remember, we are not adding
numbers to make the "side" or the square root of the square, but the
square itself. In other words we are looking for something to add to
.5x.5 so that when we take the square root we will have 1.5.

Let's look at it.

.5x.5=.25
1.5x1.5=2.25
2.5x2.5=6.25
3.5x3.5=12.25

A PATTERN?

To .25 we had to add 2 to get 2.25
To 2.25 we had to add 4 to get 6.25
To 6.25 we had to add 6 to get 12.25

Can you now guess what would have to be added to arrive at the
square 4.5x4.5.

If you said 8 you are correct. You saw the PATTERN 2, 4, 6 and
the next logical step would be to add 8.

So let's add 8 to 12.25 and take the square root. Yes, the
square root of 20.25 is 4.5. Add 10 and take the square root and you
will have 5.5, etc.

Let's look at another, this time using 1/4 or .25 as the
                                                                        68
fraction for our sides so that we will build the squares with sides
of .25, 1.25, 2.25, 3.25 etc.

.25x.25=.0625
1.25x1.25=1.5625
2.25x2.25=5.0625
3.25x3.25=10.5625

Subtracting the answers one from the other we can see that:

.0625 plus 1.5=1.5625 or 1.25x1.25
1.5625 plus 3.5=5.0625 or 2.25x2.25
5.0625 plus 5.5=10.5625 or 3.25x3.25

Now what would we add to get the next square, 4.25x4.25.?

Look for the PATTERN.

You are right if you said 7.5. You saw that the fraction .5 was
the same with the natural numbers being 1, 3, 5.

We can check that by adding 7.5 to 10.5625 to get 18.0625 and
taking the square root we get 4.25.

Let's try another one, this time we will use .75 as the fraction
of each of our squares in order:

.75x.75=.5625
1.75x1.75=3.0625
2.75x2.75=7.5625
3.75x3.75=14.0625

Subtracting the answers one from the other in order we find that
their differences are:

2.5
4.5
6.5

The fraction is the same and the natural numbers are the even
numbers in order.

In each case we have multiplied the square roots of the squares
and then subtracted the results from each other to see what it would
take to make the next square by addition.

But is there an easier way of knowing what numbers to add
without going through all that? Like I said before it took me about
two days because I was coming at it from a different direction. But
when the answer came, it was obvious.

Before looking at the answer below, go back and study the
examples and then try to make the squares using .618 as the fraction
for the sides in order so that you have squares of .618x.618,
l.618x1.618, 2.618x2.618 etc. (Remember to make them by addition not
                                                                       69
by multiplication).

Remember! PATTERN!

If you said from the square of .6l8 add 2.236, 4.236, 6.236,
etc. then you are correct. If you did not, go back and study again
before looking at the answer below.

To make the unnatural squares in order so that the sides have
the same fraction or decimal point simply:

TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE SQUARE, DOUBLE IT AND ADD 1.

In the example above we would have taken .618, the square root
of .618x.618, and doubled it to get 1.236 and added 1 to get 2.236.
Since the natural number part of our answer is 2 then we would use
4.236 for the next adder, 6.236 for the next adder, 8.236 for the
next, etc.

If we wanted to use .38 as the decimal in our sides we would
double .38 to get .76 and add 1 to get 1.76. Since the natural part
of our number is 1 then we would use the odd numbers in order with
the .76 for our adders, 1.76, 3.76, 5.76, etc. That old "variable of
two" again.

Now go back and check the work we did with .5, .25 and .75 and
you will have the idea.

I noted earlier that the answer should have been obvious.

For simplicity sake let's go back to our natural squares.

Say we had a square of 4x4 or 16 and we wanted to add to that to
get a square of 5x5 or 25.

Like the man building the john we could place four tiles on the
top of our 4x4 and then place 4 tiles along the right hand side.
There would be an empty space at the top-right corner where we would
have to place another tile. So we place 4 and 4 or 2x4 and then add 1
for a total of 9 . And 9 plus 16 equals 25.

Carrying it further we could then place 5 tiles on top of the
5x5 and 5 on the right hand side and place 1 in the top corner for a
total of 11 which would then make the square a 6x6.

In each case we used the square root of the square, doubled it
and added 1.

The square root of 16 is 4. Two times 4 is 8. Add 1 and we get
9. 9 plus 16 is 25. Then the square root of 25 is 5 and 2x5 is 10.
Add 1 to get 11 and 11 plus 25 is 36 or 6x6.

The square of 2.618 is 6.853924.

Add (2x2.618)+1 or 6.236 and we get 13.089924. We take the
                                                                        70
square root of 13.089924 and we get 3.618.

It works every time!


Chapter 12-Regular Squares and the Square of Nine Chart

Now we will look at regular squares and the Square of Nine
chart.

To build the Square of Nine chart Gann began with 1 in the
center and then put the squares around it.

The man laying tiles in the john would have built his squares in
a different way, one in which we would probably build one. We would
start at the 90-degree corner of a wall and build them up to the top
and to the right in the same way we built them in our example and
number them so that the number of the squares would run along the
bottom line.

Let's do that now:


     197   198   199    200   201   202    203   204   205   206   207   208   209   210   211
     170   171   172    173   174   175    176   177   178   179   180   181   182   183   212
     145   146   147    148   149   150    151   152   153   154   155   156   157   184   213
     122   123   124    125   126   127    128   129   130   131   132   133   158   185   214
     101   102   103    104   105   106    107   108   109   110   111   134   159   186   215
     82    83    84     85    86    87     88    89    90    91    112   135   160   187   216
     65    66    67     68    69    70     71    72    73    92    113   136   161   188   217
     50    51    52     53    54    55     56    57    74    93    114   137   162   189   218
     37    38    39     40    41    42     43    58    75    94    115   138   163   190   219
     26    27    28     29    30    31     44    59    76    95    116   139   164   191   220
     17    18    19     20    21    32     45    60    77    96    117   140   165   192   221
     10    11    12     13    22    33     46    61    78    97    118   141   166   193   222
     5     6     7      14    23    34     47    62    79    98    119   142   167   194   223
     2     3     8      15    24    35     48    63    80    99    120   143   168   195   224
     1     4     9      16    25    36     49    64    81    100   121   144   169   196   225


Now we can see an interesting relationship between the regular
squares and the Square of Nine chart.

Let's start with the number 4 and look at the numbers on the 45-
degree line going from bottom left to top right or as some would say
from the southwest to the northeast.

Those numbers are 4, 8, 14, 22, 32, etc.

First I must ask you to study that group of numbers to see if
you can make a PATTERN. Hint: Look at the differences in numbers.

                                                                                                 71
Did you get it?

Let's look at them.

The difference in 4 and 8 is 4
The difference in 8 and 14 is 6
The difference in 14 and 22 is 8
The difference in 22 and 32 is 10

Now without even looking at the chart do you know what the next
number on that 45-degree angle will be?

If you said 44 you would be correct.

Here again you saw that the "variable of 2" or the gain of two
was at work again. The differences in our example were 4, 6, 8, 10
and the next difference would be 12 and 32 plus 12 is 44. And the
next number would be 44 plus 14 or 58.

Now let's look at the numbers running up on the 45-degree line
parallel with those on the line of 4 that begin at 9.

9, 15, 23, 33

Can you see the PATTERN here without the hint? What would be the
next number on the line?

That's right. It's 45.

The difference in 9 and 15 is 6
The difference in 15 and 23 is 8
The difference in 23 and 33 is 10

The next difference would be 12 and 33 plus 12 is 45. That old
"variable of two" again. Now do a couple for yourself. Try 16, 25 and
36.

Now go to 1, 2, 5 and 10 and check them on the 45-degree angle.
Going up from 2 on the diagonal you will notice that each number is the geometric
mean between successive squares.
I noted above that there is an interesting relationship between
the usual square and the Square of Nine chart so let's get to it.

Look at the 45 degree angle again that contains the numbers 4,
8, 14, 22, 32.

Now let's multiply 4x8 and get 32. Look at the location of each
of those three numbers, 4, 8 and 32 on the usual square. They are on
the same 45-degree angle. You will find that when you multiply any
two numbers on a 45-degree angle, the answer will also be on the same
angle. Take the 5 numbers above and use any two to multiply and then
extend the series on out and you will find the answer.

Now try it with some of the numbers on the other 45-degree
                                                                                    72
angles.

Let's look at the Square of Nine chart. Locate 4, 8 and 32.
Notice anything?

We find that 4 and 32 are on a 45-degree angle and that 32 is 2
units away on that angle. If we go the 90-degree route we can go up
two units to 34 and the over two units to 32.

Let's try another, multiplying 8 times 14 to get 112. Locate 8,
14 and 112 on the Square of Nine chart. Notice anything?

We find that 8 and 112 are on a 45-degree angle and that 112 is
4 units away from 8 or if we take the 90 degree route we can do down
four units to 116 and then four units over to 112.

PATTERN?

In both examples above the answer is on the 45-degree angle with
the smaller number.

4x8=32 and 4 and 32 are on the 45-degree angle. 8x14 is 112 and
8 and 112 are on the 45-degree angle.

The second part of the PATTERN is that the distance on the 45-
degree angle from the small number to the answer is one-half the
small number. The distance between 4 and 32 is half of 4 or two
units. The distance between 8 and 112 is 4 units or one-half of
eight. And when we go the 90 degree route the distance is the small
number itself.

Now try 14 and 22 for yourself.

Before you multiply to get the answer try to find the answer on
the Square of Nine chart.

Let's try some from the 9 row on the regular square. We multiply
9 times 15 and get 135. Check those three numbers on the Square of
Nine chart. Then check 15 times 23.

Move over to the other side of the regular square and check 5
times 11 and 11 times 19.

PATTERN?

Yes, we have a PATTERN, but not like the one with the other
numbers.

You might have noticed that when we were doing 4, 8, 14 and 16,
24, etc. we were using even numbers and now with 9, 15 and 5, 11,
etc. we are using odd numbers.

When we use 9 and 15 and 5 and 11, the answer is found on the
45-degree lines running from the larger number. With the even numbers
the answer ran on the same 45-degree line as the smaller number.
                                                                        73
With the even numbers the answer was half the distance of the
smaller number. If the small number was four then the distance was
two.

It takes a little while to find the PATTERN with the odd
numbers. Give it a try before looking below.

With 9 and 15 the distance is four. With 11 and 19 the distance
is five. Got it now?

The distance is half of one less than the smaller number. 9
minus 1 is 8 and half is 4. 11 minus 1 is 10 and half is 5.

If we use the 90-degree method explained earlier we find that
the distance is 1 less than the smaller number. With 9 it would be 8
and with 11 it would be 10.

Try 21x31 and check your answer on the Square of Nine chart.

In our discussion of the geometric means between squares we saw
that the multiplication of any two numbers made a geometric mean
between the squares of the two numbers so all of our answers in the
discussion above are geometric means between squares.

When you multiplied 21x31 you found the geometric mean between
the square 21x21 and the square 31x31.

You might wonder if a number can serve as a geometric mean
between more than just two squares. Think about it a minute and you
can probably answer the question yourself.

Let's look once again at the number 30 from our discussion of
the successive squares. We found that 30 was the geometric mean
between the square of 5 and the square of 6. But 30 has factors other
than 5 and 6.

30 is also the product of 2x15 and 3x10 so it can be a geometric
mean between those squares like so:

2x2=4
2x15=30
15x15=225

3x3=9
3x10=30
10x10=100

In the first example we would have the series, 4, 30, 225 and
the second 9, 30, 100.

And checking our answers we can see that 4 times 225 is 900 and
9 times 100 is 900 and the square root of 900 is 30 so we have a
geometric series.

                                                                        74
Of course the multiplier for each would be different. The
multiplier for the first would be 30 divided by 4 and for the second
would be 30 divided by 9.

This sets up another interesting question you might ask. Can a
square itself be a geometric mean between two other squares?



Chapter 13-The Square as a Geometric Mean

The answer again is yes. Let's look at a familiar square, 144,
which is the square of 12, but it too has many other factors. I will
not mention all of them, just a couple to give you the idea.

9x16 is 144. Of course both 9 and 16 are squares, but that is
not the point here.

144, the square of 12, is the geometric mean between the square
of 9 and the square of 16 as shown below:

9x9=81
9x16=144
16x16=256

8x18 is also 144 so we could have:

8x8=64
8x18=144
18x18=324

If we multiply 81 times 256 or 64 times 324 we will find that
they equal 144x144.

Do a few for yourself, 2x72, 3x48, 4x36, etc. to prove to
yourself that a square itself can also be a geometric mean between
two other squares.

There are other observations to be made about the squares of the
Square of Nine chart, but they must be made in connection with the
single digit numbering system, the triangle numbers and the TELEOIS.

They will be dealt with in their proper place.

I believe that now when you look at the Square of Nine chart you
will be looking at it with a different frame of mind than before.

If I have only taught you one thing in this whole material, I
will be satisfied that I have accomplished the mission.

That is, when you read Gann or any other material about numbers,
you will look for: PATTERN, PATTERN, PATTERN!



                                                                       75
Book V
The Cycle of Venus

Chapter 1-A Star Returns

Welcome back explorer! Are you ready for another journey with me
as we explore the numbers of Gann? As I said in my earlier books you
can come with me and explore paths I have already been down, but that
does not mean you can't turn to the right and to the left to do some
exploring on your own.

On this journey we find ourselves back in olden times as we
heard that an ancient man went out in the morning and faced a rock in
the distance he had faced eight years earlier. And then, as it had
eight years ago, a bright star peeped over the rock.

His light had returned. His father had told him it would be so.
His grandfather before that said it would be so. They had also stood
at the same spot and peered at the same rock.

Their light had returned for them.

So let us return to those ancient days and sit down under the
same old tree and look at the same old rock that serves as a pointer
toward the sky.

We have been up all night in anticipation of the event and I
have nodded off when you awaken me.

"There it is! Just before the sunrise. Just where they said it
would be eight years ago!" you exclaim. Yes, I admit. Those ancient
men were right.

What was this star?

That's easy, you say. The "star" we saw was not a star at all,
but what we call today the planet Venus. But why does it return to
the same place every eight years. Was this Gann's eighth square, the
"death" zone?

In one sense it could be, but I don't believe so. There is
another logical explanation for the eighth square which is called the
"death zone," but that will be dealt with in its proper place.

Gann does not mention Venus by name. In fact, he does not
mention any planet by name in his regular material although he does
in his "private papers."

                                                                        76
But he does hint at some possibilities for Venus, including his
"cube of nine."

Those of you who have read my earlier books know that unlike
other writers I zero in on chapter and verse in the Gann material as
I take you on this exploration of the numbers of Gann. So let's get
to it.

We will look at the Fibonacci relationships, the cube, the
number 144, and the 15-day, 24-hour chart.

So you get out your heliocentric ephemeris and find that the
heliocentric (viewed from the sun) cycle of Venus is 225 days, which
means that in going its 360 degrees its average movement around the
sun is 1.6 degrees a day. Close to the "golden ratio" of 1.618.

You might have read that some writers have tried to associate
the movement of Venus with the movement of Uranus and the sun to
arrive at a 1.618 ratio.

Uranus' movement is very slow, going 360 degrees in 84 years.

So, let's select a synodic period of Uranus or the conjunction
of Uranus with the sun. (A synodic period is the conjunction of the
sun with any planet as seen from the earth).

I have picked a date from the time of Robert Gordon, the hero of
Gann's novel, "The Tunnel Thru the Air." It's an arbitrary date. You
can select any date you like if you have a geocentric ephemeris.

The date I have selected is Dec. 31, l906 when the sun and
Uranus were in conjunction at 8 degrees in Capricorn. Since the
geocentric (the view from earth) sun takes a year to make its
"revolution" and since Uranus has moved a few paces we know it will
be more than a year before they come into conjunction again.

So we find that on Jan. 4, 1908, they are in conjunction at 12
degrees in Capricorn or 5 days beyond a year or 370 days.

We can divide the heliocentric cycle of Venus, 225 days, into
370 and get 1.64444.

Since the two planets beyond Uranus (Neptune and Pluto) move at
a slower pace around the sun, their synodic periods would be less
than 370 days since the sun would make its cycle (actually the earth
moves, but the sun seems to move in the zodiac in the geocentric
view) and then catch them a little sooner than it catches Uranus.

If we divided 225 into those conjunctions or synodic periods we
would have an answer less than 1.64444 and therefore nearer to what
is considered the golden ratio of 1.618.

But, let's do this. Let us multiply the golden ratio times 225
and see what number of days we would need to have the ratio.
                                                                       77
225x1.618=364.05

What does that suggest?

Yes, you are way ahead of me.

Why use the heliocentric cycle of Venus with the geocentric
synodic periods of the outer planets?

We don't need them!

We can simply use the heliocentric cycle of Venus with the
heliocentric cycle of the earth and get a ratio much closer to the
golden ratio!

Dividing the heliocentric cycle of Venus into the heliocentric cycle
of the earth produces:

365.2422 (usually rounded off to 365.25) divided by 225=1.62329
I'm not putting down the work of those writers who want to use
Venus with Uranus, etc. They might have a good reason for using them.
But as far as the Fibonacci relationship is concerned, I believe we
have demonstrated that the Venus and earth relationship makes a
better fit.

I will have much more to say on Fibonacci relationships, but
that is for another study and would take us far afield to another
part of the woods and we need to stick to the work at hand.



Chapter 2-The Square of 144

We have seen that it takes Venus 225 days to go 360 degrees in
the circle, or 1.6 degrees a day. If Venus goes 1.6 degrees in one
day then how many degrees will it go in 360 days?

Venus goes 1.6 times 360 or 576 degrees.

Does that number look familiar?

Check your 15-day, 24-hour circular chart.

The number 576 can be divided by 4 to get 144! So, in 360 days
Venus goes 4 squares of 12 or 12x12x4.

If the earth went exactly 360 degrees in 360 days then 8 cycles
of Venus would equal 5 cycles of the earth.

The cycle of Venus at 225 days would be 5/8 of a year.

That 5 and that 8 would look pretty good as Fibonacci numbers.


                                                                        78
The division of 225 into 360 was 1.6. When we divide 5 into 8,
what do we get?

The same thing, 1.6. And even though it is not the "golden
mean," nevertheless it is still the ratio of two successive Fibonacci
numbers.

Let's go back and look at the relationship of Venus and the
earth again when we divided 225 days into 365.2422 and got 1.6232986.

Now, let's go a step up the Fibonacci ladder. We saw the
relationship between 5 and 8 and found it to be 1.6. Now let's look
at 8 and 13 by dividing 8 into 13.

We get 1.625.

We can see that 1.625 is a lot closer to the earth-Venus ratio
of 1.6232986 than 1.6. So let's give it a whirl.

The ancients had found that the "star" returned every 8 years.
Let's find the days in 8 years:

8x365.2422 = 2921.9376

Dividing by the 225 days that Venus needs to complete a cycle we
find that:

2921.9376 divided by 225 equals 12.986389, awfully close to 13
cycles that Venus makes to appear over that distant rock every eight
years.

To see how the ratio of 8 and 13 works with the cycle of Venus
and the cycle of the earth we can simply multiply 225 by 1.625 and
get 365.625.

Subtracting the solar year from our answer we have:

365.625-364.224 or .401 of a day difference, or about 9 hours a
year difference.

You have now found a Fibonacci relationship between the
heliocentric cycles of the earth and Venus. Being students of Gann
I'm sure you know what is meant by heliocentric, but for the few of
you that have not made that study, the heliocentric cycle of the
planets is the view from the sun, thus heliocentric.

The view of Venus from the earth is geocentric and sets up a
different set of numbers which we will explore later.

If the cycles of Venus and the earth are Fibonacci related we
can check out a few other Fibonacci relationships. So let's check
that relationship that seems to be a favorite of most writers.

That of 89 and 144.

                                                                        79
To get the days in 89 years we multiply thus:

89x365.2422 and get 32506.555

Dividing the days in 89 years by the 225 days it takes Venus to
make 360 degrees we get:

32506.555 divided by 225 equals 144.47357 cycles of Venus in 89
years.

I'll let you work with some of the other Fibonacci numbers in
the same way. After all why should I have all the fun!



Chapter 3-The Geo View and the Number 144

In Chapter 2 we saw that Venus goes 1.6 degrees a day and in 360
days it goes 1.6x360 or 576 degrees or 4 times 144 degrees.

But the earth goes more than 360 degrees in a year. We will drop
the fractional part for this discussion and just say that it takes
the earth 365 days to go around the sun. While the earth is going
those 365 days, Venus is going 1.6 times 365 or 584 degrees.

We saw earlier that Venus would go 576 or 4x144 degrees in 360
days so with the addition of those 5 days, Venus would go 8 degrees
more or 584 degrees.

We have to be careful here and not get days and degrees confused
although they can sometimes be the same thing.

And here we will switch to the geocentric view, the view of
Venus from the earth as noted earlier. Having a shorter period around
the sun then the earth, it is one of the two planets inside the
earth's orbit, the other being Mercury.

As viewed from the earth the planet does not seem to get too far
away from the sun, acting for awhile as the evening star and then as
the morning star depending on whether it is east or west of the sun
as seen from the earth.

Venus like Mercury has two conjunctions with the sun.
Conjunction means that two planets or a planet and the sun are in the
same degree of the zodiac at the same time.

One of the conjunctions is when Venus is behind the sun and the
other is when it is in front of the sun.

When it is behind the sun it is called a superior conjunction
and when between the earth and the sun it is called an inferior
conjunction.

I noted above that when the earth goes its 365 days, Venus goes
1.6x365 or 584 degrees and we must not get degrees and days confused,
                                                                        80
but sometimes they are the same. An astronomy book will tell you that
it takes 584 days to go from a conjunction to the same conjunction or
from one superior to another superior or from an inferior back to an
inferior.

We can check this by looking at a geocentric ephemeris so let's
check some dates.

I have chosen at random a rather recent date when the sun and
Venus were at superior conjunction, June 14, l992. You can
distinguish a superior conjunction from an inferior one, by its
position in the zodiac. If Venus proceeds to gain on the sun in the
zodiac, then it is going from west to east or from behind the sun to
the east.

We check in the ephemeris and find that on June 14, l992, Venus
and the sun were in superior conjunction at 23 degrees in Gemini. As
we go forward in time we see that Venus advances further and further
along the zodiac as the sun trails behind.
Then on June 11, l993, about a year later, it swings in front of
the earth and makes an inferior conjunction. It goes to the west and
then swings in back of the sun, making superior conjunction again on
Jan. l7, 1994 at 26 degrees in Capricorn.

You recall that Venus comes back to the same point in the sky
every 8 years so let's get the number of days in eight years:

8x365.25=2922

Then we divide by 584, the number of days taken to make an
inferior or superior conjunction.

2922 divided by 584=5.00342.

So Venus makes 5 conjunctions with the sun in the 8 years it
takes to get back to the same place in the sky and the ratio of 5 and
8 is 1.6.

Checking our ephemeris we started at June 14, l992 when the sun
and Venus were in superior conjunction at 23 degrees in Gemini.

The next 5 conjunctions after that date are:

Jan. l7, 1994 at 26 degrees Capricorn
Aug. 21, 1995 at 27 degrees Leo
April 3, 1997 at 13 degrees Aires
Oct. 31, l998 at 7 degrees Scorpio
June 12, 2000 at 21 degrees Gemini

That last one put us back where we started.

Here is another relationship between the cycle of Venus and the
number 144.

We noted above that it takes 584 days to go from superior
                                                                        81
conjunction to superior conjunction.

From superior conjunction Venus emerges to the east of the sun
and serves as the evening star. In 220 days it reaches its farthest
eastern elongation. Then it takes 144 days to go from eastern
elongation to western elongation passing between the earth and the
sun.

After reaching western elongation, it takes 220 days to get back
to superior conjunction. We add 220 + 144 + 220 and we have the 584
days from conjunction to conjunction.

We can make another interesting observation, 220+144 is 364 days
or a year in terms of weeks as 7x52 is 364. Or we can say it takes a
year to go from conjunction to eastern elongation to western
elongation.

Since it takes 144 days to go from eastern to western elongation
then it takes 72 days to go from eastern elongation to an inferior
conjunction with Venus between the sun and the earth.

Since we will be looking at some cubes in connection with the
cycle of Venus, let's have a look at one here.

If we subtract that 72 from 584 we have 512 days. Or from
inferior conjunction to western elongation to superior conjunction to
eastern elongation is a total of 512 days.

Divide that by 8 and we get 64 and divide again by 8 and we have
8 or 512 is the cube of 8.

Another interesting point:

In we subtract 144 from 584 we have 440, which is 10 times 44.
That number, 44, is more than just the low on beans in 1932 as we
will see as we explore more of the Gann material and make some side
trips in other material.

And 440 is 4 times 110. From your reading of the geometric means
between the squares you know that 110 is the geometric mean between
the square of 10 and the square of 11 since it is 10x11.

In his novel, "The Tunnel Thru the Air," we can see that the
main character, Robert Gordon, had his offices on the 110th floor of
69 Wall Street!

And that number is not mentioned just once in the book. It is
mentioned 4 times! On page 250, 336, 362 and 369.

Can you stand a little more?

440 is 8 times 55, which among other things, is a Fibonacci
number. We will be looking at those "other things" in our next book.



                                                                        82
Chapter 4-Venus and the Square of Nine Chart

If we started Venus and the earth at the vernal equinox or the
first point of Aires or March 2l on the Square of Nine chart, by the
time the earth reaches 225 degrees or 225 days Venus would have
returned to the starting point since it take 225 days to make its
full circle.

Continuing on, earth and Venus or Venus and the sun in eight
years would be back at the starting point.

Gann notes is his material that 225 degrees is squared.



Chapter 5-Geometric Means of the Cube

I'm sure that you, like me, have read that second page of
Chapter 9 in the commodity course many times and puzzled over it.

Gann makes much of the square, but when it comes down to it he
seems to say that the answer is in the cube. His use of a 3-D devise
he mentions in his advertising material would seem to indicate that.

For many years I believed that the cube of 9 or 9x9x9=729 was a
time period, but didn't know if it was weeks or days or months or
years or some other time period.

But I think I finally have the answer. But before we go into
that let's look at a concept I explained in Book IV-"On the Square":

--THE GEOMETRIC MEAN--

For those of you who have not read the book I will give a brief,
but not complete, recap of the section on the geometric mean.

Gann talks about the arithmetic mean, the half-way point,
between two numbers, but only hints at the geometric mean, the
evidence of which can be found in many places in the material.

The geometric mean is a number between two other numbers which
has a "multiple" principle instead of an "additive" principle.

If we take a number like 6 and add 3 to get 9 and then 3 to get
12, 9 is the arithmetic mean, the halfway point. 9 is 3 more than 6
and 3 less than 12.

To get a "geometric" mean, we multiply instead of add.

Using the same starting point of 6, we multiply by 3 to get 18
and multiply 18 by 3 to get 54 and 18 is the geometric mean of the
series of numbers 6, 18, 54.

An easy way to check to see if a number in the middle is a
                                                                       83
geometric mean, simply multiply the two end terms, in this case 6 and
54 to get 324, and take the square root which is 18.

To get the geometric mean of two squares you can simply multiply
the square roots of each square.

If we multiply 4x5 and get 20 we have the geometric mean between
the square of 4 or 16 and the square of 5 or 25. The "multiplier" is
1.25 because 16 times 1.25 is 20 and 20 times 1.25 is 25.

So pick out a couple of your favorite numbers and multiply them.
You have found the geometric mean between the squares of those two
numbers.

In Book 4-"On the Square" I noted the importance of the
geometric mean on the Square of Nine chart.

As I noted at that time, the same method for finding the
geometric mean between the squares can be used for finding the
geometric mean between numbers of any powers, squares, cubes, numbers
to the fourth power, fifth power, etc.
Let's use the geometric mean between two of our squares to kick
off this discussion. Let's look for the geometric mean between the
square of 6 and the square of 9.

6x6=36
6x9=54
9x9=81

To find the multiplier we simply divide 6 into 9 and get 1.5 or
one and a half.

36x1.5=54
54x1.5=81

We can check our answer by:

36x81=2916

And the square root of 2916 is 54.

Therefore 54 is the geometric mean between the square of 6 or 36
and the square of 9 or 81.

If we look at:

6x6
6x9
9x9

we can think of it as dropping one of the sixes from the first
line and putting in one of the 9's from the last line.

Let's put down three 6's instead of two and three 9's instead of
two like so:
                                                                        84
6x6x6
9x9x9

Before I go on you might want to pick up your calculator and see
if you can find the geometric means of the cube.

OK, let's give it a whirl.

First, let's spread the lines out so we can drop a 6 and put in
a 9.

6x6x6
6x6x9

We have found the first geometric mean between the cube of 6 and
the cube of 9.

Then we will spread the lines again and drop another 6 and put
in another 9 for the next line.

6x6x6
6x6x9
6x9x9

We have found the second geometric mean between the cubes.

And then in the last line we will drop all 6's and put in all
9's so we will have:

6x6x6
6x6x9
6x9x9
9x9x9

Now let's do our multiplication:

6x6x6=216
6x6x9=324
6x9x9=486
9x9x9=729

Take the four answers and divide the first into the second, the
second into the third and the third into the fourth.

324 divided by 216=1.5
486 divided by 324=1.5
729 divided by 486=1.5

PATTERN?

Yes, we have the same multiplier that we had when we were
finding the geometric mean between the squares, 6x6 and 9x9.

That's because 9 divided by 6 is 1.5. It works every time!
                                                                   85
If we put our four numbers down in this series 216, 324, 486,
729 what does that suggest?

We have "two" geometric means between the cubes whereas with the
squares we only had one geometric mean.

With the squares we could prove our answer by multiplying the
two end terms and taking the square root.

If we multiply the two end terms of the cubes 216 times 729 we
find that they equal the product of the two middle terms 324 times
486.

216x729=157464
324x486=157464

We can see from our box that the top row has three 6's and the
bottom three 9's and the two middle rows have three 6's and three 9's
and 6x6x6x9x9x9 is the same regardless of the order.

6x6x9x6x9x9 is equal to 6x6x6x9x9x9.

We found that the squares have one mean and the cubes two means.

PATTERN?

What if we wanted to find the geometric means between:

6x6x6x6
9x9x9x9

How many would we have?

Yes, you were a little quick for me that time. You had seen the
PATTERN. The number of means will be one less than the powers of the
numbers. Since 6x6x6x6 and 9x9x9x9 are 6 to the fourth power and 9 to
the fourth power than there must be three means.

We can check that by using the box method and dropping 6's and
adding 9's:

6x6x6x6
6x6x6x9
6x6x9x9
6x9x9x9
9x9x9x9

The top line represents 6 to the fourth power and the bottom
line represents 9 to the forth power and there are "three" lines in
between which represent the geometric means so there must be "three"
geometric means between numbers to the "fourth" power.

You can work it out for yourself by the same method we used
above with a different set of numbers.
                                                                        86
In my example what will the multiplier be?

It's still 1.5 or 9 divided by 6.

Give it a try. Use some other numbers. It's good practice for
finding PATTERNS.

I noted in my preface that our method would be simple,
observational arithmetic. No algebra involved. And you can see from
the above I did just that. Once a PATTERN is established, the rest is
easy.

In the above I used the "box" method, dropping one number and
adding another. However, we could have just used the multiplier.

Say we were looking for the geometric means between 6 and 9 to
the "fifth" power. We now know that we would have "four" geometric
means since "four" is one less that the "fifth" power. Using the
multiplier we would simply do this:

6x6x6x6x6=7776
7776x1.5=11664
11664x1.5=17496
17496x1.5=26244
26244x1.5=39366
39366x1.5=59049 which is 9x9x9x9x9

That works, but I like the box method better as it is more
graphic and lends itself to a better understanding of Gann's work.

In the preceding examples, I used the "natural" numbers. (The
natural numbers were explained in Book IV). But the method for
finding geometric means can be used for any numbers, even irrational
numbers like the square root of 5 (which is involved in the golden
mean) or pi. The same box method could be used.

Let's see how that would work. My computer does not have a
square root or pi symbol, so I will used SR5 for the square root of 5
and PI for pi. Let's assume we want to find the geometric means of
the cube of each.

We would make our "box" thus:

SR5xSR5xSR5
SR5xSR5xPI
SR5XPIxPI
PIxPIxPI

And the multiplier would be PI divided by SR5.




                                                                        87
Chapter 6-Venus and the Cube

In light of what you know now, reread the second page of Chapter
9, page 112 in the "old" commodity course (Section 10, Master Charts,
page 3, Square of Nine in the "new" course) and see if you can see
a PATTERN.

Gann talks about building the cube. He talks about the cube of 9
or 9x9x9. He also mentions 6 times the square of 9 or 6x81. We can
always (and we should, to look for PATTERNS) break down our numbers
into their component parts.

6x81 can also be read as 6x9x9 or 486. Check the work we did on
the cube in Chapter 5 and see if you can find that number.

Yes, we can see that that number is one of the geometric means
between the cube of 6 and the cube of 9.

As I mentioned earlier I always thought that the cube, 9x9x9,
stood for a time period of days, months, etc. Maybe those were your
thoughts, too.

I noted in Book I-"The Cycle of Mars" that Mars and Jupiter make
conjunctions approximately every 27 months and a cycle of 27 times 27
months would be 729 since the cube of 9 is also the square of 27.
There is another planetary cycle that could be applied here, but we
will not go down that path now.

The more I read that section of Gann the more I became convinced
that the cube was not a "time period" at all but a "division" of
time. In his discussion of the hexagon or six-sided figure he
mentions 30 years so I finally decided that maybe 30 years should be
divided into 729 parts.

30 years is:

30x365.2422=10957.266 days

10957.266 days divided by 729=15.030543 days

Interesting?

It should be.

15, among other things, is one of the divisions of the circle by
Gann.

We will get back to that, but let's have another look at that
geometric mean.

We saw that 9 divided by 6 is 1.5. We also know now from our
work that 729 divided by 486 is 1.5. If we divide 20 into 30 it is
also 1.5.


                                                                        88
Gann says we can use 486 or 729. Let's see what he meant by
that. If we divided 30 years by 486 what do we get?

10957.266 divided by 486 is 22.545814 or 22.5 days, another
division of the circle. Gann says you can go over 22.5 days on your
chart and reach 22.5 degrees in the circle.

And 22.5 divided by 15 is 1.5!

Now, let's reverse the process and divide 20 years by 729.

20x365.2422=7304.844

7304.844 divided by 729=10.020362 days and 10 divided into 15 is
1.5

All that is very interesting you say, but what does that have to
do with the cycle of Venus?

Then again you might be way ahead of me.

You will recall that the heliocentric period of Venus was 225
days and if we take the square root we find it is 15!

So the 30-year period divided by the cube of 9 equals the square
root of the cycle of Venus.



Chapter 7-The 15-Day, 24-Hour Chart

Is there any other clues that the cube could refer to the cycle
of Venus?

One could be the 15-day, 24-hour chart discussed on page 153 (in
my copy) of the Gann material.

He notes that the time periods of 15 days equal 24 degrees.

Since Venus goes 1.6 degrees in one day then in 15 days it would
go 24 degrees.

Gann ends this circular chart at 576 which is 24 squared, but it
is also 4x144 as we saw earlier. We found earlier that 360 times 1.6
is 576 and we also found that 225 times 1.6 is 360.

What does that suggest? Let me put down the numbers like this:

225, 360, 576

Got it now?

That's correct!

360 is the geometric mean between the square of 15 and the
                                                                       89
square of 24 and we can put down the numbers like this:

15x15=225
15x24=360
24x24=576

What else does it suggest from the three products above?

Remember how to verify a geometric mean?

That's right. We can multiply the two end terms and take their
square root and the answer will be the middle term.

Ah, hah. You just saw it! 225 times 576 is 360x360 or the square
of the degrees in a circle. 576 cycles of Venus equals 360x360!

This is just one of the examples of squaring the circle as you
have noticed from your reading of Gann. It is the only one I will
deal with here as the "square of the circle" is a study in itself.

There are also other explanations for the 15-degree, 24-hour
chart and again this is not the place for a discussion of those as it
would take us far afield and we want to keep to the discussion at
hand.



Chapter 8-Venus and the Harmonic Mean

I am going to put down four number and let you have a look at
them:

90, 144, 225, 360

Recognize them? The 90 is Gann's 90 degree angle, the 144 is the
square of 12, the 225 is his 5/8 of a circle and square and also the
cycle of Venus and the 360 is the degrees in a circle.

They have a special relationship and we will look at them a
little bit later. But first some background.

In Book IV-"On the Square" I noted that the ancients recognized
10 different "means" and those 10 could be the basis of the tetraxes
of Pythagorus. We looked at two those means in that book and I have
given a recap in this one, but let's look at them once more.

The arithmetic mean is Gann's halfway point. The usual way used
by most writers is to take two numbers like 6 and 12, subtract them
to find their difference, take half of the difference and add to the
smaller number to find the half-way point.

12 minus 6 is 6 and half of 6 is 3 and 3 added to 6 is 9 and 9
is the arithmetic mean between 6 and 12.

Gann's method was a lot simpler. He added the smaller to the
                                                                        90
larger and divided by 2. Six plus 12 is 18 and 18 divided by 2 is 9.
Using simple numbers like this, the two methods don't really differ
in ease of use, but when using bigger numbers Gann's method is
easier.

The low on beans in 1932 was 44 and the high in 1948 was 436.
Gann added the two to get 480 and divided by 2 to get 240, the
arithmetic mean, which in this case also ended up being the 2/3 point
of the circle (240 is 2/3 of 360).

We also saw that the geometric mean was the middle number
between two other numbers which was arrived at by multiplying the two
end numbers and taking the square root. We used squares to make the
task simpler.

We found that the geometric mean between the square of 6 and
square of 9 could be found thus:

6x6=36
6x9=54
9x9=81

We could prove the answer by multiplying the end terms and
taking the square root to find the middle term.

As I said before, we used squares for simplicity, but
multiplying two numbers and taking the square root works for any two
numbers. Instead of finding the geometric mean between the "square"
of 6 and the "square" of 9 we could find the geometric mean between
the number 6 and the number 9.

We could take the square root of each and multiply them or we
could simply multiply the two and take the square root which in this
case would be the square root of 54 or 7.3484692. When we are using
single numbers like this the "multiplier" is the square root of their
ratio or the square root of 1.5 or 1.2237448 and 6 times the square
root of 1.5 times the square root of 1.5 will be 9.

If we wanted to find the geometric mean between 44 and 436 we
could take the square root of 44 and the square root of 436 and
multiply the answers or we could simply multiply 44 times 436 and
take the square root, which incidently is

44x436=19184
and the square root is 138.50631.

Dividing 44 into 138.50631 we find that the multiplier is
3.1478706. Now multiply 3.1478706 times 138.50631.

Are you surprised that the answer is 436. No, you're not
surprised. You knew it would be all along!

The other mean I mentioned in Book IV-"On the Square" was the
"harmonic" mean.

                                                                        91
The harmonic mean is a little difficult to understand at first
glance but easily found, so no worry.

The harmonic mean is that number between two other numbers which
is the same percentage greater than the smaller number as it is
smaller that the greater.

I know that's a mouthful, but a few examples will make it
clearer.

Let's use 6 and 12 again as we did to find the arithmetic mean:

6, 12

Now we want to find a number so that it will be the same
percentage greater than the smaller as it is less than the larger and
I will insert it here for the illustration:

6, 8, 12

If we take 1/3 of 6 or 2 and add it to 6 we get 8 and if we take
1/3 of 12 which is 4 and subtract it from 12 we get 8 so 8 is the
"harmonic" mean between 6 and 12.

You might have done that by trial and error. But there is an
easier way to find the harmonic mean. Study the numbers again and see
if you can find the answer.

I'll throw in another number to see if it helps:

6, 8, 9, 12

Got it now? Remember earlier we found that 9 was the arithmetic
mean between 6 and 12.

Got it?

I'll bet you have if you have looked at very many Gann numbers.

The two end terms multiplied equal the two middle terms
multiplied.

What does that suggest?
Try this. Multiply the two end terms and divide by the
arithmetic mean.

6x12=72
72 divided by 9 (the arithmetic mean) equals 8, the harmonic
mean.

In addition to the percentage method, we can check the harmonic
mean in another way.

12 is 2 times 6
6 from 8 is 2
                                                                        92
8 from 12 is 4
2 times 2 is 4

or the distance from the harmonic mean to the larger number is 2
times the distance from the smaller number to the harmonic mean.

Any group of numbers you can put down will have ratios to each
other. If you multiply all the numbers by another number you will
change the numbers but not the ratios.

We can put down

6, 8, 9, 12

and multiply each by 2 so that we have

12, 16, 18, 24

24 is twice 12

18 is the arithmetic mean and 16 is the harmonic mean.

Try a few!

We found that the harmonic mean between two numbers in which
one, 12, was twice the other, 6.

Now let's try one where the larger is 3 times the smaller.

Again starting with 6:

6, 18

We will add the arithmetic mean by adding 6 to 18 and dividing
by 2.

6, 12, 18

Now can you find the harmonic mean?

By trial and error you could have found that half of 6 is 3 and
3 plus 6 is 9 and that half of 18 is 9 and 18 minus 9 is 9 and
therefore you have found the harmonic mean.

But you could have found it the easy way. Did you?

6x18=108
108 divided by 12 is 9

So we have 6, 9, 12, 18

18 is three times 6
The distance from 6 to 9 is 3 and the distance from 9 to 18 is 9
and 3x3 is 9. Just another way to check the harmonic mean.

                                                                    93
Now let's try numbers in which the larger is four times the
smaller. We could use 6 as the smaller again, but this would lead to
some fractions and would still be right, but it looks better using
natural numbers.

If we used 6 we would have 6, 15, 24 and 144 divided by 15 would
give us a fraction so let's start from 10 instead:

10, 40

10 plus 40 divided by 2 gives 25 for the arithmetic mean:

10, 25, 40

Can you find the "harmonic mean" the easy way?

If you said 400 divided by 25 you are correct. So our four
numbers would be:

10, 16, 25, 40

Checking it we find that 16 is 60 percent or .6 more than 10 and
40 minus 60 percent of 40 or 24 equals 16 so 16 is correct as the
harmonic mean.

Since 40 is 4 times 10 we find that the distance from 10 to 16
is 6 and 4 times 6 is 24, the distance from 16 to 40. Just another
way to prove the harmonic mean.

Earlier I told you to put down these numbers:

90, 144, 225, 360

Now look at 10, 16, 25, 40

PATTERN?

Yes, we simply multiplied the numbers in one series by 9 to get
the other series. Remember, we can multiply a series of numbers by
the same number and get different numbers, but we will have the same
ratio.

So now we have another relationship between 144 and 225 or the
cycle of Venus. If we use 90 as the starting point and 360 as the end
point then 225 equals the arithmetic mean and 144 the harmonic mean!

You will also note that 144 is 1.6 times 90 and Venus goes 1.6
degrees a day and when the earth goes 90 degrees Venus goes 144.

Those four numbers, 10, 16, 25, 40, can be multiplied by
different numbers and you will arrive at other interesting
relationships, but I will let you do that.

After all, as I said earlier, why should I have all the fun!

                                                                        94
I noted in Book IV-"On the Square" that there is no need to go
way up in numbers to prove a PATTERN. If it works at the bottom of
the ladder, it works at the top.

For example we could simply start from the number 1, the
beginning of all numbers (in more ways than one, and that's no pun!)
Let's divide our 10, 16, 25 and 40 by 10 and we get 1, 1.6, 2.5
and 4.

1.6 is the harmonic mean between 1 and 4.

Try that for some other series of numbers, like between 1 and 2,
1 and 3, 1 and 5, etc. and then multiply by some other numbers to get
a similar series.



Chapter 9-Gann's 15-day Chart
Market traders use a variety of charts. I have seen charts for
5-minute periods, 30-minute periods, hour-periods and the usual day,
week and monthly charts.

What determines a time period for a chart? I suspect that some
people use 5-minute charts because others use them. But it seems
rather arbitrary. There should be a reason for keeping the type of
charts that we do.

Gann kept some unusual charts with some unusual price increments
as can be seen from his moon chart. He had a two and a quarter day
chart and often a 2 or 3-day chart.

Let's look at one that should be in your possession. It is the
15-day Dow-Jones chart of the early 1940's, one in which his 45-
degree lines, etc. and his lines coming up from zero seem to be right
on target.

The dates on this chart are awfully hard to figure. Ink blots
and what appears to be an attempt to obliterate some of the dates
with ink remover makes this a very difficult chart to study.

I have just about ruined my eyes studying some of the Gann
material. I even used magnifying glasses several years ago on one
chart. Those studies took a large toll on my eyes, but it paid off as
I found some Gann markings well hidden and in one search found a
faint outline of the Mars line on his cotton chart.

On the Dow-Jones 15-day chart we are now looking at you will
notice along the bottom of the chart just above the dates that Gann
associated an hour with the 15 days. It appears to start with 8:30
a.m. and the next 15 days is 9:30 a.m. and the next 15 days, 10:30
a.m. etc. This he probably connects to his 15-day, 24-hour chart.

Follow this chart on out to the end. it seems to end sometime in
September of 1951.

                                                                        95
Along the bottom where he keeps a running total of the weeks
from the beginning it seems to end at about 225.

PATTERN?

We now know that the square root of 225 is 15 so if we have 225
cycles of 15 days we must have a cycle of 15x15x15 days which is a
cube and we are back to Gann's idea of the cube.

We also know that the cycle of Venus is 225 days.

PATTERN?

Yes, this period would represent 15 cycles of 225 days in the
same way that it represents 225 cycles of 15 days.



Chapter 10-Venus and the Square of 45

In Gann's private papers, he has one called "Soy Beans, Price
Resistance Levels." Look on page 2, under the heading active angles
and degrees. He says that the square of 1 is 1 and 1 is the sun and 1
added to 8 is 9, the square of 3 and completes the first important
odd square and is important for time and price.

For many years I thought he meant that the nine planets would
represent 9x9, but then I followed another line of thought.

Let's number the planets from the sun starting with the sun as
1. Then Mercury would be 2 and Venus would be 3.

If we square 3 to get 9 and then multiply that times 225, the
cycle of Venus, what do we have?

9x225 or

3x3x15x15 or

3x15x3x15 or

45x45!

Need I say more?



Chapter 11-The Eighth Square, The "Death Zone"

Earlier I said I did not believe the 8-year cycle of Gann was
the "eighth square, or death zone."

For years I wondered what Gann was talking about when he
referred to the "death zone." I have seen some of the works of other

                                                                        96
writers on the subject and they seem to have some validity.

I am not an astrologer nor astronomer, but have read several
books on both subjects. But, it was when I was reading one particular
book that it finally dawned on me what Gann meant.

And it should have been obvious all along!

Let's look at chapter 9 again, page 111 in the "old" course, bottom of
the page (Section 10, Master Charts, page 2, Master '12' Chart, in the
"new" course). Gann is talking about the square of 12 or 12 times 12 or
144.

Among other things he notes that the eighth and ninth "zone" are
hardest to pass because this is the death zone.

Let's first put the square of 12 in perspective to the circle.
It appears here that Gann has taken the circle of 360 degrees and
divided it into 144 parts and each part would therefore represent 2.5
degrees.

The first 12 parts then would be 30 degrees since 2.5 times 12
equals 30.

The end of the 7th zone then would be 210 degrees and the
beginning of the eighth zone would be at 211 degrees. If we look at a
diagram of the zodiac we can see that this would be the beginning of
the zodiacal sign Scorpio.

There is an expression from the Bible of "Oh death, where is
thy sting?" And we all know that scorpions kill with a stinger.

Let's look back again at Gann's private papers on soybeans, this
time the third page, third paragraph, where he says that below 304
the price will be in the bear sign Scorpio, a fixed sign and will
indicate lower prices.

I believe you will agree with me that a bear market or going
down market would be described as a "dying market."

Back to the 12x12 square. We could make a case that the eighth
year is the death zone if we base our 12x12 on the movement of
Jupiter. Jupiter makes its cycle in approximately 12 years or 144
months or 2.5 degrees per month and through a sign of 30 degrees in
one year. Starting from the zero point in Aires, Jupiter would be in
Scorpio in the eighth year of its cycle.

Getting back to Venus, we noted that Venus makes its cycle in
225 days. If we started Venus and the earth in a helio circle (as
seen from the sun) from 0, when the earth gets at 225, Venus is at
360.

Where is this 225? Looking at a design of the zodiac we find
that 225 is in the exact middle of Scorpio since Libra ends at 210.
15 degrees more or 225 would be at 15 degrees Scorpio.
                                                                          97
We might say that when the earth is dying in Scorpio Venus is
being reborn in a new cycle at 0 degrees in Aires.

And as some would say, without death there is no life.

I mentioned earlier that I found the evidence for this in a book
on astrology. It is a book easily found so that you can look it up
for yourself without buying a book on astrology.

It is one of the Time-Life books you have seen advertised on TV,
but is probably available at your local library as that is when I
found mine.

The name of the series is "Mysteries of the Unknown" and the
name of the book in the series is "Cosmic Connections." On page 120
it gives the qualities of the different houses of the zodiac and on
the opposite page it shows the location of the different houses in
the equal house system.

There are many "house systems" in astrology and Gann used at
least two of them, as can be seen from his private papers, but for
this purpose we will assume equal houses and make signs and houses
the same.

You will notice that the eighth house is the house of death and
the eighth sign or house is Scorpio! It should have been obvious to
me a long time ago. But sometimes it take a long time for things to
sink in.

I will venture to say that even those Gann writers who claim to
have great knowledge of astrology never made that connection to
Gann's death zone!

PATTERN! PATTERN! PATTERN!

We must never stop looking for PATTERNS when we study Gann or
any other numbering system. If we do, even the obvious will get by
us!

When we looked at the cube, we were looking for the relationship
between the cube of 6 and the cube of 9.

Is there any other clue in the Gann material for the use of
these two numbers?

In his novel, "The Tunnel Thru the Air," we see that his main
character, Robert Gordon, was born in the 6th month (June) on the 9th
day in the year 1906. Dropping the 1 and the zero in the year we see
that it is 9 and 6.

On page 194 of the novel we see that his office on Wall street
was at 69! If we turn that number on its side we see that we have a
zodiacal symbol, the crab or cancer.

                                                                        98
An astrological writer before the turn of the century made much
of the two numbers and noted their "sexual" connotation which I will
not go into here, but just note it in passing.

That astrological writer also made much of the numbers 3, 5, and
7, which are Masonic numbers and Gann was a Mason.

If we add the numbers their total is 15. And by now I'm sure I
don't have to tell you what that number is.
If we square them and multiply them we will have the square of
105 times 105. And if we divide that by 30 we will have 367.56.
Another way to put it is, the square of 105 equals approximately 30
years.

The answer is also the square of a triangle and that number is
found in the ratio of the Great Pyramid and contains all the cubes
one to 14.

More on that next time.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this as much as I have enjoyed
writing it. The search for the PATTERNS in Gann and other mystical
number writing is a never ending search for PATTERNS.

You might not agree with all I have had to say and you might
think that the relationship between Venus and the cube is
coincidental.

But the coincidences in Book I, Book II, Book III, Book IV and
Book V are certainly piling up.

And remember. Gann had a square of 90 and a square of 144 and
their ratio is 1.6, the same as the heliocentric Venus cycle of 225
and the degrees in a circle, 360, and Venus goes 1.6 degrees a day!




                                                                       99
Book VI
The Triangular Numbers

Chapter 1-Foolin' Around

As I told you in my preface, I'm not a mathematician. My
background is journalism. I had some algebra in high school and in
college, but I have forgotten everything I ever learned.

As they say, if you don't practice it you will forget it.

In my early days of Gann study I often found myself with my
calculator in hand, adding numbers, subtracting them, etc. Just
doodling you might say or just foolin' around to see if I could come
up with some interesting numbers that would coincide with some Gann
numbers.

When I came up with an interesting number, I would divide it by
Gann's numbers and see if I could come up with some other interesting
Gann numbers.

One day I was simply adding the "natural numbers" in order.

I explained "natural numbers" in another book, Book IV-"On the
Square." They are simply the "counting numbers" that we use every
day, starting with 1, 2, 3, etc. and have no fractions or decimals,
etc.

As I was doing this a number popped up in the calculator, 666.

That was a number I was familiar with from my Bible reading and
one that I am sure most of you are familiar with.

This is not the place to go into the religious connotations of
that number.

My interest in it at that time was how I arrived at it. So I
cleared the calculator and started from 1 again, putting in 2, 3, 4,
etc. on up to the number 36 at which time the number 666 popped up on
the screen again.

So, 666 is arrived at by adding all the natural numbers from 1
through 36.

I picked out some other numbers and added up through them, some
squares, some Gann numbers, 144, etc.

Interesting, but I didn't really know what I was doing.
                                                                        100
Do you know what I was doing?

If you do, you already have a leg up on this study. If you
don't, don't worry, I'll let you learn along with me as we explore
some more "PATTERNS of Gann."

I spent lots of time starting from 1 and putting in 2, 3, etc. I
might have even gone up to 666 itself. Can't remember now, but if I
did I know it would have taken me a long time.

I still have slips of paper showing where I started with 1 and
went up to 144, hoping that along the way I did not put in a wrong
number as that would have thrown me off the trail of some big number
and I would have to start all over again.

A short time later I was foolin' around again. I had multiplied
some numbers, etc. and then divided by 2 and I got 666.

Now how did I get that?

I kept playing around with the numbers and finally figured out
that if I took half of the number I wanted to find (by adding from 1
up through that number), I could simply take half of the number and
multiply it by the next number.

So if I wanted to add from 1 up through 36, I could take half of
36 and multiply it by 37.

36/2=18
18x37=666

I also found that I could take half of the next number and
multiply it times the original number and get the same result:

37/2=18.5
18.5x36=666

So, by taking half of one of the numbers and multiplying it
times the other I would have my answer.

In doing mental calculations it would be easy (to get rid of the
fractions) to do it like this:

If I was looking for the answer to an even number, I would take
half of it and multiply by the next. If I was looking for the answer
to an odd number I would take half of the next number and multiply it
by the original number.

For example, in finding 36, I would take half and multiply by
37. But, if i were looking for 37, I would take half of 38 and
multiply by 37.

Try a few numbers for yourself and while you are doing it tell
me an easier way of doing it.
                                                                        101
Go on, try a few, give it a whirl, they won't bit you. I'll take
a breather for awhile.

What? You're back already?

You figured it out faster than I did! I was still a little slow
then and looking for PATTERNS was something that was still far down
the road for me. I was usually just foolin' around.

Well, let's see what you found.

You figured out that if you took half of one number and
multiplied it by another that was the same thing as multiplying the
two numbers and then dividing by two.

So instead of taking half of 36 which is 18 and multiplying by
37, you simply multiplied 36 times 37 and got 1332 and then divided
by 2 to get 666.

That's probably what I did that day when I said I was
multiplying some numbers and divided by 2 and got 666, but had
forgotten what I did.

So now we have found an easy way to find our numbers without
starting from 1 and adding 2, 3, 4, etc.

If we want to know what 1 plus 2, plus 3, etc. on up through 144
totals all we have to do is:

144x145=20880
and 20880 divided by 2 is 10440.

That's certainly a lot easier than starting from 1 plus 2, etc.

So, if you didn't get it the first time, try a few now.

Years after I made the above "discovery" I read in a math book
that a mathematician by the name of Gauss, who lived a few hundred
years ago, worked it out at the age of 8.

The teacher asked his class what would the answer be if you
added 1 plus 2, plus 3, all the way up to 100. Almost immediately he
raised his hand and gave the answer.

Now you and I pretty much know how he did it. But why does it
work? Why divide by 2? Gauss probably divided 100 by 2 and got 50
and then multiplied by 101.

Let's see if we can find out why. Let's put down the natural
numbers from 1 to 12.

1
2
3
                                                                       102
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

Look at the list. Gauss divided 100 by 2 and multiplied by 101.

We are going to divide by 2 to get 6 and multiply by 13.

Look at the list above.

PATTERN?

Think of pairs.

Got it now?

Let's take the 1 from the top and add it to the 12 at the bottom
to get 13 and put it aside.

Now take 2 from the top and add it to 11 at the bottom and put
those numbers aside.

PATTERN?

Yes, we are making pairs and when we get done we will have 6
"pairs" of numbers and each pair will have a value of 13 and 6 times
13 is 78 which is what you would get if you added 1 plus 2, etc. up
through 12.

And that's what I did when I took half of 36 and got 18. I had
18 pairs of numbers and each pair had a value of 37.

Gauss was doing the same thing. Dividing 100 by 2 gave him 50
pairs and each pair had a value of 10l.

So that tells us why it works.

But, it is much simpler in actual practice to multiply 12 times
13 and divide by 2. The value of this will be seen when we deal with
the "unnatural numbers."



Chapter 2-An Ancient Arit hmetic Man

We have learned what to do, but what does it mean?

We have found a simple way to add from 1 up through any number,
but is there a name we can give to what we are doing?
                                                                       103
When I was doing the this work in the early 1980's I was looking
through a book on Masonry and saw a picture of something called the
"tetraxes."

It was a picture of 10 dots with a triangle drawn around the
dots. There was a dot on top, then 2 in the second row, 3 in the
third row and 4 in the fourth row.

They added to 10 and suppose to contain a secret.

I noted in Book IV-"On he Square" that the ancients recognized
10 "means" and maybe that was represented by the tetraxes.

But, I thought maybe the tetraxes simply represented what it
was, four numbers that added up to 10.

Then I found a book in an office where I had gone to see about a
job and in it was a section on an ancient "arithmetic man."

I call him an arithmetic man because he never claimed to be a
mathematician. Like my work, he presented it without algebra, just
simply observational arithmetic.

And there I found what I suspected all along. A picture of the
tetraxes, a triangle with dots inside which represented numbers and I
knew then what I had been making for quite sometime without knowing
it.

TR IA N GULA R N UMB ERS

It was a representation of 1 placed on top of 2, placed on top
of 3, placed on top of four, etc.

Let's look at that in a graphic representation. But instead of
using dots let's use numbers and place them on top of each other. We
will use squares to hold the numbers so you can get the idea.

Many years ago grocery stores made floor displays by stacking
cans on top of each other, starting with a certain number on the
bottom row, putting one less each time on the next row, etc. until
they got up to the top row which had only one can.

Standing off and looking at the display you would see something
that resembled a triangle or pyramid (we must not confuse triangular
numbers with pyramid numbers though so let's call the display a
triangle).

So, let's make some floor displays with cans and the squares
below will represent the cans and we will number the cans (squares)
in each display.
The first triangle:

                                                1

                                                                        104
contains one can or the triangle of 1.


The second triangle:
                                                        1

                                                    2        3

contains three cans or the triangle of 2.
The third triangle:

contains 45 cans or the triangle of 9.

My program does not allow me to take the spaces from between the
different rows so I could put the rows on top of each other but I think
you get the idea.

Looking along the right hand side of the triangle you can see
the total from the first to the last can in the triangle.

Now that we have the idea of the triangular numbers, in the next
chapter we will use just the numbers themselves.



Chapter 3-Making the Triangular Numbers

To me, the triangular numbers are more interesting than the
squares because of their use in making other figures.

Later we will have a look at some triangular numbers in the Gann
material and their importance to the Square of Nine chart and the
Hexagon chart.

But first, let's make some of the triangular numbers in a list
so you don't have to be using your calculator so much.

The first number in the list will be the number we will be
adding each time and the second number will be the running total or
                                                                                                               107
the triangular numbers.

(You might think of the numbers on the left as being the root of
the triangle in the same way as you think of a number as being a root
of a square. For example the root of the square of 16 is 4. The root
of the triangle of 10 is 4. That is, when we add up through 4 we will
have the number 10. I don't know if there is any such thing in
mathematics as the root of a triangle. If not I'm coining that phrase
right here! We will say that the triangle of 4 is 10 in the same way
that Gann said the square of 9 is 81, meaning 9 squared and not the
square root of 9, which is 3.)

For right now we will be making the triangular numbers from 1
through 49:

  1    1

Have a look at the numbers. You will recognize those we did. The
triangle of 12 is 78. The triangle of 36 is 666.

There is another Biblical number by the same writer (of 666)
which is also found in the pyramids. But we will deal with that at a
later time because we do not want to go far afield, but keep to the
work at hand.

You might also recognize some numbers from Gann. There are some
in the Gann material that are well hidden, but can be found with some
careful digging. Before we start looking for numbers in the Gann
material, let's look at some of the properties of the triangular
numbers. And always remember to keep your eyes open for

PATTERNS

Look at the numbers again. Play with them a little and see if
you can find a

PATTERN

Hint. Think squares.

Found it?

Let's look at the first two numbers, 1 and 3. They add to 4, the
square of 2.

Can you take it from there?

Let's take the 3 and add to the next number, 6. We get 9, the
square of 3.

Got it now?

                                                                        109
Pick out two successive numbers anywhere in the list. Add them
and take the square root.

Ok. You say 666 and 703.

666+703=1369
The square root of 1369 is 37.

PATTERN?

Yes, add any successive triangular numbers and your answer will
always be a square.
And what is that square?

It is the square of the root of the second triangular number. We
added the triangle of 36 or 666 to the triangle of 37 or 703 and the
square root was 37.

We can see why that is.

Remember that Pythagoras used a series of 1, 2, 3 and 4 dots to
represent the triangle of 4 or 10. Then if we made a triangle of 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 dots to represent the triangle of 5 or 15 we could push
the two triangles together and have a square, the square of 5.

So, put down 5 rows of 5 dots to represent the square of 5
or 5x5=25.

Now if we rotated this square so that the left top corner was
straight up and the right bottom corner was straight down we would
have something looking like a baseball diamond and there would be a
dot on top followed by two under that, then 3, etc.

Turn your head to the side and look at the square made up of
dots and you will get the idea. The number of dots going from top to
bottom or in our case from top left to bottom right are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

They form the square of 5 and the square is made up of two
triangles. The apex of the two triangles are at top left and bottom
right and the bases run along the two rows that contain the 4 dots
and the five dots.

Then we could add them. On the top diagonals we would have
1+2+3+4=10.

Counting from the bottom we would have 1+2+3+4+5=15.

And 10+15=25, the square of 5.

Let's make that a little more graphic. Instead of using dots
were will use numbers and put those numbers inside little squares.

And I have numbered the squares 1 and then 1, 2 and then 1, 2, 3
                                                                        110
to show how many numbers (dots) are in each row.

And then I have renumbered them to show the total going up to 10
from one corner and up to 15 from the other, representing two
triangles, one consisting of 10 dots and the other 15.

And from that we can see that the triangle of 4 or 10 plus the
triangle of 5 or 15 is equal to 25 or the square of 5x5.

Look at the numbers again. See another PATTERN?

Since we have 1, 2, 3, 4 from one end and 1, 2, 3, 4 from the
other and 5 in the middle, what does that suggest?

If we double the triangle of 4 (2x10) and add the middle number
we also have 25. So two times any triangular number plus the addition
of the next number (the number itself and not its triangle) equals
the square of the next number. Try a few for yourself.

How to make triangles and how to add them to form squares, I
learned from the ancient arithmetic man.
But, I also made a lot of my own discoveries. They are probably
known by mathematicians. And then again, maybe not!

That's the nice thing about studying PATTERNS, they often lead
to other PATTERNS.

Let's put down three triangular numbers in a row. For example
the triangles of 4, 5, and 6.

They are 10, 15, 21.

See any PATTERN?

We could add them:

10+15+21 and get 46.

No PATTERN there, at least not one I can see.

We could multiply them.

10x15x21=3150

Can't see anything there either.

Any suggestions?

Let's multiply the two end terms, 10x21 and get 210.

Any PATTERN?

No, but what if we ADDED the middle term, which is 15.

Then we would have 225, the square of the middle term, 15.
                                                                        111
As I noted in Book IV-"On the Square," we don't have to go way
up in numbers to check for PATTERNS. We can always use the bottom of
the ladder and if it works there it probably works anywhere.

So starting from the bottom of the ladder we can put down the
triangular numbers of 1, 2, 3 and get:

1, 3, 6

And 1x6=6 and 6+3 is 9, the square of the middle number. So that
probably works every time. Try a few and prove it to yourself.

There is another relationship between the triangular numbers and
the squares.

Look at the three numbers below:

10, 16, 10

Let's add them. 10+16+10=36

PATTERN?

We know from our triangular list that 10 is the triangle of 4.
Sixteen is not a triangle, but it is a square. The square of 4.

PATTERN?

36 is a square, but from our triangular list it is also the
triangle of 8.
Let's try three more numbers:

15, 25, 15

We know from our triangular list that 15 is the triangle of 5.
25 is not a triangle, but we know that it is the square of 5. Let's
add them:

15+25+15=55

55 is not a square as 36 was, but it is the triangle of 10.

PATTERN?

Yes, I can see the gleam in your eyes.

Two times the triangle of any number plus the square of that
number equals the triangle of a number that is double the first
number.

In our first example we saw that two triangles of 4 (2x10) plus
the square of 4 (4x4) equals 36 and 36 is the triangle of 8 which is
2 times 4.

                                                                       112
In our second example we saw that two triangles of 5 (2x15) plus
the square of 5 (5x5) equals 55 and 55 is the triangle of 10 which is
2 times 5.

PATTERN made!

It even works with 1:
1, 1, 1

The triangle of 1 is 1 and 2x1=2. The square of 1 is 1 and 1
plus 2 is 3. 3 is the triangle of 2 and 2 is 2x1.

(You will find, as I pointed out in Book IV-"On the Square" that
the number 1 represents more than just the single digit 1. It can be
a single number, a square, a number to any power and a triangle among
other things. That's why the natural numbers begin with 1 and not
zero, which has puzzled Gann students for a long time. But now you
know!)



Chapter 4-Making Other Numeric Figures

We will get back to the triangular numbers and where they appear
in the Gann material later, but let's first go on and make some other
"numeric figures."

In Book IV-"On the Square," I said that instead of drawing a
square, we would be making squares numerically. And I showed how that
was done by adding the odd numbers and noted that other figures could
be made by the same method.

We have seen how that method was used to make triangular
numbers, but that ancient arithmetic man also showed how to make some
other number figures.

The next figure we will make is a 5-sided figure called a
pentagon.

We will put down the numbers to make those figures. The first
numbers will be the numbers with which to make the pentagon and the
running total will be the pentagon numbers themselves.

1     1
4     5
7     12
10    22
13    35
16    51
19    70
22    92
25    117
28    145
                                                                        113
31   176
34   210
37   247
40   287
43   330
46   376
49   425

Now, without comment, let's make the hexagon numerically. That
is, let's make a 6-sided figure. Again the numbers to make the
hexagon will be the first numbers. The hexagon numbers which are a
running total of the first will be the numbers in the second row.

1    1
5    6
9    15
13   28
17   45
21   66
25   91
29   120
33   153
37   190
41   231
45   276

I had no comment on the 5-sided figure as I wanted to give you a
chance to look for PATTERNS and now I think we have enough material
down to give you that chance.

So what about it? PATTERN?

Look at the numbers with which we made the different sided
figures. I will remind you that in Book IV-"On the Square" we made
the squares using the natural odd numbers starting with 1 and the
numbers were 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.

Got it now?

Let's put down the numbers with which we "made" the different
figures in the order, triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons:

Give it another try.

Ok. Let's have a look at your work. You saw that in the first
row where we have the numbers with which we make the triangles, the
numbers are 1 unit apart. Add 1 to any unit and you have the next
unit. 1 plus 2 is 3, etc.

Looking under the squares you saw that the numbers were two
units apart. Add 2 to any unit and you get the next number. 3 plus 2
is 5, etc. (In our work on the square in Book IV-"On the Square" we
saw that this was Gann's variable of two.)

Looking under the pentagons you saw that the numbers were 3
units apart. That is, you can add 3 to any number and get the next
number. 3 plus 7 is 10, etc.

Under the hexagons you saw that the numbers used to make the
hexagon numbers were four units apart. That is, 1, 5, 9, etc.

I mentioned in my advertising material that I would tell you how
to make any sided figure very quickly.

So, quick now, how would you make a 33-sided figure?

Yes, knowing what you know now you could make a 7-sided figure,
an 8-sided figure and after a lot of other sided figures you would
know what numbers to use to make a 33-sided figure, but that would
take a lot of time and would not be very quick.

Have another look at the numbers under the triangle, square,
pentagon and hexagon.

PATTERN?

Under the triangle the numbers used to make a 3-sided figure are
1 unit part. Under the square, a 4-sided figure, the numbers used are
2 units apart. Under the pentagon or 5-sided figure the numbers are 3
units apart. Under the hexagon or 6-sided figure the numbers are 4
units apart.

Now how do you make a 33-sided figure?

Did you study the PATTERN?

If you did you noticed that the distance between the numbers
used are 2 less than the number of the sides.

Now how do you make a 33-sided figure?

If you said subtract 2 from 33 and get 31 and use numbers that
are 31 units apart you are correct and those numbers would be:

1. 1
32. 33
                                                                        115
63. 96, etc.

Look under the headings of the triangle, square, etc. again.

A good way to check if you are on the right track is to add the
first two numbers and they will add to the side you are making.

Under the triangle the first two numbers are 1 and 2 and that
equals 3 and we are making a 3-sided figure. Under the square the
first two numbers are 1 and 3 which equals 4 and we are making a
square, a 4-sided figure.

In the 33-sided example look at the first two numbers used to
make the 33-sided figure. They are 1 and 32 and they add to 33!

Now you know a fast way to make any sided figure you want to.

Quick now, how would you make a 12-sided figure?

That's right, the first two numbers would be 1 and 11 and you
would be using numbers which are 10 units apart since 10 is 2 less
than 12.

Give it a good try!!!!

I have shown you how to make the other figures for two reasons.

The first is to show you the importance of the number 1 and its
many characteristics. We know that the single digit is 1 and we also
know that 1 to any power, square, cube, whatever is still 1.

Now, in making the figures you have seen that it has other
characteristics. It is a triangular number, a square, a pentagon
number, a hexagon number and the first number of any sided figure, 33
or otherwise.

The second reason for looking at the other figures is to show
you the importance of the triangular numbers.

We have seen that any two successive triangles equal a square.

I am now going to put down the other sided figures and see if
you can make a PATTERN. I will simply put down the figures
themselves, not the numbers with which we make them. But in the first
row I will put the "terms."

                                   9     45       81    117 153

PATTERN?

We have used the terms to make the triangular numbers and when
we add any two successive triangles we get a square. Can you take it
form there?

You are correct if you said that when you keep adding the
triangular number after making the square you can make the other
figures.

3 (the triangle of 2) plus 6 (the triangle of 3) equals 9 the
square of 3. Add the triangular number 3 (the triangle of 2) to 9
and we get the pentagon number 12. Add 3 to that and we get the
hexagon number 15.

Add 28 to 36 gives 64. Add 28 to 64 gives 92. Add 28 to 92 gives
120.

So triangular numbers can be used to make any sided figure. We
could use this method without ever knowing the numbers it takes to
make up the various sided figures.

The names triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons are rather
common, but the larger numbers really have no names so when we are
expressing them we can simply say that they are a certain-sided
figure to a certain term.

We usually say the square of 4 instead of a square to the fourth
term. We could say the pentagon of 4 and the hexagon of 4 or simply a
pentagon to the fourth term, etc.

With the other sided figures we could say 33-sided to the fourth
term, etc.



Chapter 5-Gann's Triangular Numbers

I know this is the part you have been waiting to get to. In my
advertising material I said that unlike other Gann writers I zero in
on the numbers in the Gann material, citing chapter and verse. No
theories here.

I spent the first part of this book detailing the triangular
numbers because of their connection to the squares, etc. and because
of the part they play on the Square of Nine chart, etc.

Gann speaks of the triangles. I believe most writers think he is
referring to the large triangle within the circle, the one that
divides the circle into three equal parts of 120 degrees each. I'm
                                                                        117
sure Gann had that in mind, too.

But, I think his reference to triangles goes much deeper than
that. Although he does not refer to the triangular numbers, there
seems to be a lot of evidence for them in his material.

Under the heading "Time and Resistance Points According to
Squares of Numbers" on page 125 of the commodity course (in my copy,
maybe a different page in yours,) he says that stocks work out to the
square of some number or the triangle point of some number.

Some might believe he is referring to the large triangle in the
circle. But he doesn't seem to be talking about circles at this
point. It's squares and triangles.

I believe the best evidence for this is found on page 132 of the
"old" commodity course (Section 9, page 11, in the "new" course).

He talks about the 9 mathematical points for price culminations.

And then he adds:

"There are nine digits which equal 45, another reason why the
45-degree angle is so important."

You already know from your study now that the triangle of 9
(adding 1 through 9) equals 45!

Also on page 126 when he talks about the numbers for resistance
he notes that 45 is the "master of all numbers because it contains
all the digits from 1 to 9."

On page 112 of the "old" course (Section 10, Master Charts,
Square of 9, page 3, in the "new " course) under his discussion of the
Square of Nine chart, Gann says, "note the angles of 45 degrees
cross at 325, indicating a change in cycles here."

I have not figured out his 45 degree angles coming down, nor his
change of cycles, but from your triangular list you know that 325 is
the triangle of 25, a triangle of a square in the same way that 666
is the triangle of 36, also a square.

We don't have to go very far to find some more examples.

On the next page, page 113 in the "old course" (Section 10, Master
Charts, Hexagon Chart, page 4, in the "new "course). Talking
about the hexagon cycles, he says the sixth cycle is completed
at 91. We now know this to be the triangle of 13.

And then on down a few paragraphs he mentions 66 several times
and we now know this is the triangle of 11.

He even notes that we have an angle of 66 degrees. We noted
above that he talked about an angle of 45 degrees coming down from
325, the triangle of 25.
                                                                         118
There are many more triangular numbers in his material, but I
will let you do the searching for now. As I said in my earlier
material, why should I have all the fun!



Chapter 6-Triangles and the Square of Nine Chart

Get out your Square of Nine chart. Please!

Look at the line that starts at 8 and runs parallel to the line
containing the odd squares.

The numbers are:

8
24
48
80
120
168
224
etc.

PATTERN?

Study it closely in light of what you know about the triangular
numbers.

Got it now?

Maybe I can help:

1x8=8
3x8=24
6x8=48
10x8=80
15x8=120
21x8=168

Can you supply the next line to the help I have just given you?

If you said :

28x8=224

You are correct.

What does it mean? Look at the PATTERN again.

Got it now?

Yes, in each case we multiplied 8 times a triangular number. In
fact we multiplied 8 by the triangular numbers in order.
                                                                  119
Does that suggest anything?

I had known about the 8's for a long time, but it did not dawn
on me until recently about the possibility here.

Maybe you have already seen it.

See that 1 right there in the center. That is the number that
can be anything. If we add it to 8 what do we get?

8+1=9 the square of 3.
Want to do one?

How about 168+1=169 the square of 13?

PATTERN?

Yes, that's right. If you multiply 8 times any triangular number
and add 1, you will have a square.

More specifically, you will have an odd square. So, let's try
one at random. One we have not looked at yet.

We know from our previous work and noted in the Gann material
that 91 is the triangle of 13.


We multiply 8 times 91 and get 728. We add 1 and get 729 and we
also know from earlier work that 729 is the square of 27.

So now we know that if we multiply the triangular numbers by 8
in order and add 1 we will get the odd squares in order.

Is there a name we can give to this phenomenon?

You start with 1 and put 8 around it, then two 8's and then
three 8's. Gann did something similar with the hexagon chart or the
cycle of six (we will look at that later).

Then maybe we could call this the "cycle of eight." Is there any
evidence in the Gann material for this?.

Get out your "private papers" material and look for the sheet
which has a lot of the soybean prices with zodiacal signs. It starts
with 44.

Note at the bottom he has a circle drawn and by it he has "of 8-
Cycle of Eight."

Then on the sheet where he has marked the average of 6 helio
planets, he has a circle followed by "6 gains 6 (meaning the cycle of
6 gains 6) and under that he has drawn a square and put a 9 beside
it, a check mark or ditto mark, and the number 8. This seems to imply
that the Square of 9 gains 8 as I pointed out earlier.
                                                                        120
So, he seems to be saying that the Square of Nine chart and the
cycle of 8 chart are one and the same thing.



Chapter 7-Triangular Numbers and the Number 9

Doing Gann work is a continuous check for PATTERNS. As I noted
earlier I have spent hundred of hours just foolin' around with
numbers, especially those that seem to have any thing to do with the
Gann work.

Often a check for one PATTERN leads to another.

We have seen that multiplying 8 times a triangular number and
adding 1 established the PATTERN of odd squares.

Does that suggest anything?

I also stated that we can often start at the bottom of the
ladder to find a PATTERN.

In the above chapter heading I noted "the triangular numbers and
the number 9." Can you take it from there?

What if we multiplied 9 times 1 and added 1.

We would get 10.

What if we multiplied 9 times 3 and added 1.

We would get 28.

PATTERN?

There seems to be one. When we multiply a triangular number by 9
and add 1 we get another triangular number.

Let's go up the ladder quite a ways and see if it still works.

9 times 28 plus 1 is 253

And 253 is the triangle of 22.

Most calculators have square root keys and some computer
calculators have cube root and other root keys, but there is none
that I know of which will tell you the root of a triangular number or
any of the other sided-figures.

About the only way is to make up a long list of such numbers.
Hope to have a computer program soon which will do the work.

There is one way to find the root of some (but not all)
triangular numbers. We noted above that 9 times a triangular number
                                                                        121
plus 1 is also a triangular number.

We can reverse that to find some roots. If we suspect a number
is a triangular number, simply subtract 1 and divide by 9 and repeat
the process again until you get to a number that you know is a
triangular number.

Say we suspected that 820 was a triangular number. We would
subtract 1 and divide by 9. The answer would be 91, the triangle of
13 and 820 would be a triangular number since 9 times a triangular
number plus 1 is another triangular number.
Another problem I found was how to determine the root of the
triangle after I had multiplied my original triangular number by 9
and added 1.

But I finally figure it out.

By trial and error I found that 820 was the triangle of 40. But
after some study I found an easier way than trial and error and know
how to do any number.

Want to give it a shot?

We have seen that multiplying 91, the triangle of 13, by 9 and
adding 1 gives us 820 the triangle of 40.

PATTERN?

Let's go to the bottom of that ladder again.

1 is a triangular number.

Nine times 1 is 9. Adding 1 gives us 10, the triangle of 4.

Compare that to 13 and 40.

Got it now?

3x1 is 3 and 3+1 is 4
3x13 is 39 and 39+1 is 40

Why does it work? I suspect it is because 3 is the square root
of 9. It works, but requires a little more study.

There is another way in which the triangular numbers are related
to 8 and 9. Here again I found this through a continuing search for
PATTERNS.

We know that 8x9=72 and that 72 plus 9 equals 81, the square of
9.

Can you take it from there?

We can also say 72x1 plus 9 equals 8l.

                                                                       122
Take it now?

How about 72 times the next triangular number 3 (the triangle of
2).

72x3=216
216+9=225, the square of 15

Got it now?

72 times any triangular number plus 9 equals a square.

Let's try the next triangular number which is 6 (the triangle of
3).

72x6=432
432+9=441, the square of 21

So, it works.

Any other PATTERN?
We saw that the squares made were:

9x9
15x15
21x21

PATTERN now?

Yes, we can see that the difference in the square roots of the
squares is 6.

Can you guess which square would be made if we multiplied 72
times the next triangular number and added 9.

That's right. You would have the square of 27.

The next triangular number after 6 is 10 (the triangle of 4) and
72 times 10 is 720 and when we add 9 we get 729 and from previous
work we know that is the square of 27.

How would the square of 33 be made?

That's right.

We would take 15 (the triangle of 5), multiply it times 72 and
add 9.

As I have said many time, it works every time!



Chapter 8-Triangular Numbers and the Hexagon Chart

On page 113 in the "old course" (Section 10, Master Charts, Hexagon
                                                                      123
Chart, page 4, in the "new course") Gann tells how to make a hexagon
chart. It starts with one in the center and a circle of six numbers is
placed around it. Twelve numbers are added to that, then 18, then
24, etc., gaining six each time.

I'm sure you know by now that here Gann is doing the same thing
as on the Square of Nine chart. On the Square of Nine he put 1 in the
middle, put 8 numbers around that, then 16, etc.

Only here he is putting "circles" of 6's.

PATTERN?

Sure. We can see now that he is including the triangular
numbers.

We can take any triangular number, multiply it by 6 and add 1
and come up with the numbers on the line which he says runs from 1,
7, etc.

Give it a try!

We know from our previous work and from the triangular list, if
you want to look back at it, that 91 is a triangular number. The
triangle of 13. If we multiply by six we get:

6x91=546

and

546+1=547

Now look on the hexagon chart and see where that number is
located.

If we don't add the 1, the numbers run along the line from the
6, his 0 or 360 degree line. There is a good reason for adding the 1,
but that would take us down another path so let's stick to the work
at hand.

I have already pointed out earlier some of the other triangular
numbers Gann mentions in connection with the chart so there is no
reason to repeat them here.

Although Gann has not left us a cycle of 7 or heptegon chart he
does suggest the possibility.

Look at the "private papers" sheet again. The one on which he
has the cycle of 6 and the square of 9 or the cycle of 8.

He notes that 7 is the balance. Of course when we add 8 to 6 and
divide by 2, 7 is the halfway point which he seems to be indicating
here.

So how would we make a cycle of 7 chart without seeing one?
                                                                         124
We would use the same method!

We would start with 1, add 1x7, add 2x7, 3x7, etc.

To find a number on the same line as the 1, we would do the same
as we did with the cycle of 6 and the cycle of 8. Simply take any
triangular number, multiply it by 7 and add 1.

Using 91 again, the triangle of 13, we find:

91x7=637
637+1=638

And 729 ((8x91)+1) plus 547 ((6x91)+1)=1276

1276 divided by 2 is 638

Using the same method we could create any cycle of any number we
care to choose.

Here is an interesting point. You might have checked it out
already.

We know that the cycle of 8 or Square of Nine runs on the line
which contains the odd squares.

Take the numbers which make up the line on the cycle of 6 or
hexagon chart, 1, 7, 19, etc. and check them on the Square of Nine
chart.

You will note that they run counter clockwise, going out one
square and landing each time on a 45-degree angle.

Let's look at another point.

Dividing 8 by 6 we get 1 1/3.

Dividing the triangle of 7 or 28 by the triangle of 6 or 21 is
also 1 1/3.

Therefore when we multiply 21 by 8 and add 1 and when we
multiply 6 times 28 and add 1 we arrive at:

169

And in his comments on the hexagon, Gann notes that 169 or the
square of 13 is important for more reasons than one. We will see
another important reason at a later date.



Chapter 9-Other Clues

I noted earlier that there are many other triangular numbers in
                                                                     125
the Gann material, but that I would let you search for them.

But I will note two just to show that Gann did zero on
triangular numbers without ever mentioning them.

Knowing what you know now, you could probably find one which is
very apparent. The other is extremely well hidden.

Let's look at the one that is very apparent.

Look on page 155 where Gann is discussing soybean prices on the
1 to 33 square chart (the chart that most of us refer to as the
Square of Nine chart).

He notes that the time period is in the 253rd month from Dec.
28, 1932 (January, 1954).

Got it now?

Look on the list I made up of the triangular numbers. You will
find 253 opposite the number 22 so 253 is the triangle of 22. Nowhere
here does Gann say that 253 is a triangular number.

But you and I now know that it is!

Why he chose the triangle of 22, or the time period of 253
months, I'm not sure, but I know it is the number of Robert Gordon,
Gann's fictional character in his novel (The Tunnel Thru the Air).
There are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet and there are 22 chapters
in the Book of Revelations It is also a pyramid number, something we
will look at a little closer at a later date.

We will look at that number, 253, again when we look at the
single digit numbering system and the TELEOIS of the triangle.

Now about that number which is well hidden.

In Book I-"The Cycle of Mars" I came up with the number 133 in
connection with some planetary work.

In Book III-"The Book With No Name," I noted that Gann had
subtracted some parts of the circle from 436. That work was on page 2
of his workout on "Soybeans, Price Resistance Levels."

What was interesting about that paragraph was that all the
figures were natural numbers, except for one, the number 236.25, but
when that number is subtracted from 436 we get the approximate low on
soybeans in February, 1949.

Actually the high on soybeans in 1948 was 436.75, but Gann
rounded off his prices when placing those prices on his Square of
Nine chart, etc. which only shows natural numbers.

When subtracting 236.25 from 436.75 we get 200.5. The actual low
on beans was 201.5.
                                                                        126
In Book III I put down the numbers:
133, 91, 236.25

and asked for a PATTERN.

Can you make it?

(The 133 is from planetary work in connection with the high and
there is no need to explain that here as it was explained in Book I-
"The Cycle of Mars.")

I noted that Gann had divided the circle by 64 so that 360
divided by 64 is 5.625.

So let's add that number to the list:

133, 91, 5.625, 236.25

PATTERN now?

Subtract 91 from 133.

How about now?

133 minus 91 is 42 and 42 times 5.625 is 236.25 and that is the
number Gann subtracted from 436 to get his low!

Look at the Square of Nine chart. Both 133 (the planetary point)
and 91 are on the same angle.

I noted that 91 was a triangular number and TELEOIS and that 91
was 13 times 7. I did not go into details of how to make triangular
numbers as it would have taken me far afield.

After reading this book you can see how far afield it would have
taken me!

But, you ask, why did you use the triangle of 13?

From the high of 436 to the low of 201.5 was 56 weeks, but that
can also be read as 13 months and the triangle of 13 is 91.

As I noted above, this was very well hidden. We will see another
hidden number during that time period at a later date. But for now
that would take us far afield.



Chapter 10-The Double Triangle

Some writers believe that the double triangle of Solomon as
mentioned in Gann's book, "The Tunnel Thru the Air," is two actual
triangles, the apex of one at the top and the apex of the other at
the bottom.
                                                                       127
When a circle is drawn around them the six points of the two
triangles touch the circle so that the circle is divided into 6 parts
of 60 degrees each.

That can be done, but no explanation is given to its meaning. We
can divide a circle into six parts by using the radius of the circle
so that each side of the hexagon equals the radius.

And that's interesting and maybe it has some meaning, but I
can't see any evidence of it in the Gann material, except maybe in
the hexagon itself. But, I believe there is another meaning to the
"double triangle."

There is another mention of the triangular number 666 in the
Bible besides the one in the Book of Revelations. It is found in I
Kings, Chapter 10, Verse 14:

"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred three score and six talents of gold."

A score is 20 so we can add the above and see that it is 666.

Now let's just list a few triangles and their doubles:
                                               Tri Db
                                               1    2
                                               3    6
                                               6    12
                                               10 20
                                               15 30

Do you recognize the numbers in the second row? If you read my
Book IV-"On the Square," you probably do.

They are the geometric means between the successive squares.

They are made by multiplying the square roots of those squares.
For instance, 20 is the geometric mean between the square of 4 (16)
and the square of 5 (25).

We made the geometric mean by simply multiplying the square
roots, in this case 4x5=20.

Remember that we discovered an easy way to find triangular
numbers by simply multiplying the root of the triangle we are trying
to find by the next number and dividing by 2. To get the triangle of
4 we multiply 4 times 5 and divide by 2 to get 10.

PATTERN?

Yes, the double triangles equal the geometric means between the
squares!

If we multiply two successive numbers and divide by 2 we find a
                                                                        128
triangle.

If we multiply two successive numbers and don't divide by 2 we
have found the geometric mean between two successive squares.

Solomon's double triangle of 666 is:

666x2=1332

We know that 666 is the triangle of 36 and we know that we can
find it by multiplying 36 times 37 and dividing by 2. So 1332 must be
36 times 37.

We also know from our work on the squares that 36 times 37
equals the geometric mean between the square of 36 and the square of
37 so that we have the series:

36x36=1296
36x37=1332
37x37=1369

We can prove that 1332 is the geometric mean by multiplying 1296
times 1369. When we take the square root we will have 1332.

I noted earlier that the distance in weeks from the January,
1948 high on beans of 436 to the February, 1949 low at 201.5 was 56
weeks.

That can be read as the geometric mean between the square of 7
and the square of 8 for good reasons, reasons which I will not go
into now.

But I will note that 56 is also 2 times 28 or the double
triangle of 7.



Chapter 11-The Unnatural Triangles

In Book IV-"On the Square" I showed how in addition to natural
squares we could make "unnatural squares" with the sides of the
squares having the same fraction or decimal point. We did it with
addition instead of the usual multiplication.

As I noted earlier, looking for PATTERNS often leads to other
PATTERNS or other discoveries.

While doing some work on the TELEOIS, I came up with the number
12.375.

As the result of that work, which I will not describe here, I
suspected that it might be the triangle of 4.5, a triangle of an
unnatural number, that is, a triangle of a number with a fraction or
decimal point.

                                                                        129
Before I came upon that number, it never dawned om me that
fractional numbers could be triangular as I had worked only with
natural numbers.

But how could it be made? I couldn't simply add .5 to the
triangle of 4. The triangle of 4 is 10 and 10 plus .5 is 10.5 and I
thought the answer must be 12.375.

It should have been obvious. Put this work aside and see if you
can figure it out.

Got the answer already? Yes, you are quicker than I am. As I
noted before I'm a little dense and it takes me several whacks to
figure something out.

Let's see now. We can take 4.5 and multiply it times the next
number and divide by 2. (That's the way we made the triangular
numbers from the natural numbers.)

But what is the next number?

It took a little experimentation until I came across the
obvious.

I multiplied 4.5x5.5 and divided by 2 and got 12.375.

So the "next" number we use is simply 1 added to the number (the
root) for which we are looking for the triangle.

That's really what we did when we were making the triangles from
the natural numbers. The next number was simply 1 plus our original
number.

If we wanted to find the triangle of 5.5 we would multiply it
times 5.5+1 or 6.5 and then divide by 2.

Why would we want to know about the unnatural triangles? As I
noted in Book IV-"On the Square" very little of Gann's material ended
up on natural numbers, squares or otherwise. Most ended in fractions
and the more we know about those fractions, maybe the closer we will
be to the answers about his work.
So let's make a short list of the triangles of numbers which end
with the fraction of one-half or .5. Where do we start from?

From .5 itself.

As in our earlier work the first set of numbers will be the
numbers (roots) for which we are looking to find the triangle and the
second will be the answers.

.5 .375
1.5 1.875
2.5 4.375
3.5 7.875
4.5 12.375
                                                                        130
5.5 17.875
6.5 24.375
7.5 31.875
8.5 40.375
9.5 49.875

Can we prove our work? Are we on the right track?

Do these numbers follow the same PATTERNS as the ones with the
natural numbers? Let's check.

You will recall from our work with the natural numbers that the
triangles were made simply by adding 1 to 2 to 3, etc.

But actually we were adding the "triangle" of 1, which is 1, to
the natural numbers in order.

So here we do not add .5 to 1.5. We add the triangle of .5 to
1.5. So we add:

.375+1.5=1.875

and to 1.875 we add 2.5 and get 4.375.

It works!

Let's give it the acid test by using some other characteristics
of the natural triangles.

You will recall that with the natural triangles we could add the
triangle of one number to the triangle of the next and get the square
of the next:

The triangle of 13 is 91 and the triangle of 14 is 105.

91+105=196 which is the square of 14.

Let's try it with our unnatural numbers.

Using the bottom of the ladder again we add .375 to 1.875 which
is 2.25. Taking the square root we find it is 1.5. So the triangle of
.5 plus the triangle of 1.5 equals the square of 1.5.

PATTERN made!

Let's check some of the other qualities the natural triangles
have.

Remember that we took three successive triangular numbers,
multiplied the two end terms and added the middle term and the answer
was the square of the middle term.
Let's try that.

.375, 1.875, 4.375

                                                                        131
.375x4.375=1.l64065

1.64065+1.875=3.515625

And the square root of 3.515625 is 1.875

PATTERN made!

We also found that we could take any natural triangular number,
multiply it by 8 and add 1 and we would end up with a square,
actually an odd square every time.

So, let's apply that characteristic:

8x.375=3
3+1=4, the square of 2.

PATTERN made and we see that when we multiply 8 times the
triangular number which have one-half as a fraction in its root and
add 1 we end up with the "even" squares.

Try a few and prove it to yourself.

Another characteristic of the natural triangular numbers is that
when we multiply any by 9 and add 1 we get another triangular number.

So, let's try that. Again from the bottom of the ladder.

.375x9=3.373.375+1=4.375

That's the triangle of 2.5

Remember now we could find out what triangle we would be making
with this method. We multiplied the root of the original triangle by
3 and added 1

The root of .375 is .5. And 3x.5 is 1.5 and when we add 1 we get
2.5.

PATTERN made!

Try a few and prove it to yourself.

Even the 72 times a triangular number plus 9 works.

.375x72=27
27+9=36, the square of 6.

1.875x72=135
135+9=144

Note that the square roots of 36 and 144 have a difference of 6.

What do you think the next square will be?

                                                                        132
4.375x72=315
315+9=324, the square of 18.

Try making some triangular numbers with other unnatural numbers
like the triangle of 4.25, 5.25, etc. You would start with the
triangle of .25 if you wanted to make a list and the first would be
.25x1.25=.3125. Then divide by two to get your first triangular
number. Take if from there. Then check with some of the
characteristics found above.



Chapter 12-More Evidence

Can we find some numbers in the Gann material which are
triangles of unnatural numbers?

I have not studied them all and an index of Gann numbers will be
along later, but let's see if we can find at least one.

Let's find the triangle number of 22.5:

22.5x23.5=525.75
525.75 divided by 2=264.375

Let's check another one:

21.5x22.5=483.75
483.75 divided by 2=241.875

Now check your answers in the private papers "Time Periods and
Price Resistance," the table of 1/64th of the circle.



Chapter 13-Gann's Hexagon and the Ancient Hexagon

Gann's hexagon and the hexagon we made, the ancient 6-sided
figure, must not be confused. They are made in two different ways.

The ancient is made by adding numbers which are four units
apart.

Gann's is made by placing 6 around 1 and 12 around that, and 18
around that, etc.

The octagon of the ancients and Gann's cycle of 8 or Square of
Nine (also called an octagon by some writers) should not be confused
either. All the "cycle of" work based on Gann"s method and the
ancient way of making sided figures are two different things.




                                                                       133
Chapter 14-The Triangle of the Zodiac

The study of the triangles presents many interesting
observations about other things.

When you are going through other material you will be able to
spot them a little better.

Case in point in the Time-Life book "Visions and Prophecies" in
the series "Myteries of the Unknown" on page 122 is a discussion of
the tarot cards. It did not surprise me that there were 78 cards in
the tarot deck.

Why 78? That number is the triangle of 12. There are 12 signs of
the zodiac, 12 months in the year, 12 tribes of Israel, etc.

You can form a triangle with them by placing 1 card at the top,
2 under that, etc. The last row will have 12 and the 78 cards will
form a large triangle.

And of course that is why the numbers we have been looking at
are called triangular. Each row or number counts one more than the
one before it.

Check the drawing in the Time-Life Book series, Mysteries of the
Unknown, "Ancient Wisdom and Secret Sects," page 147. Look at the
triangle in the middle and the 10 bars inside of it and notice how
the triangle points to the fourth sign of the zodiac signifying the
number 10.

At the top there are some figures which look like faces and some
points of what appear to be crowns. Count the points and then count
the ribbons that flow from the neck.

I'll let you make the connection. As I said before, why should I
have all the fun.

If I had never learned about triangles, this drawing would have
had no meaning to me at all.

Let's now take the triangle of each of the signs in the zodiac.

                                              1     1
                                              2     3
                                              3     6
                                              4     10
                                              5     15
                                              6     21
                                              7     28
                                              8     36
                                              9     45
                                              10    55
                                                                      134
                                             11    66
                                             12    78

Now add them.

The total is 364 or days in the year as figured in weeks or
7x52.

Coincidence? Maybe. And then again, maybe not.

Since we can make squares by adding any two successive
triangles, let's do that:

1+3=4
6+10=16
15+21=36
28+36=64
45+55=100
66+78=144

PATTERN?

Yes, adding the even squares from the square of 2 through the
square of 12 also equals the year when figured in weeks.



Chapter 15-The Triangles and the Cubes

We have seen the relationship between the triangles and the
squares, but there is also an interesting relationship between the
triangles and the cubes.

In Book V-"The Cycle of Venus," I noted that the heliocentric
cycle of Venus is 225 days and when multiplied by the square of 3 or
9 we get:

3x3x15x15 since 225 is the square of 15.

This can also be read as:

3x15x3x15 or

45x45

which equals 2025.

Now let's put down some cubes:

1x1x1=1
2x2x2=8
3x3x3=27
4x4x4=64
5x5x5=125
                                                                       135
6x6x6=216
7x7x7=343
8x8x8=512
9x9x9=729

Now, let's add our answers and we find that they equal

2025!

PATTERN?

Think hard. Think of the cubes. Think of the square. Think of
the triangles!

Got it now?

The square 45x45 equals the sum of the cubes. And the cubes are
1 through 9.

Got it now?

The triangle of 9 is 45.

How about now?

That's right. The square of any triangular number equals the sum
of the cubes up through the number (root) for which we find triangle.

Example again.

We know from our work that the triangle of 7 is 28. So if we
square 28 which is 28x28=784, then 784 will be the total of all the
cubes from 1 through 7.
Pick out a number, find its triangle, square the triangle and
work out the cubes.

Those familiar with Masonry might know of something called the
cubic stone.

A representation of this cubic stone can be found in A. E.
Waites's book, "A New Encyclopedia of Masonry," Book I, page 405.

You can find numbers around this stone, the cubes of 9, 7, 5, 3
and I believe the cube of 1 is to be understood.

The cubes are:
1x1x1=1
3x3x3=27
5x5x5=125
7x7x7=343
9x9x9=729

When we add them we find that they total 1225.

Look at your triangular number list. You will find 1225 opposite
                                                                        136
the number 49 so 1225 is the triangle of 49.

Note that the cubes we listed are the odd cubes from 1 through
9. The same list as we had before except this time we left out all
the even cubes.

Is it possible that all odd cubes add to a triangular number?

Let's go to the bottom of the ladder again.

1x1x1=1

And the cube of 1 is in the triangle of 1.

1x1x1=1
3x3x3=27

Add them and we find that 28 is indeed a triangular number, the
triangle of 7.

1x1x1=1
3x3x3=27
5x5x5=125

The total is 153 and from our triangular list we know that
number is the triangle of 17.

That should be enough of PATTERN search to tell us we are right.

There is a couple of ways of knowing what triangular number
contains the odd cubes.

Let's look at the cubes above, 1, 3, and 5.

Can you make a PATTERN?

Try this. Add 1 to 5 and get 6 and then multiply 6 by half of 6.
Now can you make it?

That's right. Subtract 1 from 18 and we have our answer.

Now try the ones where we are trying to find the total of the
odd cubes 1 through 9 which we know to be the triangle of 49.

First, add 1 to 9 and get 10. multiply 10 by half of 10 or 5 and
get 50. Now subtract 1 and we will have 49. From our work above we
know that the triangle of 49 is 1225 and 1225 contains all the odd
cubes from 1 through 9.

That's the way for doing it from scratch, but if you know the
triangle of one set of odd cubes, it is easy to know how to get the
next triangle.

Through trial and error I found that the triangle which contains
the odd cubes from 1 through 11 is the triangle of 71.
                                                                      137
PATTERN?

1 through 9 was 49. 71-49=22.

Got it now?

22 is two times 11.

Knowing that the triangle of 71 contains all the odd cubes from
1 through 11, how would we know what number to find the triangle of
which would equal the odd cubes 1 through 13.

That's right. 2x13=26. Add 26 to 71 and get 97. Now if we found
the triangle of 97, it would contain all the odd cubes from 1 through
13. Want to find the triangle which would contain the odd cubes from
1 through 15. Add 30 to 97 and get 127.

Quick now. How would we find the triangular number which would
contain all the odd cubes from 1 through 49?

Right again. Multiply 50 times 25 and subtract 1. Then find the
triangle of your answer and you'll have the right number.

50x25=1250
1250-1=1249

Then 1249x1250 and divide by 2.

We have found the triangular numbers that include the odd cubes
and we have seen how the square of triangular numbers include both
the odd and even cubes.

The search for the even cubes is a little different. It took me
several minutes to figure it out.

Let's look once again at all the cubes contained in the square
of the triangular number 45.

We found that the square of 45 was 2025. We also found that all
the cubes 1 through 9 would be contained in the square.


We know now that the total of the odd cubes from 1 through 9 equal
1225.

That leaves the even cubes, 2, 4, 6 and 8. By subtracting 1225
from 2025 we can find that the even cubes total 800.

PATTERN?

If we added the cube of 10 to the even cubes they would total
1800 since the cube of 10 is 1000.

PATTERN now?
                                                                        138
Let's put down the numbers for both situations:

The cubes of 2, 4, 6, 8 equal 800

The cubes of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 equal 1800

The Masons have something called the double square. Does that
help?

Lets add the cube roots in both situations:

2+4+6+8=20

2+4+6+8+10=30

Got it now?

Let's square 20. 20x20=400

Let's square 30. 30x30=900

How about now?

Double each:

2x400=800
2x900=1800

PATTERN made!

So, to find the total of all the even cubes simply add the cube
roots, square your answer and then double it.

There is an easy way to find the total of the cube roots without
adding them. Simply take half of the largest cube root and multiply
by the next number.

Above we found that 2+4+6+8=20. That can be found by taking half
of 8 and multiplying by the next number (4x5=20). Then find the
square of 20 and double it. For the even cubes up through 10 the
answer would be 5x6=30. Square it and double it.

If we wanted to find the total of the even cubes up through 24,
we would divide 24 by 2 and get 12 and then multiply that by 13. Then
square that answer and double it.

We will see that cubic stone number, 1225, again when we look at
the single digit numbering system and the TELEOIS.



Chapter 16-Triangles and the Cardinal Numbers

The triangular numbers also have a close relationship to the
                                                                        139
cardinal numbers in the cube.

Look at your Square of Nine chart again. Count the numbers
between the heavy lines that make up the cardinal points.

Since this is the square of 33 then there are 33 numbers across
and counting down there are 32 since the one in the middle was
counted when going across, for a total of 65 numbers .

Now imagine that this is not a square but a cube and we are
going to bring in a crane and lift out all the numbers in the
cardinal lines.

Since there are 65 numbers involved and since the numbers are 33
deep then we are removing 33x65 and from our previous work we know
that the answer is a triangular number, the triangle of 65 since one
way of finding triangles is to take half of the next number (66) and
multiply times the original number (65).

That works for any odd cube.

If we wanted to remove the cardinal numbers, the center numbers
or the core, in the cube of 9 we would be removing 9x17 since the
cube is 9 deep and there are 9 numbers across and 8 numbers down.

We know from our work that 9x17=153 or the triangle of 17.

The numbers that remain are also interesting, but I'll let you
play with that. After all why should I be the only one rowing the
boat!

I know you are asking yourself what does all this business about
extracting the cardinal numbers have to do with Gann. As I said
earlier, I believe that we have to explore every avenue in order to
uncover his methods. They are very well hidden in spite of what some
other writers might claim.

We will look at some well hidden relationships among just three
numbers in his soybean chart at a later date.

We will see more of the triangles in the work on the single
digit number system and the TELEOIS of the triangles.

Book VII
The Cycle of Mercury

Chapter 1-The Search For "17"

My interest in the cycle of Mercury, as far as the works of W.
D. Gann is concerned, probably started when I read Gann's novel "The
Tunnel Thru the Air." Especially that part which tells the birthdate
of Robert Gordon, the hero of the novel.

But, to explain why that interested me, I will have to back up a
little.

We all know (most Gann followers anyway) that Gann was a Mason.
So when I got interested in the Gann material I also got interested
in any material on Masonry.

I was able to get my hands on a Masonry book called "Morals and
Dogma" by Albert Pike. He was an Arkansas judge who lived sometime in
the middle or late 1800's.

It was an extremely large book, running close to 900 large
pages. Being new to Masonry I had never seen another Masonry book and
I assumed this was the "main book" of Masonry. I have since learned
that there are many other Masonry books, but Pike's book seems to be
one of those held in highest regard by Masons.

The book is full of philosophy, but there are some parts on
numbers (some of which we will look at another time) and some parts
deal with mythology, etc.

Pike tells the story of Osiris and Isis, the mythological gods
of Egypt. You might have heard of these two if you have read books on
ancient history, etc. They were mentioned in a l995 program on the
A&E Cable TV channel about the pyramids.

Let's have a look at that story as related by Pike beginning on
page 375 (Note: The punctuation in this quote follows that in the
book and is not necessarily the way a writer would punctuate today):

"Osiris, said to have been an ancient King of Egypt, was the
Sun; and Isis, his wife, the Moon: and his history recounts, in
poetical and figurative style, the annual journey of the Great
Luminary of Heaven through the diffeent Signs of the Zodiac.

"In the absence of Osiris, Typhon, his brother, filled with envy
and malice, sought to usurp his throne; but his plans were frustrated
by Isis. Then he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did, by persuading
                                                                        141
him to enter a coffin or sarcophagus, which he then flung into the
Nile.

"After a long search, Isis found the body, and concealed it in
the depths of a forest; but Typhon, finding it there, cut it into
fourteen pieces, and scatterd them hither and thither. After tedious
search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes having eaten the other
(the privates), which she replaced of wood, and buried the body at
Philae; where a temple of surpassing mangificence was erected in
honor of Osiris.

"Isis, aided by her son Orus, Horus or Har-oeri, warred against
Typhon, slew him, reigned gloriously, and at her death was reunited
to her husband, in the same tomb...

"In the legend of Osiris and Isis, as given by Plutarch, are
many details and circumstances other than those that we have briefly
mentioned; and all of which we need not repeat here. Osiris married
his sister Isis; and labored publicly with her to ameliorate the lot
of men. He taught them agriculture, while Isis invented laws. He
built temples to the Gods, and established their worship. Both were
the patrons of artists and their useful inventions; and introduced
the use of iron for defensive weapons and implements of agriculture,
and of gold to adorn the temples of the gods. He went forth with an
army to conquer men to civiliztion, teaching the people whom he
overcame to plant the vine and sow grain for food.

"Typhon, his brother, slew him when the sun was in the sign of
the Scorpion, that is to say, at the Autumnal Equinox. They had been
rival claimants, says Synesius, for the throne of Egypt, as Light and
Darkness contend ever for the empire of the world. Plutarch adds,
that at the time when Osiris was slain, the moon was at its full; and
therefore it was in the sign opposit the Scorpion, that is, the Bull,
the sign of the Vernal Equinox."

Then on page 589:

"Osiris is a being analogous to the Syrian Adoni; and the fable
of his history, which we need not here repeat, is a narrative form of
the popular religion of Egypt, of which the Sun is the Hero, and the
agricultural calendar the moral. The moist valley of the Nile, owing
its fertility to the annual inundation appreared, in contrast with
the surrounding desert, like life in the midst of death.

"The inundation was in evident dependent on the Sun, and Egypt,
enviorned with arid deserts, like a heart within a burning censer,
was the the female power, dependent on the influences personified in
its God. Typhon his brother, the type of darkness, drought, and
sterility, threw his body into the Nile; and thus Osiris, the "good,"
the "Saviour," perished, in the 28th year of his life or reign, and
on the 17th day of the month Athor, or the 13th of November.

"He is also made to die during the heats of the early Summer,
when, from March to July, the earth was parched with intolerable
heat, vegetation was scorched, and the languid Nile exhausted. From
                                                                        142
that death he rises when the Solstitial Sun brings the inundation and
Egypt is filled with mirth and acclamation anticipatory of the second
harvest. From his Wintry death he rises with the early flower of
Spring, and then the joyful festival of Osiris found was celebrated."


Chapter 2-Preces s ion of the Equinoxes

Let's look back at Chapter 1 again. We read there that Osiris
was slain at the Autumnal Equinox.

Then we read that he was slain on the "17th" day of Athor or the
13th of November.

I imagine that Athor was an Egyptian month which was November in
the calendars of some other countries. And because of differences in
calendars the 17th day of Athor in the Egyptian calendar was the l3th
of November in other calendars.

But let's stick with the "17th" day of Athor since that is the
number which caught my eye.

We also saw that the Autumnal Equinox was in Scorpio. For those
that may not have much knowledge of astronomy or astrology some
explanation is in order. I an neither an astronomer or astrologer,
but have read some books on each. I would suggest that anyone
pursuing a Gann study should read a little in these two fields.

Many of you may already know about the precession of the
equinoxes and those that don't know can find an explanation in most
encyclopedias under the topic "Precession of the Equinoxes."

But for those who don't care to do that search I will offer a
brief explanation here.

When the sun crosses the equator each spring going north (I know
the sun doesn't really move across the equator, but the path of the
earth around the sun makes it seem to do so) we call that the vernal
equinox. We are told that the sun's position in the sky against the
background of the zodiac is entering the first point of Aires or OO
AIRES.

When it goes back south and crosses the equator in the fall,
about Sept. 22 we are told that the sun is in the first point of
Libra or OO LIBRA (the symbol of which is a balance since it balances
night and day).

But both of these positions are incorrect!

Astronomers will tell you that the sun at the Vernal Equinox is
somewhere in Pices and headed toward Aquarius. (Remember the song in
the late 1960's about the age of Aquarius?)

The use of the first point of Aires and Libra for the equinoxes
is a pretty much modern day convenience we now use instead of using
                                                                        143
the places where the sun really is on the first day of spring and the
first day of autumn.

The idea that the sun is in the first points of Aires and Libra
at the equinoxes is a matter of convenience. We use that convenience
because the sun at the equinoxes is slowly moving "backwards" in the
zodiac. Thus the term "precession of the equinoxes."

The sun is slowly moving "backwards" through the zodiac because
it does not come back to the same place in the sky each year because
of the wobble of the earth. (Here again I'm saying that the sun does
not come back to the same place in the sky, when actually it is the
earth, but because the earth does not come back to the same place our
view of the sun makes it appear not to come back to the same place.)

There is about 50 seconds of arc difference each year.
("Seconds" here is in terms of degrees and not time. There are 360
degrees in a circle. There are 60 minutes in each degree and there
are 60 seconds in each minute of those degrees) It takes over 2,000
years for the sun to "precess" or go "backward" through a sign. So a
couple of thousand years ago the sun really was at the first point of
Aires at the equinox and a couple of thousand years earlier than that
the sun was in Taurus at the Vernal Equinox. And when it was in
Taurus at the vernal equinox it was in Scorpio (the opposite sign) at
the Autumnal Equinox.

There are some computer programs available which show the
position of the sun, moon, planets, stars, etc. for any day of the
year. I have a registered program called "Skyglobe."

With it you can run the time forward or backwards. Run it
backwards 100 years at a time and you can see the sun move forward in
the zodiac at the equinoxes and run it forward and you can see the
sun moving backwards in the zodiac at the equinoxes.

So at the time this story of Osiris was told, the Autumnal
equinox was in Scorpio. The equinox evidently was on the l7th day of
the month Athor. Whether it was in the l7th degree of Scorpio is not
indicated in the story.

But, suffice it to say that I was intrigued by the number
l7.



Chapter 3--Robert Gordon's Birthday

The number l7 popped up again when I read Gann's novel "The
Tunnel Thru the Air."

When I checked the birthday of Gann's main character, Robert
Gordon, which was on June 9, 1906, I found that the sun and Mercury
were in conjunction at the "l7th" degree of Gemini. There was that
number l7 again.

                                                                        144
Then to add to this intriguing bit of information I heard a line
in a movie. It was an old John Wayne movie on television. One of his
early westerns. During a shootout Gabby Hayes said to John Wayne,
"They can't kill me until the l7th day of the month because I'm a
Gemini."

Then years later in another John Wayne movie on TV, "The Wings
of Eagles," the character played by Dan Dailey said, "They can't kill
me until the l7th day of the month because I'm a Gemini."

Don't know if this was some kind of inside joke in two John
Wayne movies or if this has an astrological significance. Some of you
more versed in astrology than I am might know the answer.

All I can say is that it peaked my interest in the number 17.

There are a couple of other things about the number l7 that
interests me and maybe you too.

If you take a 12x12 square and figure the diagonal you will be
close to l7. To find the diagonal or hypotenuse of a right angle
triangle we use the old Pythagoran method. We square each side, add
the answers and take the square root. So we square 12 and get 144 and
square 12 again and get 144 and add them and get 288. The we take the
square root of 288 and get 16.970562. Close to l7. Actually 288 is
one unit shy of 289 which is the square of l7.

In the Ohio Archaeologist of April 1987 James A. Marshall tells
in his "An Atlas of American Indian Geometry" that many Indian mounds
are constructed with 187 feet on each side.

We can also read 187 as 11x17. E1even would be the side of the
great pyramid if it was built to a scale model (that's something we
will look at in its proper place.)

If we reduced the sides of those Indian mounds to inches we
would have 12x11x17 or l32x17. I mentioned in Book I-"The Cycle of
Mars" that the number 132 would crop up in an interesting way in a
discussion of "The Tunnel Through the Air." We will look at that
number later in this book.

So we find that Robert Gordon was born when the Sun and Mercury
were in the 17th degree of Gemini.

If we reduce that point in the Zodiac to its place on a 360
degree zodiac wheel we find that it is 77. There are 30 degrees in
Aires and 30 in Taurus making 60 and l7 degrees in the next sign
which is Gemini gives us 77.

There is a special relationship between those two numbers. 17
and 77, which is not found anywhere else on the Zodiac wheel, so put
on your PATTERN cap and see if you can figure what it is. The answer
will be given in the last chapter of this book. No don't peek! Give

                                                                        145
it a good try before you look at the answer. I will give you a hint.
Think triangles and squares.



Chapter 4--Looking for 132

In going through "The Tunnel Thru The Air" we come to that
section in which Gann tells about the flight of Charles Lindberg from
New York to Paris.

I was curious to see if the date of Lindberg leaving New York
coincided in any way with the birth of Robert Gordon. I found that
both incidents occurred when the Sun and Mercury were in conjunction.

I was also curious about how many conjunctions Mercury had made
with the Sun between the two events. Before I worked it out I had a
suspicion what it would be. Why it should be that way, I didn't know.
I just had a feeling what it was.

So, let's list the conjunctions and see what we can find. We
will list the number of the conjunction, the date, the degree and the
sign. So starting with Robert Gordon's birthday on June 9, 1906 when
the sun and the Mercury were in conjunction we will list conjunctions

When I started doing this workout several years ago I had a
sneaking suspicion that there would be 132 conjunctions from Gordon's
birth to the flight of Charles Lindberg.

Why I had that suspicion, I don't know. Maybe it was because the
                                                                        148
conjunction of Jupiter and Mars was at 132 when the price of soybeans
made 436 in l948 as I explained in Book I-"The Cycle of Mars."

Maybe it is all just coincidental, but I find a lot of
coincidences in the Gann material that might not be coincidental at
all.



Chapter 5--Mercury and the Square of 7

Gann speaks a number of times about the number 7 and also
mentions the square of 7 or 49 and even the cube of 7 or 343.

At first glance the cycle of Mercury would seem to have little
to do with the number 7.

In the previous chapters I have talked about the conjunctions of
the sun with Mercury and that was from the geocentric view or seeing
the sun and Mercury from our point of view on the earth.

But the planets also have what is known as heliocentric
positions. This is the view of the planets as seen from the sun.

The time for the planet Mercury to go around the sun is
approximately 88 days. And that would seem to have little to do with
the number 7, its square, or its cube.

But let's see if we can find something that might fit into a
PATTERN.

Several years ago I took each of the planets heliocentric cycles
and divided them into each other.

The ones that caught my eye were the cycles of Jupiter and the
cycles of Mercury.

The heliocentric cycle of Jupiter (the time it takes to make one
complete revolution around the sun) is approximately 11.88 years.
(Some believe this is the basis of Gann's square of 12 since this is
approximately 12 years and there are 12 months in each year.)

Let's multiply to find the number of days in this 11.88 years
cycle.

11.88 times 365.2422 is 4339.0773 days.

We noted earlier that the heliocentric cycle of Mercury is
approximately 88 days.

If we divide 88 days into 4339.0773 days we get:

49.307696!

In other words we find that there are 49 cycles of Mercury in
                                                                        149
one cycle of Jupiter. Or we can say when Jupiter makes one cycle
around the sun, Mercury makes 49 cycles.

Well, that gives us the square of 7, you say, but what about the
cube of 7?

Gann mentions the numbers 83 and 84 and some writers have picked
up on these numbers as referring to the same thing, the cycle of
Uranus which is about 84 years.

But there is another reason for the number 83.

It concerns the "directional" movement of Jupiter.
I have read only a few books on astrology as they seem to pretty
much say the same things. But I had never heard of "directional"
movement until I picked up a book written in the last century.

In the book "directional" movement is never really explained but
by following the examples, it can be figured out.

"Directional movement" is when the sun and a planet come back to
their same positions as they had at a previous time.

For example, the sun and Jupiter have a conjunction at some
degree and some sign in the zodiac. Their "directional movement" is
the time it takes to come back to a conjunction in that same degree
and sign.

As for the sun and Jupiter, their directional movement is 83
years.

Let's check the ephemeris. We can see that on June 10, 1906, one
day after the birth of Robert Gordon, the sun was in the 18th degree
of Gemini and so was the planet Jupiter. Then checking 83 years later
we find that on June 9, 1989 the sun and Jupiter are once again in
the 18th degree of Gemini.

But what does this have to do with Mercury and the cube of 7,
you might ask.

If we check those 83 years you will find that those years
contain 7 cycles of Jupiter. Since there are 49 cycles of Mercury in
one cycle of Jupiter there must be 7 times 49 or the cube of 7 cycles
of Mercury in those 83 years.

Let's check it.

83 times 365.2422 equals 30315.102 days.

30315.102 divided by 88 equals 344.48979.

Ok. So, it's not an exact cube. When we divided the cycle of
Mercury into one cycle of Jupiter, we got a little over 49 cycles. So
that difference is also reflected here.

                                                                        150
The cube of 7 is 343. Rather close, don't you think?



Chapter 6--Mercury and the Number 33

I imagine that many Gann readers are intrigued as I am with the
number 33. That's because one of the Gann charts (an extension of the
Square of Nine) is the square of 33 chart.

Also, Gann was a Mason and there are 33 degrees in Masonry.
There are also other reasons for 33 but since this is a book on
Mercury, let's look at the number in that light.

First, let us extend that list of Sun-Mercury conjunctions that
we had in Chapter 4.

As you can see we are back where we started. True, it is off one
day and one degree, but it is awfully close.

And when we check the dates we can see that it is 33 years.

If we checked dates after our June 8, 1939 date we would find
similar results. Let's look at a few dates that are 33 years apart.
This time I will leave off the zodiac material.

June 9, 1906 June 8, 1939
Aug. 13, 1906 Aug. ll, 1939
Sept. 25, 1906 Sept. 23, 1939
Dec. 1, l906 Nov. 29, l939

I think that is enough to give you the idea.

In looking over a list of Sun-Mercury conjunction dates it
sometimes appears there are other cycles such as a four-year cycle,
but the four-year cycle doesn't stay in sync.

Let's look at some dates that I did not list earlier.

1902 1906
Aug. 12 (18) Leo Aug. 13 (19) Leo

That's a four-year period and it would seem that there is a
four-year cycle. But now let's put down those two dates again and
under those put the dates of the next conjunctions for both years.

1902 1906
Aug. 12 (18) Leo Aug. 13 (19) Leo
Oct 20 (25) Libra Sept. 25 (01) Libra

So, we had a pretty good match between the August dates of 1902
and 1906, but between the October and September dates of 1902 and
1906, it misses by 25 days.
What's going on here?

The problem is that in one August date the conjunction was made
when Mercury was going direct and in the other August date the
conjunction was made when Mercury was in retrograde (appears to move
backward in the zodiac).

So we were trying to compare apples with oranges and it didn't
work out. So now, to our samples above, lets put D for direct and R
for retrograde.

1902 1906
                                                                       155
Aug. 12 (18) Leo (D) Aug. 13 (19) Leo (R)
Oct 20 (25) Libra (R) Sept. 25 (01) Libra (D)

Now let's look at those few dates again that were 33 years
apart. And now I will indicate whether the conjunctions were made
while Mercury was going direct (D) or retrograde (R).

June 9, 1906 (D) June 8, 1939 (D)
Aug. 13, 1906 (R) Aug. ll, 1939 (R)
Sept. 25, 1906 (D) Sept. 23, 1939 (D)
Dec. 1, l906 (R) Nov. 29, l939 (R)

Now we can see that in the 33 year cycles we are no longer
comparing apples to oranges. A direct conjunction compares to another
direct conjunction 33 years later and a retrograde conjunction
compares to another retrograde conjunction 33 years later.



Chapter 7--Another 33-Year Cycle

While we are on the subject of 33-year cycles we might as well
look at another one. The 33-year cycle of the moon.

You may have heard of the 19 year cycle of the moon (which could
be the basis of Gann's 19x19 square) and some other moon cycles, but
have you ever heard of the 33-year cycle?

This is the cycle of the moon going "backwards" through the
seasons.

Since one lunation (conjunction of the moon and sun) is just
over 29.5 days, 12 of those lunations are about 11 days short of the
solar year. If we use the "12th" moon for marking off our years, it
will take 33 years for the calculations to be right. That is, it will
take 33 years for the moon to come back to the same day of the year.

Let's look at the month in which Robert Gordon was born. It is
June, 1906. The new moon in that month was on June 21 at 29 degrees
in Gemini.

Now let's count 12 new moons from that date.

And we end up at June 10, 1907. Then lets put down the dates for
the next 12 moons, the next 12, etc. And let's list the dates for
when the "12th moon" occurs.

May 30, 1908
May 19, 1909
May 9, l910
April 28, 1911
April 17, 1912
April 6, 1913
March 26, 1914

                                                                        156

Jan. 9, 1921
Dec, 29, 1921
Dec. 18, 1922
Dec. 8, 1923
Nov. 26, 1924
Nov. 16, 1925

Sept. 22, 1930
Sept. 12, 1931
Aug. 31, 1932
Aug. 21, 1933
Aug. 10, 1934
July 30, 1935
July 18, 1936
July 8, 1937
June 27, 1938
June 17, 1939

So now we have gone backwards through the seasons, not coming
out on the exact date, but you can see the idea. The 12th moon
arrives approximately 11 days earlier each cycle.

We can see why going backwards through the seasons takes
approximately 33 years. Since the cycle of 12 moons is approximately
11 days short of the solar year we can multiply 11 times 33 and get
363 which is approximately one solar year.



Chapter 8--Mercury and the Great Pyramid

Do you know what the measurements of the Great Pyramid are or
what those measurements represent?

There have been several television shows in the past few years
on the pyramids and speculation on their construction.

In the late 1800's a man by the name of Flanders Petrie did a
detailed measurement of the Great Pyramid.

Although the capstone has long been gone (or maybe it was never
there in the first place) Petrie determined that the intended height
of the Great Pyramid was 5813 inches.

If we use the height of the pyramid as the radius of a circle we
find that the circumference of the circle is:

                                                                       157
5813 times 2 times Pi (3.14159)=36524.125

If we divide 36524.125 by 100 we get 365.24125

We can see that the last figure above is very close to the
number of days in a solar year which is approximately 365.2422 (not
the 365.25 that we were taught in school to account for the extra day
added every four years. We use 365 for three years and add the extra
day every four years to make up the quarter, but astronomy books give
the figure as being closer to 365.2422).

So if we use one inch to represent one day, the circumference we
arrived at represents 100 years.

(I have mentioned the Time-Life series of books "Mysteries of
the Unknown" several times in my books on Gann. In one of those
books, "Mystic Places" on page 59 it says the measurements represent
1,000 years, but that is a mistake in their book. Yes, there are
mistakes in those books. I have found others and I'm sure there are
some that I missed). Time-Life, Gann, myself, etc. We all make
mistakes.

When the sides of the base of pyramid were measured Petrie found
that they also equaled 36524.125. Therefore the base of the pyramid
in terms of its height represented the squaring of the circle, as far
as perimeter is concerned.

I say "as far as perimeter is concerned" since there are at
least three schools of thought on the "squaring of the circle." The
other two examples are not needed as far as the discussion at hand is
concerned.

Many years ago I saw the movie "No Highway in the Sky" with
James Stewart. In the first part of the movie he is shown with his
daughter who mentions studying the pyramid at school and the
"squaring of the circle." That movie is shown from time to time on
television. American Movie Classics has shown it several times. You
might be interested in taking a look at it.

We could make a scale model of the pyramid using a height of 7
inches.
In ancient times the use of fractional numbers were difficult
and Pi was expressed as 22/7. The Hebrews used 21/7 or 3 as can be
seen in the Bible.

In I Kings, Chapter 7, verse 23, a passage about the building of
Solomon's house, we have these words:

"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a
line of 30 cubits did compass it round about."

From this we gather that the molten sea was circular with a
diameter of 10 cubits and a circumference of 30, so the ratio of
diameter to circumference was 3.
                                                                        158
But the Egyptians seemed to use 22/7 as the ratio of diamter to
circumference so using 22/7 for our Pi and 7 inches for our radius of
a circle we would get a circumference of:

7 times 2 times 22/7=44

The base of our model pyramid would also be 44 and the sides
would therefore be 11.

(I noted in some of my other work that the number 44 was more
than just the cash low on soybeans in 1932. I noted that it was also
a pyramid number. So now you can see that from this discussion.)

The triangle of 11 is 66. (Triangular numbers were discussed in
Book IV of this series.)

(Gann said we have angles of 66, 67 and 68).

If we divide the height of the Great Pyramid by 66 we get:

88.075757, the approximate time it takes Mercury to go around
the sun.

Coincidental?

Maybe.

But remember that the pyramid represents 100 solar years. So
maybe the planet Mercury was represented by these calculations.



Chapter 9-The Ans wer

I noted something in Chapter 3. I asked you to try to figure it
out before turning to this chapter for the answer. Did you figure it
out?

The birth of Robert Gordon was in the "17th" degree of Gemini.
If we reduce that degree to its absolute number in the zodiac we find
it is 77. There are 30 degrees in Aires, 30 in Taurus and we have 17
in Gemini, for a total of 77.

I noted there was an interesting relationship between these two
numbers, 17 and 77. I asked for you to think triangle and square.

The triangle of 17 is 153.

Do you have it now?

Remember that the natural squares are made by adding the natural
odd numbers in order.

Got it now?
                                                                        159
In my Book IV-"On the Square" I noted that we could find what
square was being completed with any odd number by simply adding 1 to
the odd number and dividing by 2.

So if we add 1 to 153 we get 154 and 154 divided by 2 is 77!

In other words, if we add 153 to 76x76 we get 77x77. So there is
the interesting relationship between 17 and 77.

Is this just another coincidence in the Gann material or another
clue to his methods?



Chapter 10--Gann's Use of "17"

I have shown you how the number 17 is possibly pointed at by
Gann in his novel, "The Tunnel Thru the Air."

Is there any other evidence of the use of the number l7 in his
other material?

I believe there is.

The number appears quite a bit in some of his astrological work,
which you should check.

But just to show you at least one of those pieces of
astrological material, I have included a sheet from his "private
papers." I think it speaks for itself.

Study carefully the enclosed graphic below.




                                                                       160

Book VIII
The Single Digit Numbering System

Chapter 1-Figuring in Bed in My Head

One night as I was in bed I wanted to know where I would end up
on the Square of Nine chart if I went out one square and up to the
next 22.5 degree line, out another square and up to the next 22.5
degree angle, etc. and on around until I came back to the line which
contains the odd squares, the 315 degree line.

In a few minutes I knew the answer. The next morning I checked
it out on my calculator and I was right!

How did I accomplish that mental feat?

I did it through the use of the single digit numbering system I
had worked out over the years. And after studying this book you will
be able to do the same thing! If you cannot, I will show you how at
the end of this book.

Why should we be interested in a single digit numbering system?
Gann seems to have used it, at least to some extent. We find that on
page 112 of the "old" commodity course (Section 10, Master Charts,
Square of Nine, page 2 in the "new" course) he says that you cannot go
beyond nine without starting over.

I have read a few numerology books and as a student of Gann you
probably have too. What they all have in common is the fact all
numbers are reduced to single digits. That is accomplished by adding
the numbers until you end up with a single digit.

For example we could use the number 1089 which you probably
recognize from the Square of Nine chart as being the square of 33. We
would add the numbers like this:

1+0+9+9=18

Then we would reduce the 18:

1+8=9

Let's look at the first 33 numbers in our natural numbering
system. As explained in Book IV-"On the Square" in my series "The
PATTERNS of Gann" the "natural" numbers are numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.
That is, numbers that nave no fractional part.

We will list the numbers in the first column and in the second
                                                                         162
we will reduce them to a single digit. Of course the first nine will
be the same since they are already single digits:

1=1
2=2
3=3
4=4
5=5
6=6
7=7
8=8
9=9
10=1
11=2
12=3
13=4
14=5
15=6
16=7
17=8
18=9
19=1
20=2
21=3
22=4
23=5
24=6
25=7
26=8
27=9
28=1
29=2
30=3
31=4
32=5
33=6

As you can see every time we get to 9 the next number is 1 and
we start the series all over again.

In my preface and in my previous books I have emphasized that
the reader should always be on the lookout for PATTERNS.

As we work through this book I will often ask you to look for
the PATTERN as the search for the answers to Gann is the search for
PATTERNS.

As we saw above, the PATTERN was very straight forward. We went
from 1 through 9 and started over again. But you will see that we
cannot go beyond nine without repeating the PATTERN even when the
PATTERN is not as straight forward.

We can see that when we look at the squares. This time instead
of looking at the first 33 natural numbers we will look at the first
33 squares made up of those natural numbers.
                                                                       163
First we will list the square roots of the square, then the
squares themselves and in the third column we will express the
squares with their single digit values (SDV).

1x1=1=1
2x2=4=4
3x3=9=9
4x4=16=7
5x5=25=7
6x6=36=9
7x7=49=4
8x8=64=1
9x9=81=9
10x10=100=1
11x11=121=4
12x12=144=9
13x13=169=7
14x14=196=7
15x15=225=9
16x16=256=4
17x17=289=1
18x18=324=9
19x19=361=1
20x20=400=4
21x21=441=9
22x22=484=7
23x23=529=7
24x24=576=9
25x25=625=4
26x26=676=1
27x27=729=9
28x28=784=1
29x29=841=4
30x30=900=9
31x31=961=7
32x32=1024=7
33x33=1089=9

PATTERN?

No, it doesn't make the nice 1, 2, 3, 4, PATTERN that we saw
with the natural numbers in order. But, there is a PATTERN.

We can see that the first nine squares reduce to the single
digits 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9.

The squares 10 through 18 also reduce to the single digits 1, 4,
9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9.

Now check the next 9 squares and you will see that the squares
reduce to the same single digits, proving what Gann said. You can
never go beyond nine without starting over again.

Specifically you cannot go beyond the 9th "term" in a number
                                                                    164
series which grows by the same increments each time. For example, the
squares are made up of the odd series of numbers which grow by
increments of two each time.

That not only works for squares but also for the other figures I
discussed in my book Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers."

The beauty about the single digit system of numbers is that you
can do some mental calculations and get answers without picking up a
calculator. I have worked out some complicated Gann problems while
driving my car.

Is 9,776 a triangular number?

Give it a try. I'll give you the answer at the end of this book.

Before we do some calculating let's have a look at the Square of
Nine chart and see if we can discover some PATTERNS with our
knowledge of the single digit numbering system.

Before reading further, look at your chart and give it a try and
then come back to this material.




Chapter 2-The Nine as Zero

By the time you finish this you will be able to look at the
Square of Nine chart and find the PATTERNS as I suggested above.

We will start by playing a game. Games are fun and learning by
games is a very easy way to learn!

Write down the year in which you were born, add your age,
subtract your weight, add 3 for each pizza you ate this week,
subtract 7 for each time you went to church or synagogue this week,
add 13 if your favorite color is red, add 17 if it is blue, add 33 if
it is green.

Now multiply your answer by 45. Sum your answer to a single
digit in the same way that some writers summed the stock market top
in October, 1987 when the top was 2722. it was summed as 2+7+2+2=13.
That's the way they left it and added their own reasons for doing so.

But let's finish the job as Gann would have done, 1+3=4. So make
your answer a single digit, please.

I can guess your answer. It is 9!

If your answer does not agree with mine, then check it again as
you made a mistake. I didn't. As Walter Brennan said in the "Guns of
Will Sonnet," that's not brag, just fact.

Want to play again? Might as well. Ok. Go through the same
                                                                        165
routine, only this time multiply your answer by 18 instead of 45.

Again, I can guess your answer. It is still 9!

And again if your answer does not agree with mine, check it
again. You made a mistake somewhere.

A parlor game? Somewhat. But much more useful than might at
first be realized.

In similar parlor games you are usually asked to start with a
single number. Then it is multiplied and divided in certain ways,
according to some mathematical formula, so that the operator knows
the answer, much in the same way that the magician David Copperfield,
guesses which car you are in on a train in his TV shows.

But look at the variables above. I have no way of knowing your
age, how many pizzas you had, etc.

But I do have the knowledge of 45 and 18, the two things I did
have control over. And therein lies the key!

THE NINE AS ZERO

What do I mean by the "nine as zero?"

Let's look at that high on the Dow again. We added the digits
2722 or 2+7+2+2 and got 13 and reduced again we find that 1+3=4.
Let's move up to 2731 and reduce that figure to a single digit.
2+7+3+1=13 and 1+3=4. The same answer we had for 2722. Now let's move
down to 2713 and reduce that number to a single digit:
2+7+1+3=13 and 1+3=4. Again the answer is the same. let's play
an old Gann trick and add 360 to 2722 and get 3092 and reduce that to
a single digit:

3+0+8+2=13 and 1+3=4, same answer.

Now let's subtract 360 from 2722, ala Gann and get 2362 and
reduce that to a single digit:

2+3+6+2=13 and 1+3=4.

PATTERN?

Note than in the first example I moved up 9 points to 2731 and
in the second I moved down 9 points to 2713 and got the same answer.

Why? As I stated above the key is "nine as zero."

I had been studying the single digit numbering system for a
number of years before I discovered the concept of "nine as zero."
Why did the nine act as it did?

When the answer finally came to me it was all quite simple.

                                                                        166
The 9 in the single digit system works (has the same qualities)
as the 0 in our regular numbering system.

Another way to put it: the 9 has the same value in the single
digit numbering (SDN) system as the zero has in the regular numbering
system.

Let's look at the function of zero in addition and subtraction
in our usual base 10 system of numbers. We can take a number like 33
and add a zero to it and end up with 33 as the answer. Likewise we
can subtract zero from 33 and the answer will still be 33. So what
have we learned?

We have learned that adding or subtracting a zero in our usual
numbering system does not change the value of the number to which it
was added or subtracted. No matter how many zeroes we add to 33 we
will still get the number 33. Likewise with the subtraction.


Let's now change 33 to a single digit value (SDV). So 3 plus 3
is 6. If we add 9 to 33 we get 42 which also has an SDV of 6. If we
subtract 9 from 33 we get 24 which also has an SDV of 6.

It does not matter how many 9's we add or subtract we will still
get 6. 27 is three 9's and 33 minus 27 is 6. 27 plus 33 is 60 and 60
has an SDV of 6.

We have now seen that adding or subtracting 9 or multiples of 9
from a number does not change its SDV. So in adding or subtracting, 9
has the same characteristics in the SDV system as zero had in the
regular counting system.

Neither changed the value of the original number!.

When I added 9 to 2722 and got 2731, it did not change the
single digit value as the value of 2722 was 4 and 2731 was 4. Ditto
when I subtracted 9 from 2722 and got 2713.

Also when I added 360 ala Gann and subtracted 360 like Gann the
answer was still 4 since adding or subtracting 360 was the same as
adding or subtracting 40 9's as 40 times 9 is 360.
On page 153 of the course in which he is discussing the 15-day,
24-hour chart Gann subtracts 360 from 436 and gets 76. If you reduce
both numbers to 13 and then to single digit value you will find that
the answer in both cases is 4.

Gann's use of the square of 144 served the same purpose. 144 is
a multiple of 9 or 9x16=144.

Take the number 436 again. Keep subtracting 144 until you can't
any longer and you will again have 4. 3x144 is 432 and 436-432 is 4.

You can see the same results when Gann used the square of 90 as
90 is 9x10 and adding it or subtracting it from a number will not
change its SDV.
                                                                        167
With that in mind go back to our little game and figure out how
I came up with the answer. Hint: think multiplication.

Got it?

As I stated earlier, I had no control over your variables, but I
did have control over the multipliers, 45 and 18.

Let's look at the role of the zero in our usual numbering system
when it comes to multiplication.

Using the number 33 again, let's multiply it by zero and we get
zero since we all know that zero times any number is zero. When we
added or subtracted zero we did not change the value of the number,
the number was still 33. But when we multiply 33 times zero, we do
change the value and that value is zero itself.

Using 33 again let's multiply by 9 and get 297. Let's now reduce
to a single digit, 2+9+7=18 and reducing further 1+8=9. We could have
reduced 33 to its single digit value 3+3=6 and then multiplying by 9
to get 54 and then reduce that, 5+4=9.

PATTERN?

Got it?

When we multiply by 9 and reduce to a single digit we will
always get 9. Nine changes the single digit value to itself as the
zero changed the value in our usual numbering system to itself.

As noted above you can multiply a number by 9 and then reduce to
a single digit or reduce the number to a single digit first and then
multiply by 9. The answer will always be 9.

And that's how I knew your answer would be 9.

"Hold on. Wait a minute," you say. "You didn't multiply by 9.
You multiplied by 45 and 18."

That's right and the reason is that they are both multiples of
9!

When I asked you to multiply by 45, in essence you were also
multiplying your answer by 5 and then by 9 and in the case of the 18
you were really multiplying your answer by 2 and then by 9. If I had
told you to multiply by 9 you would have seen the scheme right away
and I would not have had this chance to give you a lesson in looking
for PATTERNS.
By the way, when I told you to check your answer if it did not
agree with mine and told you if there was a mistake it was yours and
not mine, it was not brag, just fact. It always has to be 9.

So let's say it again:

                                                                        168
In the single digit numbering system, adding or subtracting a 9
or multiples of 9 will not change the value of the original number.

In the single digit numbering system, multiplying by 9 or
multiples of 9 will always change the value of the original number
and that value will always be 9.



Chapter 3-A Recap So Far

Let's do a recap so we can get the idea firmly in mind. Again we
will use the number 33 since Gann students seem to like it so well
(Gann's Square of 33, the 33 degrees of Masonry, one of the "master
numbers," etc.) This time we will use multiples of zero and 9.

Let's make the multiple 5.

First will be addition:

33+0+0+0+0+0=33. The value did not change.

33 (3+3=6) +9+9+9+9+9=33+45=78. 78=7+8=15=1+5=6. The value did
not change.

Next will be multiplication:

33x(5x0)=33x0=0. The value changed to zero.

33x(5x9)=33x45=1485. 1485=1+4+8+5=18. 18=1+8=9. The value
changed to 9.

As I said earlier Gann noted on page 112 of the "old" commodity
course (Section 10, Master Charts, the Square of Nine, page 2 of
the "new" commodity course) that you cannot go passed 9 without
starting over and that he used the 9 and the circle.
(As we saw ,the circle of 360 degrees is also a 9).

It is my belief that Gann used the circle not only because of
its astronomical relationship, but also because its main divisions
were 9's. Ditto the square of 144.

I believe he used it because the divisions when added or
subtracted did not change the "value" or vibration" or "octave" of
the number.

Here, we must be careful, because vibration and octave are not
used in the musical sense of which there is also evidence in the Gann
material. I do not want to mix the two here. That is for another
study. Value, vibration and octave here are meant in the single digit
sense.

I mentioned earlier that the high on the Dow in October of 1987
and how it was pointed out by some writers that it was a "13" and I
noted it was also a "4" in Gann terms. Using the divisions of the
                                                                        169
circle we would also have 4 by adding or subtracting:

45 (9x5)
90 (9x10)
135 (9x15)
180 (9x20)
225 (9x25)
270 (9x30)
315 (9x35)
360 (9x40)

We could have added 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, etc. all with the same
result. Check Gann's comments on the soybean price of 436 in his
private papers titled "Soybeans. Price Resistance Levels."
Another interesting aspect of divisions of multiples of 9 is
that when the multiples of 9 are divided by 2 or the powers of 2 such
as 4, 8, 16, etc., the numbers will also add to a single digit of 9,
even those with fractions.

We can see this by Gann's division of the circle by the powers
of 2.

360 divided by 2 is 180=SDV 9.
180 divided by 2 is 90=SDV 9.
90 divided by 2 is 45=SDV 9.
45 divided by 2 is 22.5=SDV 9.
22.5 divided by 2 is 11.25=SDV 9.
11.25 divided by 2 is 5.625=SDV 9.

We recognize the last line as Gann's division of the circle by
64. We can also see that it is divided by 2 to the sixth power as
2x2x2x2x2x2=64.


You can continue to divide by 2 but the result is always the
same. The answer will have a single digit value of 9!



Chapter 4-PATTERN Recognition

A nice thing about SDV is that it allows for PATTERN
recognition. The triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon and octagon
numbers or any other numbers built on the same PATTERNS will show up
as certain PATTERNS in the SDV system.

I showed you earlier that using the simple counting numbers 1
through 9 would have the same PATTERN going from 10 to 18. I also
showed you how the squares had their own PATTERN.

Even the numbers that make the squares (I showed the
significance of those numbers in my book "On the Square") have their
own PATTERN that never goes beyond 9.

The odd numbers which form the squares when added are:
                                                                        170
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27

and they have the SDV PATTERN

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

We can see that when the odd numbers reach 17, the ninth term,
the PATTERN starts over at 19. Again, as Gann said, you cannot go
beyond nine without repeating, especially if the numbers have a
PATTERN in the first place. The odd numbers do have their own
PATTERN. They are all two units apart.

The making of pentagons, hexagon, octagons and even 33-sided
figures can be checked in the same way. I will not go into their
construction as I did that in my book "The Triangular Numbers."

Suffice it to say that the results are always the same. But here
is a little exercise for you. Do the cubes. That's right, multiply
the cubes out from 1 through 9. I think that after the first six you
will already have the idea.

Remember, always reduce your answer to SDV. Just to be sure, go
ahead and do the first 18 cubes.



Chapter 5-SDV and the Square of Nine Chart

The PATTERNS also show up if we lay out a square whether it be
built from the center or from the side.

Get out your Square of Nine chart.

Some call, including myself, the square of 33 chart the Square
of Nine chart so we will use that loosely here. The square has many
constructions and can be described as a cycle of 8 as Gann noted in
his private papers, a cycle of 7 and even a cycle of 6. But those
arguments I have described in the book, "The Triangular Numbers," so
no need to go into that here.

So, let's look at that part of the square of 33 chart which Gann
called the "Square of Nine" and the 19x19 chart that totals 361. See
page 112 again in the "old"course (Section 10, Master Charts, Square
of Nine, page 3 in the "new" course.)

Starting with the 1 in the middle of the Square of Nine chart we
go north until we reach 316 which has an SDV of 1 since
3+1+6=10=1+0=1.

And that's the last time I will reduce a number to it's SDV
because by now I think you understand the method.

Now, let's go south starting from 1 until we reach:

                                                                       171
352 which has an SDV of 1.

Going east from 1 we go out to:

334 which has an SDV of 1.

Going west from 1 we go out to:

298 which has an SDV of 1.

PATTERN?

Yes, they all have an SDV value of 1.

Now check the distance from the center to each of the points we
went to, north, south, east and west.

Starting with 1 as the first term we find that each of those
points were the 10th term.

PATTERN now?

Yes, like Gann said. You cannot go beyond 9 without starting
over.

Let's prove it to ourselves by checking some of the other
points. The next term north of 1 is 4. Now go to the term north of
the term 316 which is 391 and has an SDV value of 4.

The next term east of 1 is 6. Using 6 as the first term go out
to the term next to 334 which is 411 and we find it adds to 6.

Work out the terms south and west in the same manner to prove
the method to yourself.

Note that the four numbers we found earlier are bounded by a
circle. Now go to the corners of the next circle, the square of 19.
Go to 307, 325, 343 and 361. When you reduce those numbers you can
see that they all are SDV 1.

With those four points, plus the four points we found earlier,
plus the one in the center, we have 9 points, all of which have a
single digit value of 1.

If we lay out the square of 19 by 19 as Gann suggested going up
1 column to 19 and repeating until we have 19 columns ending at 361,
we would also have 9 points with SDV 1 in the same positions.

Confused?

Think of the square of 19 as an overlay on the square of Nine.

1 on the square of 19 would be at 361 on the square of Nine
chart. 19 would be at 307. 361 would be at 325 (Gann notes that a new
cycle starts at this number since two 45 degree angles cross here).
                                                                        172
343 would be at 343.

For the other points 190 would be at 316. 172 would be at 352.
10 would be at 298. 352 would be at 334. And at the main center would
be 181. Reduce those and they will all be 1's and they will overlay
the 1's on the Square of Nine.

I have made two charts below, one is from the Square of Nine and
the other from the 19x19 chart. The numbers I show are just the
numbers from the 9 different points in each chart to show the idea.


                                         307    316    325
                                         298    1      334
                                         361    352    343

                                         19     190    361
                                         10     181    352

Regular Square
of l9

You can turn the 19x19 overlay upside down, to the east or to
the west and the results will be the same, the 1's will match up with
the 1's on the Square of Nine chart.

Of course these are not the only 1's. In the square of 19x19
there are 41 ones plus 40 twos, 40 threes, etc. since 9x40 equals
360.

The other circles on the square of 33 suggests other PATTERNS,
but that is a discussion for another time.



Chapter 6-Diagonals in Squares

Diagonals in various squares can be studied with the SDV in
mind. You can work the PATTERNS in your mind without ever writing
down the numbers with a little practice.

Let's have a look at the square of 19 again.

One of its diagonals runs from northwest to southeast or top
left to bottom right. Close your eyes, give it some thought and see
if you can figure the SDV numbers on this line.

If you said that all are 1's you are correct!


                                                                        173
If you study the chart a few minute you will see why that is
true. At 19 the SDV is 1. The next part of the diagonal is at 37 also
a 1. We can get to 37 by adding 18 to 19 and we already know that
when we add any multiple of 9 to another number we do not change its
value. And by adding 18 to 19 we come to 37 since it is one less than
the number at the top of the chart which is 38. Add 18 again and we
are at 55, dropping one unit down again, etc. Work out the rest by
adding 18 each time.

A good way to remember what you are doing is to use an "adder"
which is one less than its side. Or 19-1 is 18.

Dropping down to 11, SDV 2, we find that all the numbers going
down on a 45 degree angle from 11 will all be 2's since we are adding
18 to 11 and then 18 to 29, etc.

By establishing these two rows I believe you will quickly see
how the other rows can be filled in without any additional figuring.

But for the fun of it, let's figure the other diagonal, the one
that goes from southwest to northeast or from the lower left corner
to the upper right and corner.

We will start with 1 and will need an adder to keep us on the
diagonal. Going up to 19 and then down to 20 and then up to 21 we
will be on the diagonal. So the adder is 20 since 1 plus 20 is 21.
The adder in this case is one more than the side. 19+1 is 20.

Since we can change the 20 to an SDV value of 2 we can go up
this diagonal by starting at 1 and adding 2 plus 2, etc. The answer
will be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. When we add 2 to 9 it becomes 11 and therefore
2 and when we add 2 plus 2 plus 2, etc. we get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (1), 12
(3), etc.

You will note that after the ninth term on this angle, which is
8, the single digits repeat the same order or PATTERN. Remember, you
cannot go passed 9 or the ninth term without starting over.

Going on the diagonal from 58 which is 5+8 or 13 or 4, we find
the SDV numbers are 4, 6, 8, 10 (1), 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (2), 4, 6, 8,
etc. Again when we reach the number after the ninth term we have
repeated the 4 which starts the same series all over again.

Each number on the extreme bottom row corresponds to the same
number at the extreme top in the same row as 20 and 38 are both 2's,
etc. The SDV on the extreme left row corresponds to the SDV on the
extreme right row.



Chapter 7-The Square of 12

Let us now leave the square of 19 and look at another square,
one that is mentioned by Gann as being one of the important ones, the
square of 12.
                                                                        174
Its side is 12. The adder from top left to bottom right must be
12-1 or 11 or 2. Since 12 is 3 we simply add 3+2+2+2, etc. to get the
SDV's on that diagonal. They are 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7.


                   12    6    9     3     6    9     3     6    9      3   6   9
                   11    5    8     2     5    8     2     5    8      2   5   8
                   10    4    7     1     4    7     1     4    7      1   4   7
                   9     3    6     9     3    6     9     3    6      9   3   6
                   8     2    5     8     2    5     8     2    5      8   2   5
                   7     1    4     7     1    4     7     1    4      7   1   4
                   6     9    3     6     9    3     6     9    3      6   9   3
                   5     8    2     5     8    2     5     8    2      5   8   2
                   4     7    1     4     7    1     4     7    1      4   7   1
                   3     6    9     3     6    9     3     6    9      3   6   9
                   2     5    8     2     5    8     2     5    8      2   5   8
                   1     4    7     1     4    7     1     4    7      1   4   7

On the diagonal from bottom left to top right the adder is 12
plus 1 or 13 or 4. We add 1+4+4+4, etc. to get 1, 5, 9, 13(4), 8, 3,
7, 2, 6, 1, etc.

In describing his square of 12 on page 111 in the "old" course
(Section 10, Master Charts, page 2, in the "new" course), Gann said
when you move over three sections you find the square of its own place.

Some have intepreted this as astrological or astronomical since
Gann seems to be saying that the square represents 144 months or 12
years and moving over 3 places is 36 months or one-quarter of 144 or
one-quarter of a circle (that of Jupiter) or 90 degrees. Since
Jupiter goes 2.5 degrees a month (heliocentric) it reaches 90 degrees
in 36 months. Ninety degrees astronomically or geometrically is a
square.

That seems logical, but I have often looked in other places for
other meaning. You will note that across the top of the square the
SDV is 3, 6, 9. Nine is the square of 3. This is another possible
explanation of what Gann meant.

Observing the first 3 SDV numbers in the first three rows in
bottom left we can observe the PATTERN going up, 1, 2, 3 and then 4,
5, 6, then 7, 8, 9. Moving up to the next nine numbers in the three
rows we can read, 4, 5, 6, then 7, 8, 9, then 1, 2, 3. Up to the next
9 numbers we read 7, 8, 9, then 1, 2, 3, then 4, 5, 6. Then the next
9 numbers repeat the order on the bottom.

If we think a few minutes, this PATTERN will become clear to us.
But while we are giving that one some thought, let's move on to some
other squares.



                                                                                   175
Chapter 8-The Square of Seven

First, let's look at the square of 7, a popular Gann number.

Since our side is 7 our adder will be one less than 7 or 6 for
the top left to bottom right diagonal or 7+6+6+6, etc. We get 7, 4,
1, 7, 4, 1, etc. Going from bottom left to top right our adder will
be 7 plus 1 or 8 so we get 1+8+8+8, etc. or 1, 9, 8, 7, etc.

Now let's go ahead and fill it in. Now, let's look at the square
again. The square of 7, right?




                                  7    5     3     1       8   6   4
                                  6    4     2     9       7   5   3
                                  5    3     1     8       6   4   2
                                  4    2     9     7       5   3   1
                                  3    1     8     6       4   2   9
                                  2    9     7     5       3   1   8
                                  1    8     6     4       2   9   7

Wrong! Fooled you that time.

What you see now is a section of the square of 52, another
square prominently mentioned by Gann.

For our purposes here we will make up a partial square of 52.
We will also use only one diagonal, the one going from top left to bottom right. Since
the side is 52 our adder will be 52-1 or 51 which is 5+1 or 6.

                                  52   x     x     x       x   x   x
                                  51   4     x     x       x   x   x
                                  50   x     1     x       x   x   x
                                  49   x     x     7       x   x   x
                                  48   x     x     x       4   x   x
                                  47   x     x     x       x   1   x
                                  46   x     x     x       x   x   7

Since 52 is 5+2 or 7 our first SDV is 7 and the next is 7 plus 6
or 13 or 4. We can check this as 52 plus 51 is 103 or 1+0+3=4.

The SDV on the diagonal is 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7.
Draw this on down to 1.

Dropping down to 25 and drawing a diagonal down from there we
change 25 to 7 and add 51 or 6 and get 4 in the next column. We can
check this as 25 plus 51 is 76 and 7+6 is 13 and 1+3 is 4. So our
numbers here run 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, etc.
                                                                                         176
PATTERN?

Now let's drop down to 7 in the square of 52. Going down the
diagonal from 7 we add 51 which still has the SDV of 6 and we get 13
or 4. We can check this as 7 plus 51 is 58 or 5+8 is 13 or 1+3 is 4.

As you can see we have the same PATTERN running down from 52, 25
and 7. It is the same PATTERN on the square of 7. For the same reason
that we had a repeated PATTERN in the square of 12.

The reason is that the square of 12 is just an extension of the
square of 3 and the square of 52 is an extension of the square of 7.
3 is 3 and 12 is simply 1+2 or 3.

The square of 7 on the diagonal starts at 7. The square of 52
starts at 7 since 5 plus 2 is 7. Ditto with 25 which is 2+5 or 7.

In all cases the difference is a multiple of 9. The difference
in 12 and 3 is 9. And 7 plus (2x9) is 25 and 7 plus (5x9) is 52. All
proving once again that you cannot go beyond 9 without starting over
again. Make up a few squares on your own and prove it to yourself.
Try 13 and 31 for a start.

It works every time!

If we wanted to add another row to the side of the square of 7
we would start at 50 at the bottom which would be 5. This eighth row
in the square of 52 would start at 365 which is also 5. We could add
a ninth row to the square of 7 and it would end at 63.

Beginning a 10th row we would have 64 which is 1 and brings us
back to where we stated in the first row since we cannot go beyond 9
without repeating. The ninth row of 52 would end at 468 and the 10th
row would begin at 469 which is 4+6+9 or 19 or 1+9 which is 10 and
1+0 is 1.

It works every time!

I know. I said earlier I would not do any more reducing since
you would understand by now how to do it.

But its does make it easier, doesn't it?

We could make an overlay of the square of 7 or 49 numbers
reduced to SDVs and place it over the various parts of the square of
52 and numbers working to the square of 7 would also be working to
the square of 52.



Chapter 9-The 24-Hour Square

Looking at another important square, the 24-hour square which
ends at 576 or 4 times 144, we can see that it has an SDV of 6 so we
                                                                        177
    could use a square of 15 or a square of 6 to overlay it.

    Let's lay out a square of 6 SDV style and observe it. This time
    let's give more attention to the numbers going straight across
    instead of the diagonal.

                                            6    3   9    6    3   9
                                            5    2   8    5    2   8
                                            4    1   7    4    1   7
                                            3    9   6    3    9   6
                                            2    8   5    2    8   5
                                            1    7   4    1    7   4

    Along the bottom we have 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4. In the next row we
    have 2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 5. In the third row the numbers are 3, 9, 6, 3,
    9, 6. In the fourth row the numbers are 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7. In the
    fifth row they are 5, 2, 8, 5, 2, 8. In the sixth are 6, 3, 9, 6, 3,
    9.

    As you can see there are only three lines of different numbers,
    the other three being the same numbers, but in a different order.

    We can see why repetition starts in the forth row from the left.
    Any number in the first row will become the number in the fourth
    since we are adding three 6's to the number in the first row to get
    the one in the fourth. Three 6's are l8 which is a multiple of 9 and
    adding 9's does not change the value of the original number.

    It would be the same if we were using a square of 24. We would
    be adding three 24's to the number in the first row to get the number
    in the fourth row. Three 24's equal 72, another multiple of 9, which
    still does not change the value of the original number.

    With like reasoning we can see that the number in the fifth row
    is the same as in the second and the one in the sixth is the same as
    in the third, all for the same reason.

    Now we will look at something a little different. Since this is
    a 24 hour and 15 degree chart or 15 days and 24 degree chart, let's
    convert the degrees to SDV. The first 15 degrees will convert to 6
    and we will place it in front of 1, 7, 4, etc.

    The second unit of 15 is 30 which becomes 3 and we place it in
    front of 2, 8, 5, etc.

    The third unit of 15 is 45 and we will make that 9 and place it
    in front of 3, 9, 6, etc. If we kept converting the results would be
    the same since 60 is 6 and would be in the next line of 4, 1, 7, etc.

    So for simplicity we could work with 3 lines corresponding to
    three numbers.
x              6               3              9              6              3   9
x              5               2              8              5              2   8
x              4               1              7              4              1   7
45 Deg (9)     3               9              6              3              9   6
                                                                                    178
30 Deg (3)    2               8              5               2             8   5
15 Deg (6)    1               7              4               1             7   4


   The brief account Gann gives about this square will have you
   going around the circle which can be a little confusing. That's why I
   converted it to a square and took a small portion, the three lines,
   to work with.

   A few numbers are given by Gann which on the surface are
   confusing but after we make the conversion we can put them into an
   interesting perspective. By converting 44, 239, 311 and 344, we can
   see that they fall into three groups, 8, 5, 2, which fall on one of
   our three lines. No matter what angle they fall against, the angle
   will convert to a 3 such as 120.
   The other two numbers, 67 and 436 are both 4's. When Gann
   subtracts 360 degrees from 436, he gets 76, which is 4 and just a
   reversal of 67. 67 plus 9 is 76. Subtracting the 360 degrees from 436
   didn't change its value since 360 is a multiple of 9 as we saw
   earlier.

   Other possibilities can be seen in working off angles. The
   number 436 is 16 degrees beyond the angle of 420 which is a 6, in the
   same way that 76 is 16 degrees beyond the angle of 60 which is a 6.
   Subtracting 360 from 436 gives us 76 and subtracting 360 from 420
   gives 60. This provides for the same degree in the circle and off the
   same angle.

   The other angles can be worked the same way.


   Chapter 10-The Properties of "1"

   Let's now turn our attention to a couple of other aspects of the
   SDV system. Until now we have been dealing with 9 and have seen that
   it's properties in the SDV system is the same as zero in our usual
   numbering system.

   In the usual numbering system the addition of zero does not
   change the value of a number. Multiplication does change the value to
   zero. In an opposite manner the addition of "1" changes the value of
   a number but multiplication does not.

   Is there a number in the SDV system that has the same properties
   as the one in our regular numbering system?

   Yes. It is still 1 or numbers that add to 1. We can readily see
   that because when we multiply a number by 10 such as 5 and get 50 its
   SDV value is still 5. But we can also do the same thing with 19, 28,
   37, etc. because their SDV is 1. 19 times 5 is 95 and 9+5=14 and
   1+4=5.

   I'm sure you have seen by now that we can deal in certain ways
   with the SDV numbers other than 9 or 1. My discussion to this point
   has been the 9 as zero and the 1 as 1.
                                                                                   179
Let's add up a couple of big numbers and then get their SDV
value. Let's take 194,536 and add it to 233,327. We get out our
little hand held calculator and find that the answer is 427,863. I
believe at this point I no longer have to show you how to simply add
those six numbers to come up with the SDV of 3.

But there is an easier way of doing it!

Without the calculator we could have established the fact that
the answer would be 3 by doing some mental calculations.

And doing mental calculations is the whole point of this book as
you might have gathered from the first paragraph.

The key is this:

We could have reduced each number to SDV before adding. Since
the addition of 9 never changes the value in our SDV system we can
simply drop them or cast them out.

Looking at 194,536 we can drop the 9, drop the 4 and 5 since
they add to 9 and drop the 3 and 6 since they add to 9. All we have
remaining is 1.

Looking at 233,327, we can drop the three 3's and the 2 and 7
and have 2 as the single digit value.

So our first number has an SDV of 1 and our second an SDV of 2.
Add them together and we have 3, which was the answer we got when we
ran the two large numbers through the calculator and then reduced the
answer to its SDV.

But now you are probably ahead of me so before reading further
why don't you give multiplication a try SDV style!
We can perform multiplication in the same way. We can take a
couple of Gann numbers like 44 and 67 and multiply them:

44X67=2948
2+9+4+8=5

We could have first reduced our multipliers to single digits:

44=4+4=8
67=6+7=13=1+3=4

Then multiply them:

8x4=32=3+2=5

Let's look at subtraction. In our normal system if we subtract 7
from 5 we get -2. If we subtract any greater number from a lesser
number we will always have a minus number.

But in our SDV system if we subtract 7 from 5 we get 7!
                                                                        180
It took me quite a while to figure that out, long after I had
come up with the 9 as zero. But when I did figure it out it seemed so
simple.

Want to give it a try before going on? I'll wait. I need a good
rest!

Got it? Ok. Let's have a look at it.

To subtract a larger number from a smaller in the SDV system
simply add 9 to the smaller and then subtract. Adding 9 to 5 gives 14
which does not change its value. Now subtract 7 from 14 and the
answer is 7.

25 is a 7 and 32 is a 5 and 25 from 32 is 7, so 7 from 5 is 7.

We know that 7 minus 7 is 0 in our regular number system. In our
SDV system we can change the first 7 to 16 by adding 9. Now subtract
7 and you are back to 9. Again we are using 9 as zero.



Chapter 11-Single Digit on the Square of Nine

Going along the angles on a square chart like a 19x19 is pretty
straight forward. However the charts where the numbers begin in the
center such as the Square of Nine and the Square of Four can be a
little confusing because of the way they are constructed.

As I said before I do not want to get into a long discussion of
the construction of the Square of Nine chart and wander far afield.

Suffice it to say that one of its constructions is based on a
cycle of 8 as I pointed out in my Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers."

The concept of the cycle of 8 is best understood by working off
the number 8 and going down the 45 degree angle that is one unit shy
of the angle which has the odd squares on it.

The first cycle ends at 8, the second at 24, the third at 48,
etc. This is a gain of 8 in each cycle. Therefore the cycles are made
by adding 1x8 plus 2x8 plus 3x8 plus 4x8 plus 5x8 plus 6x8 plus 7x8
plus 8x8 plus 9x8, the total being 45 times 8 or 360.

In other words we add 16 to 8 to get 24, then add 24 (which is 8
more than 16) to 24 to get 48. Then we add 32 (which is 8 more than
24) to 48 to get 80, etc.

Keeping this in mind we can see how a gain of 8 works in running
off other numbers. As an example let's work off of the number 2 going
to bottom left. The difference between 2 and 10 is 8. So the
difference between 10 and 26 must be 16 and the difference between 26
and 50 must be 24.

                                                                        181
Moving out on the line to 53 and going in the same direction we
can see that the difference between 53 and 85 is 32. Can you guess
the next number without looking at the chart?

That's right. Adding 8 to the difference of 32 gives us 40 and
40+85 is 125 which is the next number.

Going back to 2 and working on the 45 degree line that goes to
the top left, 2, 12, 30, 56, etc. we see that the difference between
2 and 12 is 10. By adding 8 to that difference we get 18 and adding
18 to 12 we get 30. Adding 8 to 18 we get 26 and adding 26 to 30 we
get 56. In other words the difference between the numbers grows by 8
each time.

Going straight out from 2 to the left we come to 11. The
difference is 9. Add 8 to that difference and we get l7, which added
to 11 gives 28.

We can work off the number 3 in the three directions in the same
way. But the number under the 2 is 9 and it will work only to the
bottom left. It will not work straight out or to the top left. We can
see that going straight out the difference between 9 and 10 is 1 and
8 plus 1 added to 10 is not 27. Ditto with the difference between 9
and 11.

Moving over to the next column or square 13, 12, 11, 10, 25.
With the first four numbers we can work off them with the same gain
of 8 in the difference. For example the difference in 12 and 29 is 17
and the difference between 29 and 54 is l7 plus 8 or 25. This is the
same as the difference between 11 and 28 and 28 and 53.

However, with the 25 we have the same problem as we had with the
9. When we subtract 25 from 26 we have a difference of 1 and 1 plus 8
is 9 and 9 plus 26 is not 51.

Go to the next column and work 31 through 49 with the same
results. Then check each column working to the left and you will see
they follow the same form. They all work to the same form of the gain
of 8 in the differences to the top left, bottom left and straight out
except for the odd square numbers which only work to the bottom left.

Let's now go on around to the top of the squares and see what we
can find. We will work off of 3, 4 and 5. You have already seen how
the numbers work off of 3 going to top left. Now we will check them
straight up. Subtracting 3 from 14 we get 11. Adding that difference
to 8 we get 19 and adding that to 14 we get 33.

Going to top right we have 15 minus 3 is 12 and 12 plus 8 is 20
and 20 plus 15 is 35. We can work off of the 4 and 5 in the same
manner. But we cannot drop back to the 2 and go straight up or to the
top right, because the differences won't work out. Up in the next
square, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 can be worked by the same method. Ditto
going up into the next set of numbers.

Moving on around to 5, 6, 7, we can work off the numbers to the
                                                                        182
top right, bottom right or straight out to the right in the same
manner. The same holds true for 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. It also holds
true for the other numbers as we move to the right.

For example, we can use the Gann number 67. Its difference from
104 is 37. that added to 8 gives us 45 and we find that 104 plus 45
is 149.

Going down to 7, 8, 9, we can work off the numbers in the same
manner. It can be noted here that working off the natural square odd
numbers can be done going to bottom right, straight down and to
bottom left, but because of the construction of the chart we cannot
go straight out or to the top left.

Now that we have checked out the "difference of eight"
construction of the chart and found the problem areas we can see how
these problems affect our SDV count.

Using the number 25 as an example we will check out the SDV
count going to bottom right. The SDV of 25 is 7. Counting down nine
places (or 10 if we count the 25) we come to 511 which is 7. Counting
to bottom left we come to 529 which is a 7. Counting straight down
from 25 we come to 520 which is 7.

Note that 25, 520 and 529 make a small triangle and 25, 511 and
529 make a larger one. The difference in 520 and 529 is 9 and the
difference between 511 and 529 is 18. Remember the adding or
subtracting of 9 or 18 does not change the SDV value.

Going straight out to the left from 25 we can see that the count
over to 450 is not a 7. The reason being as pointed out before, it
does not follow the gain of 8 sequence.

As we noted when working off the numbers 3, 4 and 5, if we
dropped down to the 2 and went straight up or to the top right, the
gain of 8 would not work. Therefore when we do an SDV from 2 going in
those directions it will not work.
Therefore, we have to note that whenever the gain of 8 or
difference of 8 is violated, the SDV does not work because of the
construction of the chart.

You might call this the crossing of a corner of a square. Since
it does not work going from 2 through 4, it does not work going from
12 through 14, 55 going through 31, 305 going through 241, etc.

There are places where crossing of corners does work, from 298
to 316, from 316 to 334, 334 to 352, 352 to 298. Also from 60 going
to the bottom left (through 86 which is five places from 298) we can
go to 366. From 117 we can go to the top right through 69 (which is
five places from 1) to 261.

All the other numbers on the two diagonals that cut through 86
and 69 going from top right to bottom left also follow the SDV
principle.

                                                                        183
There are some other interesting aspects of corner crossing. I
know I should't point them out to you.

As I have said a number of times in these writings:

Why should I have all the fun?

I should let you make the discovery yourself as an interesting
exercise in PATTERN discovery and have some fun yourself. But you
might not want to take the time to do the work, so I'll do it for
you.

Let's work in the area Gann mentions in his description of the 1
through 33 square, the price of soybeans in the $3 to $3.12 range. We
will work from bottom left to top right.

Going from 307 to top left we would go off the page but from our
work we know that we would end up with a 1 on the ninth square up
from 307. By adding differences of 8 we can see that 307 plus 76 is
383 plus 84 is 467, etc. up to the 9th difference when we add 140 and
our answer is 1279 or 1.

Working from 307 to bottom left we would also go off the page,
but following the same procedure we would find that our number would
have an SDV of 1.

But when we move off of 307 going to top right or bottom left we
run into the crossing square problems. Going from 547 which is 7 to
top right at 883 we have 1. So shifting back and forth on this line
does not work SDV wise unless we are on an exact count from 307.

Let's now drop drown from 307 to 306 which goes through 308.

Let's think of our series of SDV's as 10 units. Since we cannot
go beyond 9 our first unit and our 10th will be the same. For example
if we made 3 our first unit then 12 or 3 is our 10th unit or term. In
other words our first term and our 10th will be identical.

The difference between 306 and 307 is one unit and the
difference between 307 and 308 is one unit. Subtracting these two
units from 10 we have 8 units left. Let's divide the 8 units by 2 and
get four and place four units in front of 306. The four units are
642, 546, 458 and 378. Now let's place four units or terms after 308.
They are 384, 468, 560 and 660. Now we can see that the first term is
642 and the last term or 10th term is 660. Both are 12's or 3's.

If we shift down one term on this line and make 746 or 8 our
first term then 560 or 2 becomes our tenth and they are not
identical. It is only by holding 306 as our fifth term does the SDV
work.

Let's now count down from 307 to 304 which gives us 4 terms. We
subtract the 4 from 10 and get 6 and divide by 2. We put three terms
in front of 304. They are 544, 456, and 376. Now 240 is the fifth
term and 562 is the 10th. We find that 544 and 562 are both 4's.
                                                                        184
Dropping down to 302 we see that it is the sixth term counting
down from 307. Subtracting 6 from 10 and dividing by 2 we get 2.
Moving down two places to bottom left we come to 454, which is 4 and
counting up to 10 terms from there to the top right we come to 472,
which is 4.

I'll let you do the next two. Like I say, why should I have all
the fun?

Moving on around to the other side, let's check another corner,
mainly the one from 42. This time we will count up instead of down
and find that 42 is the second term from 43 (counting 43 as the first
term). If we subtract 2 from 10 we get 8 and then divide by 2 and get
four. Counting up four from 42 going to upper right we come to 202
which is a 4 and going 10 terms from here back to the bottom left we
come to 220 or 4. So it works again. Try a few and see what happens.

From our work on both of the corners, did you notice a

PATTERN?

You know me and my simple observational arithmetic bit. When we
worked off the 306 and put the four terms in front then 306 became
the fifth term. When we dropped down to 304 and put three terms in
front of it, then 240 became the fifth term.

If you worked this section on out as I suggested you would have
noticed that all the terms on the 45 degree angle going from top left
to bottom right 306, 240, 182, 132, etc. would all have been the
fifth term when counting from bottom left to top right.

Over on the other side of the square we can see that 42 was the
fifth term going from top right to bottom left from 202. If we
checked 6, 20, 42, 72, 110, etc. on this line we would find that they
are also fifth terms.

If we try to shift our count along these top right to bottom
left lines we will find that the SDV count does not work going across
the square corners unless the numbers on the lines I have mentioned
are the "fifth terms."

It will be noted that these numbers on both sides of the square
form the geometric means between the squares. For example 42 is the
geometric mean between the square of 6 and the square of 7.

I mention this only in passing as I do not want to get into a
discussion of the various means, but to those who already understand
means I thought this might make an interesting observation.

(Note: Geometric and other means were discussed in my Book IV-
"On the Square.")

We can also note that the difference in each of the 10 terms is
18, such as 660 minus 642 and 220 minus 202.
                                                                        185
Chapter 12-The Square of Four Chart

Let's now take a look at the Square of Four chart. Although it
looks different from the Square of Nine, there are similarities.

What runs on a 45 degree line on the Square of Nine runs on a
180 degree line on the Square of Four and vice versa. We can check
from 67 to 679 and from 67 to 688 on both charts. In both cases the
three numbers form a triangle and all are 4's being 10 terms apart.

Since the numbers going to top right from 67 on the Square of
Four are the same as those going straight to the right on the Square
of Nine, we can see that the numbers on the Square of Four also
follow the gain of 8 concept.

We can prove that to ourselves by looking at the even square
numbers. The construction of the chart can be stated in several ways
just as the Square of Nine.

We can say that the even squares represent 4 times the natural
squares in order, 4 times the square of 1 is 4, 4 times the square of
2 is 16, 4 times the square of 3 is 36, etc.

The even squares can be expressed in a different way. We can
make them the sums of 4 times the odd numbers in order. We can say 4
times 1 is 4; plus 4 times 3 is 16; plus 4 times 5 is 36.

Since we are multiplying the odd numbers which are two places
apart by 4, the difference is 8. For example, let's simply multiply
the first three odd numbers in order and see what we get:

4x1=4
4x3=12
4x5=20

We can see that the difference in 4 and 12 is 8 and the
difference in 12 and 20 is 8.

If we continued to multiply the odd numbers in order by 4 the
difference between one answer and the next would always be 8.

It works every time!

Since we are adding the odd numbers in multiples of four in
order to make the even squares, the difference in the squares grow by
8. The difference in 100 (the square of 10) and 144 (the square of
12) is 44 and the difference between 144 and the square of 14 (196)
is 52 or 8 more than 44.

On the Square of Nine chart we could have expressed our cycle of
8 also in 4's, 4 times the even numbers. We could have said 4 times 2
is 8, plus 4 times 4 is 24, plus 4 times 6 is 48, etc.
                                                                        186
So now we have proved to ourselves that the Square of Nine and
the Square of Four both follow the difference of 8 syndrome.



Chapter 13-The Hexagon Chart

Turning to the hexagon chart, we find that Gann described it for
what it is, a cycle that gains 6 each time around. Let's check out 10
terms and see if we can go beyond 9.

Starting with 4 and going to bottom left we end up at 310 which
is also a 4 so our SDV value for 10 terms holds up. We can see that
the difference in 4 and 14 is 10 and the difference in 14 and 30 is
16. So the difference of the difference is 6. We see that 30 from 52
is 22 and 22 is 6 more than 16, etc.

If we subtract 4 from 310 we get 306, which is 51 times 6. It is
also 34 times 9 and adding 306 to 4 did not change the value of 4.

An interesting aspect of this chart shows up when we view it
from top to bottom. Looking at the top from 60 degrees to 120 degrees
we can see that the first row on top has 23 numbers and the row after
that 22 and the next down 21.

As a result we have gaps when going from the top row to the next
down. And as a result of that we have alternating rows in which the
numbers fall exactly on the 90 degree line. The numbers are 1419,
1170, 945, etc.

If we count the numbers on the alternating rows as our terms we
find that the 10th term from 1419, which is a 6, falls on 42 which is
a 6.

We might could check this phenomenon a little easier by going
over to 1408 which is a 4 and going down to 472 which is a 4. If we
go to the extreme outside we come to 1390 which is 4 and then over to
the 60 degree line to 40 we also have a 4.

Counting up from 1390 to 1408 we find that we have 19 terms and
our answer.

Remember that 1, 10, and 19 are all 1's. When we counted from
the top or 1419 down to 42 by skipping a line each time we were also
counting down to the 19th term if we counted all the lines.

If we counted up from 42 on diagonals such as 67, 98, 135 we
would have come out at the top at 1410 or 42, 68, 100 we would have
come out at 1428.

We find that 1428, 1419 and 1410 are all 6's. This is a triangle
which includes 10 times 19 or 190 numbers. In the same way the
triangle of 10 includes 55 numbers.

                                                                        187

the Gann material in Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers."



Chapter 14-How I Did It

In discussing this material with a friend of mine he said, "It's
interesting, but what is it worth, what is the point to it?"

That's a fair question as I could see the point he was trying to
make. Like most people in the market, he was looking for something
"to pull the trigger with in the markets in the morning."

As I noted in the preface to this series of books the problem
with over 90 per cent of those in the market who pull the trigger is
that they either shoot themselves in the foot or in the head. One is
very painful, the other very deadly.

I also noted in the preface that this series of books is not to
be a "how to make money in the markets in the morning."

The books are meant to open some doors or lift the veils in some
of the Gann material by looking for number PATTERNS with which to
understand some very cryptic material.

This book is an attempt to answer the question of what Gann
meant when he said "you can never go beyond 9 without starting over."
And to that degree I believe I have succeeded.

I believe I have provided numerous examples of what he might
have meant and with these examples maybe I have placed in your hands
the key to open more doors to find that trigger to pull.

I believe I have succeeded in my task if I have done nothing
more than show you a new way to look at numbers in the Gann world and
outside of it.

The SDV numbering system is useful in being able to do some
mental work without recourse to a calculator in discovering PATTERNS
you may not have even thought of.

Earlier I noted that with a calculator you could do some mental
work while driving along in your car.

You are thinking of some Gann numbers or maybe you noticed some
numbers in some ancient book and you wondered if they were squares.
Add them and reduce to a single digit. Is it a square?

If it does not add to a 1, 4, 9, or 7, you know it is not
because earlier we saw that the first nine squares have the single
digit values of 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, and 9 and the rest of the
natural squares repeat that nine-number sequence.

I also told you I would reveal how I made a calculation while in
                                                                        188
bed one night. The problem was by no means a simple one.

I wanted to know on what odd square I would end up on if I went
out one square and up one 22.5 angle each time, going around the
Square of Nine chart.

Certainly not on 1089 or the square of 33.

Give it a try before I give the answer.
I will give you the first two numbers which you can check on the
Square of Nine chart. Going out one square and to the next angle from
our starting point which is the line the odd angles are on (315
degree angle) we find that it is 10. Going out another square and up
to the next angle we find ourselves on 28.

Now close your eyes and see if you can do the rest.

Got it?

You will end up at 1225 or the square of 35.

How did I do it?

Since the angles are 22.5 degrees each then there are 16 angles
in the 360 degree circle.

To go from 1 to 10 is a gain of:

1x9

To go from 10 to 28 the gain is:

2x9

The PATTERN was already forming.

Since there are 16 angles then the answer is 1x9 plus 2x9 plus
3x9 up through 16x9.

From my triangular work I knew that the triangle of 16 was 136.

I merely multiplied 9x136 in my head and added the 1 in the
center and got 1224 plus 1 equals 1225.

I knew that the answer would end up on the line from where I
started so the answer would have to be an odd square. Since 1089 is
the square of 33 I figured that 1225 was probably the square of 35
since I was looking for something with an SDV of 1 for reasons you
should know by now.

I got up the next morning and checked it on the calculator and
was right.

I was not surprized since 1225 is a number found in Masonic work
and Gann was a Mason. It is also a TELEOIS.
                                                                        189
But the TELEOIS is for another day.

And then you will know the rest of the story!

PS-The number I mentioned near the beginning of this material,
9776, is not a triangular number. It has a single digit value of 2
and in order to be triangular it would have to be a 1, 3, 6 or 9.
Since triangular numbers are hard to recognize and I have found no
way to find their "root" then this SDV method provides at least one
way of knowing when a number is not triangular.

PPS-In the forward to this series, I discussed the various
PATTERNS that are sought by speculators in the market. It should be
noted that those PATTERNS sometime work. But they often fail or fade
away.

But the PATTERNS I have described in the single digit numbering
system have never failed. They were the same in the days of the
ancients, in Gann and Elliott's day and they will be so in the
future. The PATTERNS are "Never Beyond Nine."

Book IX
Gann and Fibonacci

Chapter 1-Article in Gann and Elliott Wave Magazine

(As noted in my preface I wrote an article for Gann and Elliott
Wave Magazine (now called Traders World). I was one of the charter
subscribers to the magazine having sent in my subscription fee before
the first issue came out.

The article appeared in Volume 1, Number 3, the
November/December 1988 issue. It was entitled by the publisher "The
Gann Side of Fibonacci Numbers."

For those of you who have not read it the article is reproduced
here and serves as an introduction to this book.)

Forty-four is a Fibonacci number. Sixty-seven and one half
degrees is a Fibonacci number. Two hundred and sixty-six is a
Fibonacci number. Three hundred and sixty degrees is a Fibonacci
number.

For those few of you who have never heard of Fibonacci numbers I
can see you saying, "So what?"

For those of you who have "read" about the Fibonacci numbers, I
can see you doing a double take.

For those of you who are supposed to be Fibonacci experts, I can
see your eyeballs rolled back and clicking in your head and your feet
up in the air as in a Mutt and Jeff cartoon. The cartoon has a big
balloon which read, "He's got it. He's got it! By Gann, he's got it!"

Those who have read about Fibonacci are saying "What's this Gann
stuff? I thought Fibonacci had to do with Elliott waves."

It does. But there is also a Gann side to the Fibonacci
phenomenon, sometimes apparent, but often not. It is quite possible
that the Gann relationship to Fibonacci has been explored, but if so,
I have seen little evidence of it.

I am talking about such things as:

(1) The master numbers.

(2) The angles.

(3) The signs and seasons.
                                                                        191
(4) The signs and degrees.

(5) The stone of Simon.

(6) The eighth square.

(7) The death zone and the circle.

(8) The wanderings and the pyramid.

(9) The Great Cycle of Enoch.

We could add more but that's plenty for our purposes now. Let's
investigate the phenomenon of Fibonacci with the above nine items
with what I call simple observational arithmetic.

I say that because persons who write on Elliott, Gann and other
math wizards are used to writing in mathematical terms not always
understood by the average person.

Like many of you I had a little algebra and geometry in high
school and a little algebra in college, but my field for 20 years was
journalism. And when you don't have many reasons for using algebra
and geometry over the years, it becomes hazy.

Books have been written on the markets by mathematicians showing
the mathematical formulas behind certain systems. But they seem to be
targeted for other mathematicians and those persons working with
computers.

Those books are probably very good for those who understand the
formulas. But one gentleman well known in the markets and considered
a market genius in his own right said he didn't understand the books
at all.

So the methods I use might seem very elementary to those with a
higher learning of math. If so, I ask them to bear along with those
of us of lesser mathematical background as we explore the nine topics
above in simple observational arithmetic.

In addition to not being a mathematician, I'm not an astrologer,
astronomer or a Mason either. I've read a few books on such and see
some links with the Gann material, but that doesn't make me an
expert.

As I said before, my field was journalism, and I'm no expert in
that either so don't look for a journalistic gem in this report.

My "arithmetic" approach to Gann was to run thousands of numbers
through a calculator looking for PATTERNS, PATTERNS that showed up in
math, astrology, astronomy and Masonic books as well as sundry other
books. Those PATTERNS provided the basis for several "discoveries."

Before moving on to the nine topics above, let's look at a
                                                                        192
couple of "amazing" facts that are noted by Fibonacci experts.

One of the "amazing facts" is that the ratio of the first term
to the second term in a Fibonacci series is 1.6l8 and from the first
term to the third terms is 2.6l8. They also like to tell us that if
we divide the second term into the first and multiply that times the
1.6l8 ratio, we will come up with the number one.

Let's put down two groups of three Fibonacci numbers and a group
of three non-Fibonacci numbers and see what we can find by simple
arithmetic observation.

Since all Fibonacci numbers do not fit the 1.6l8 ratio exactly,
let's put down the ones that are the closest and eye ball them. The
three numbers are 55, 89 and 144.

When we divide 55 into 89 we get 1.6l8l8l8 and when we divide 55
into the next higher Fibonacci number, 144, we get 2.6181818.
Now let's look at another series not so perfect but yet of the
same Fibonacci series, 8, 13, 21. First, we divide 8 into 13 and get
1.625 and we divide 8 into the next higher number and we get 2.625.

All very interesting.

Now let's look at some non-Fibonacci numbers picked at random.
Let's use the year 1988 and separate it into two numbers 19 and 88
and add the 19 to the 88 so we get the following sequence, 19, 88,
107. Next, we find the relationship between the first number and the
second and the first and the third, in the same way we did in the
other two sequences.

We divide 19 into 88 and get 4.6315789. When we divide 19 into
107 we get 5.6315789.

In all three cases above, the whole numbers changed when we
divided the first number into the second and the third, but the
decimal fraction did not. What's going on here?

The mathematician is lighting his pipe and saying, "Elementary,
my dear Watson, observe what you did."

Let's observe. In the first sequence the division by 55 into 89
can be counted as one unit of 55 with 34 left over. and the fraction
of 34 divided by 55 is .6l8l8l8. When we added 55 to 89 to get 144,
we simply added another unit of 55 to the pot which gives us two
units of 55 or 110 with 34 left over.

That remainder of 34 divided by 55 will always be .6181818. We
could keep adding 55 to the pot and dividing by 55 till the cows come
home and we would still end up with a remainder of 34. The whole
number would grow but the decimal fraction would always be the same.
Try it for yourself. It works every time.

Let's look at the second sequence of 8, 13, 2l. When we divide 8
into 13 we get one unit of 8 plus 5 left over which represents .625
                                                                        193
of 8. When we add 8 to the 13 to get 21 we are simply adding another
8 to the pot. Dividing 8 into 21 we have two units of 8 with 5 left
over and 5 divided by 8 is still .625. We can add 8's to the pot
until the cows come home and divide by 8 and still have a remainder
of 5. It works every time.

In the third sequence of 19, 88, 107, we divide 88 by 19 and get
four units of 19 which equal 76 with 12 left over. The remainder of
12 divided by 19 gives us the decimal fraction, .1635789. By adding
19 to 88 to get 107, we are simply adding 19 to the pot of 88 and
getting five 19's or 95 with 12 left over. Need I tell you about the
remainder of 12 and the cows again? It's still working!

Now for the second "amazing fact" about Fibonacci numbers that
the experts like to point out to us. The fact that when you multiply
1.6l8 by .618 you get one or to be more exact .999924. The reason why
the multiplication does not equal one is because the two Fibonacci
ratios have been rounded off.

The two Fibonacci ratios are obtained by dividing the smaller
Fibonacci number into the larger and then the larger into the
smaller. Let's take the first part of our first example, 55 and 89.
When we divide 89 by 55 we get 1.6181818 as before and then we divide
55 by 89 and obtain .6179775. When we multiply the two results we get
.9999999.

From our second example we can use 8 and 13. Dividing 8 into 13
we get 1.625 as before. Dividing 8 by 13 we get .6153846. Multiplying
the two results we get .9999999.

Let's look at our non-Fibonacci example and divide 19 into 88.
We get 4.6315789. When we divide 88 into 19 we obtain .215909.
Multiplying the two results we get .9999995.

Let's pull a Dr. Watson and observe what we have done. In each
case we divided a smaller number into a larger one and then the
larger one into the smaller one and multiplied the results, getting a
decimal number almost equal to one. The reason for it not being
exactly one is the rounding off that has to be done.

So, let's express each of the numbers as fractions and then
multiply. We can express 89 divided by 55 as 89 over 55 and 55
divided by 89 as 55 over 89. We multiply and get 4895 over 4895. Any
number over itself or divided by itself is always one. The same
procedure for 8 and 13 gets us 104 over 104 or one. Ditto for 19 and
88 which equals 1672 over 1672 or one. In our review of the two
properties of the Fibonacci sequence we have really found nothing
magic or amazing. It is simply how our arithmetic system works.
Interesting, but not amazing.

Now let's look at some of the other interesting properties of
the Fibonacci sequence staring first with the Master numbers.

(That was the end of the article in Gann and Elliott Wave
Magazine. The rest of this book continues that work.)
                                                                        194
Chapter 2-The Mas ter Numbers

This book is written with the assumption that the reader is
somewhat familiar with the Fibonacci series of numbers. Therefore no
attempt is being made to explain its history, how the numbers are
found in nature, the pyramids, etc. That has been done by a number of
other writers.

But before we proceed I would like for you to close up this book
(or step away from the computer if you are reading this on disk) and
write down the series up to 144 before you continue reading.

I asked you to do that because of an important concept we must
understand before we go on to the master numbers.

Like many of you I have seen the series expressed in two ways.

Like this:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

And like this:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

For a long time I thought the first way seemed to be just as
good as the second. The extra numeral "1" didn't seem to make any
difference. It seemed to confuse the issue and was just in the way.

Wrong!

And if you wrote it that way, you should understand why it is
wrong.

The Fibonacci sequence is also known as a summation series. That
is, adding two numbers to get a third, adding the second to the third
to get the next number, etc.

So, let's examine the series, working backwards.

We obtained 144 by adding 55 to 89; 89 by adding 34 to 55; 55 by
adding 21 to 34; 21 by adding 8 to 13; 13 by adding 5 to 8; 5 by
adding 3 to 2; and 3 by adding 1 to 2.

But how do we get the 2?

We can't do it in the first series because 0 plus 1 is 1. So we
have to have 1, 1, in order to add to 2.

Now let's look at the master numbers.

I do not want to get into an argument here about what Gann
                                                                        195
considered a master number. In one place he indicates it is 45.
Others believe it was 13, some think it was 17 and others 72 because
of the references in Masonry. That discussion is for another time and
place.

But here we will look at master numbers as understood by the
numerologists.
I do not want to get into all of the theories of numerology
either (there are a number of books on that subject which can be read
by those who are interested), so we are only going to look at the
master numbers.

The master numbers in numerology are the double digits of 1 to 9
or 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88 and 99.

Some of those will be recognized by Gann students.

They are:

22, the number of Robert Gordon of "The Tunnel Thru the Air"
when his name is reduced to a number according to the numerology
system.

33, the highest degree in Masonry and also a Gann square among
other things.

44, the cash low on soybeans.

55, a number in the original Fibonacci system and a triangular
number. (Triangular numbers were discussed in Book VI of this series.

66, a number mentioned several times by Gann and also a
triangular number.

77, a number well hidden in "The Tunnel Thru the Air."

88, the cycle of the planet Mercury.

For our present purposes we will divide the master numbers into
two halves. Instead of calling this number, 11, eleven we will call
it "one placed beside of one" as in the original Fibonacci series.

So let's pick out a couple of master numbers and see what we can
discover.

We will start with 44 or 4 and 4 or 4 beside of 4 and add them
in a summation series just as we do with the original Fibonacci
series.

We add 4 to 4 and get 8; 4 to 8 to get l2, etc. as follows:

4, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, 84, 136, 220, 356.

Let's pause for a second and divide 356 by 220.

                                                                        196
We get 1.6181818!

Let's select another number, 77, and use the same procedure
obtaining:

7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56, 91, 147, 238, 385, 623.

Let's pause once again to check some of our work and divide 385
into 623.

We get 1.6181818!

Before going on I would like for you to do the other six master
numbers in the same way, carry out the numbers to the 11th term and
then divide the last term by the next to last term.

Ok. You have done them.
PATTERN?

Now you are probably doing a double take and saying, "What's
going on here? This can't be true. I was told that only the original
Fibonacci system worked like that."

"Sure," the experts say, "You can do summation series, but they
will never work to the Fibonacci ratios."

Wrong!

We just showed that they can. Let's observe what we did.

Instead of thinking of 7 and 4 as just 7 and 4, we can think of
them as units. In the same way that we added one unit of 1 to one
unit of 1 and got two units of 1, we added a unit of 7 to a unit of 7
and got two units of 7 or 14.

When we added 4 to 4 we added one unit of 4 to another unit of 4
to obtain 8 or two units of 4. Adding 4 to 8 we get 12, or three
units of 4, etc.

Think about that concept with those master numbers you have just
counted.

Let's take the kids to the park and make some observations. The
kids want to seesaw so we pick out one. One kid weighs more than the
other so we have to adjust the seesaw to make it balance.

One kid weighs 55 pounds and the other 89. Never mind the weight
of the seesaw itself, we move it until we get the two kids weights
adjusted to it.

We can say that one kid is 1.6181818 heavier than the other
because this is what we find when we divide 55 into 89. That is their
ratio, one to the other.

Let's see if we can let some other children ride on the seesaw
                                                                        197
along with the first two kids, which we will call kid 55 and kid 89,
without having to rebalance the seesaw.

We pick out a couple of 10 pound kids and put one on each side
of the seesaw, but it doesn't balance.

Why? The 10 pounds added to kid 55 makes 65 pounds and the 10
pounds added to kid 89 makes 99 pounds. When we divide 99 by 65 we
get 1.5230769. We upset the ratio and therefore lost the balance.

So we take off all the kids and replace 55 with a 45 pounder and
kid 89 with a 79 pounder. Still out of balance. When we divide 79 by
45 we get 1.7555555.

Again we upset the ratio and put the seesaw out of balance.

So we take off those two kids and put kid 55 and kid 89 back on
each end of the board. To this we add another 55 pounder to kid 55
and an 89-pounder to kid 89 and find that they balance.

We can check that by dividing 110 into 178. We obtain 1.6181818.

Why?

When we added the 10 pound to each side we were adding like
amounts which do not work. In the last instance we added a multiple
of each side. We could keep adding 55 to one side and a like amount
of multiples of 89 to the other and obtain the same ratio.



Chapter 3-How to Hold a Ratio

In chapter two one might think we ought to have added the 89-
pounder to number 55 and the 55-pounder to number 89 in which we
would have had 144 pounds on each side. But you must remember that we
started with a board which had to be adjusted so that the number 55
was on the longer end and 89 on the shorter end and our object was to
maintain a proportion or ratio rather than equality.

Let's go back and look at our series of 4's and 7's. When we
divided 4 into 356 we get 89 and when we divide the next to the last
term, 220 by 4, we get 55.

In the 7 series we divide 7 into 623 and get 89 and when we
divide 7 into the next to the last term, 385, we get 55.

PATTERN?

Using the master numbers you worked with you should come up with
the same results if you did it right and made no mistakes.

So, in summary we can say that any series of two equal numbers,
such as 8 and 8, when added together in a summation series will
always equal multiples of the Fibonacci series or vice versa.
                                                                        198
Another way to look at is to say that when two numbers, such as
50 and 100 that have a proportional value, that is, one-half to one,
will not change that proportion when both are multiplied by the same
number.

If we multiply 50 by 4 and 100 by 4 we get 200 and 400. 200 is
still one-half of 400.

When we added 55 to 89 to each side of the original 55 and 89 on
the seesaw, we were doing the same thing as multiplying each number
by two. Multiplying both sides by two did not change the ratio or
proportion. Ditto if we multiplied each side by any other number.

So there are two ways of changing the original Fibonacci series
into a new group of numbers which will retain the same relationship
or ratios.

We can put down 4 and 4 or any other number and add them in a
summation series.

Or we can simply multiply the original series by a given number
such as 4x1, 4x1, 4x2, 4x3, 4x5, etc.

Now, we can set up a table which will show the relationship
between the original Fibonacci numbers and the master numbers.

They can be listed down the page or across the page. We will
also have a column showing the ratio between each number which will
correspond to the ratio between any given set of master numbers.

We can see that the ratio of 1 and 1 is the same for 2 and 2, 3
and 3, etc.

The ratio between 8 and 13 is l.625. It is the same for 2 times
8 and 2 times 13; 4 times 8 and 4 times 13; 9 times 8 and 9 times 13,
etc.
     1         2        3        4          5       6        7       8     9     Ratio
     1         2        3        4          5       6        7       8     9     1
     2         4        6        8          10      12       14      16    18    2

Chapter 4-Looking for Geometric Mean

One writer once said they thought that Gann used Fibonacci, but
didn't know how he did it.

In the above discussion we have shown one way that he could have
done it.

Gann's work also was concerned with squares, so let's explore
that a little and see what relationship we can find between the
squares and the Fibonacci numbers.

We will make a little detour here in order to grasp an idea.

It was in search of a possible "geometric mean" in the Fibonacci
series that led me to the discoveries on the master numbers.

The mathematicians in the crowd will see this as elementary, but
us Watsons will have to make some observations.

Don't let the mathematical term "geometric mean" scare you. We
will go through it easily so it can be grasped.

A mean is a number between a smaller and larger number that has
a certain relationship to the smaller and larger numbers.

There are arithmetic means, geometric means, harmonic means and
7 other means known to the ancients.

I discussed the arithmetic and geometric means in Book IV-"On
the Square" and showed how to find the geometric means on the Square
of Nine chart.

I discussed the harmonic means in Book V-"The Cycle of Venus."

I do not want to go into all the means here as that would take
us far afield and I want to stick to the discussion at hand.

But, I will do a little recap on the geometric means.

A geometric progression is one that grows by a fixed multiplier
and has a geometric mean. The mean can be found by multiplying each
end of the progression and taking the square root of the answer. The
answer will be the middle term of the series and is a check to see if
you are doing it right.

For example, the geometric progression most understood by the
public is the one that involves the story of the hired hand who told
the farmer that he would work for a penny the first day if the farmer
agreed to double that each day for a month.

As the story goes, by the end of the month the hired hand would
be making over $1 million a day.


                                                                        200
The same thing is accomplished by doubling a dollar 21 times.

In like manner a trader who starts with $1 million and uses half
of the pool of money each time on a trade would be broke if he had 21
straight losing traces.
Let's look at that progression based on "doubling" starting from
1:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048.

By "doubling" we are actually saying we are using a multiplier
of 2 as 2 times 1 is 2, 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 4 is 8, etc.

We can pick out three terms in order such as 1, 2, 4 and find
that when we multiply the first term by the last, 1 times 4, and take
the square root we get 2, so 2 is the geometric mean between 1 and 4.

Pick out any other three terms in order and do the same
operation and you will get the same results.

We could pick out five terms and get the same results. We could
start from 4 and write down:

4, 8, 16, 32, 64

Multiplying the first term, 4, by the last term, 64, we get 256.

Taking the square root of 256 we get 16, the middle term since
there are two terms on each side of it. So 16 is the geometric mean
between 4 and 64.

It also works for 7 terms, 9 terms, 11 terms, etc. Locate the
middle term and square it and you will have the same answer as
multiplying the first term by the last in any series of numbers which
grow by the same multiplier. In this case the multiplier was 2.

The number of terms we have shown is an odd number of terms so
that we might easily find a middle one. The question might be asked,
"How would you figure an even number of terms such as four terms?"

Let's put down four terms such as 8, 16, 32, 64.

Multiplying 8 times 64 we get 512. Taking its square root we get
22.627416, which is the geometric mean between 8 and 64. But, in an
even series we can also multiply the two numbers on either side of
the mean, in this case 16 and 32 and get the product of the two end
terms, in this case 512.

To have a geometric progression and a geometric mean it is not
necessary to start with 1 and have a multiplier of 2. We can start
with any number and have any multiplier we choose, be it a natural
number, a fraction, a decimal number, etc.

For example we could begin with the number 10 and use a
multiplier of 3 to obtain the three numbers 10, 30, 90.
                                                                        201
With a glance we can see that 10 times 90 equals 30 times 30 so
the series conforms to a geometric progression.

Taking it out to four terms, 10, 30, 90, 270, we can also see
that in the even numbers series the multiplication of the two end
numbers equal the multiplication of the two middle numbers, another
check on the geometric progression.

With that in mind we can check the Fibonacci numbers for any
indication of a geometric progression.



Chapter 5-Fibonacci and the Squares

Let's put down the first few Fibonacci numbers again.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Without doing the arithmetic we can see that there is no
geometric progression since the ratios between the terms vary.

Between 1 and 1 the ratio is 1. Between 1 and 2 the ratio is 2
and we have already seen that the ratio between 55 and 89 is
1.6181818.

But we will do the observance anyway just to see what we can
find.

Since 1.6 is pretty close to the Fibonacci ratio found in the
higher numbers and is easier to use because it has no rounded off
numbers we will use it for our multiplier.

Starting with 5 we can multiply by 1.6 and get 8, but when we
multiply 8 by 1.6 we get 12.8. We could keep multiplying by 1.6,
getting 20.48, 32.768, 52.4288, 83.88608.

Multiplying 5 times 83.88608 and then taking the square root we
would get 20.48, which proves we are using a geometric progression
starting from 5 and using a multiplier of 1.6 up through seven terms.

But we observe that the more we multiply the farther away we get
from the original Fibonacci numbers.

Don't give up the ship. All is not lost.

Let's reverse the process and see what we can find. Instead of
starting with a multiplier in mind let's see what relationship we can
find between the two end terms and the middle term of a sequence in
the same way we would check for a geometric relationship.

Our method of operation will be to put down the first three
terms of the original Fibonacci series, multiply the two ends, square
the middle and compare the results.
                                                                        202
  We will then move over one term and do the same thing again.

  In the work shown below the first column will be the three terms
  we are checking, the second will be the multiplication of the two end
  terms, the third will be the square of the middle term, and the
  fourth the difference in the answers.

Three Terms In Order       Product of End Terms        Square of Middle Term   Difference In Results
       1, 1, 2                       2                           1                    Plus 1
       1, 2, 3                       3                           4                    Minus 1
       2, 3, 5                      10                           9                    Plus 1
       3, 5, 8                      24                           25                   Minus 1
       5, 8, 13                     65                           64                   Plus 1

  PATTERN?

  We could go on but I'm sure you have already seen the PATTERN.
  If we pick any three terms in the series we find that the
  product of the two ends will be either "1" greater or "1" less than
  the square of the middle.

  One writer a number of years ago made note of this in passing
  and pointed out about the "1" greater and "1" lesser, but not in the
  manner shown above.

  But there was a small mistake in his observance. The "1" greater
  and "1" lesser seems to be right. But if we were forced to write a
  formula for the above, the "1" greater and "1" lesser part of it
  would not be quite right.

  In checking a series that has been multiplied by 7, it would
  seem that the lesser or greater would be 7, but let's examine it in
  the same manner we examined the original series.

  Let's take the first two series of three numbers we had earlier
  and multiply each number by 7:

  7, 7, 14
  7, 14, 21

  Now let's make up a little table with the columns like we had
  earlier. I won't label the columns here since you already have the
  idea.

  7, 7, 14 98 49 plus 49
  7, 14, 21 147 196 minus 49

  PATTERN?

  We don't have to go any farther since you can readily see that
  the difference in the product of the end terms and the square of the
  middle is either 49 more or 49 less.

                                                                                              203
So the difference in that sequence of 7 is not just 7 but the
square of 7.

If we had used a sequence whereby we had multiplied the original
Fibonacci numbers by 8 the difference of the product of the end terms
and the square of the middle would have been plus or minus 64.

So, in writing a formula for the original series which is based
on one, the difference would not be merely 1, but the square of 1.

I have noted in earlier works that often the digit "1" has to be
seen in many cases not just as the single digit, but as a square,
triangle, hexagon, etc.

In our work above we used a sequence based on 1 and 7 and I told
you about the sequence based on 8. So now is a good time for you to
give it a try yourself using some of the other master numbers.

So, we have seen that there is a correlation between the squares
and the Fibonacci numbers.



Chapter 6-Fibonacci of the Angles

In our discussion of the Fibonacci of the master numbers, it
probably dawned on you that a Fibonacci series could be started with
any two like numbers.

If the series works for 7 and 7, 4 and 4, etc., why not any
other two like numbers since they can be set up as multiples of the
original Fibonacci series.

And the answer is of course they can!

Therefore any number can be a Fibonacci number if we want to
start with that number. And many times certain numbers repeat in
different series as can be seen from our table on the master numbers.

We could use any part of the circle we like for figuring the
Fibonacci of the angles, but since Gann divided it into 64 parts of
5.625 degrees each, we will use that.

We can even see a Fibonacci "relationship" here as the number
can be read as 5 5/8.

We could put down the series and simply add them:

5.625, 5.625, 11.250

Or we could simply multiply 5.625 by the original Fibonacci
series like so:

1 5.625
1 5.625
                                                                        204
2 11.250
3 16.875
5 28.125
8 45.000
13 73.125
21 118.125
34 191.250
55 309.375
89 500.625
144 810.000

What ever the relationship between the adjoining Fibonacci
series, will be the same between the successive fractions, just as it
is with the master numbers.

Since there is no further explanation really needed we will now
list the angles of 11.25, 22.5 and 45.

                       1              11.25         22.5           45
                       1              11.25         22.5           45
                       2              22.5          45             90
                       3              33.75         67.5           135
                       5              56.25         112.5          225
                       8              90            180            360
                       13             146.25        292.5          585
                       21             236.25        472.5          945
                       34             382.5         765            1530
                       55             618.75        1237.5         2475
                       89             1001.25       2002.5         4005
                       144            1620          3240           6480

Just as in the master numbers we can see numbers there that pop
up in much of Gann's material.



Chapter 7-The Eighth Square

So far, we have adhered to a strict relationship to the original
Fibonacci series.

It's purpose was to show that many different numbers, in fact
any number or fraction of a number, could be called a Fibonacci
number when arranged in a certain sequence.

Let's look at our original Fibonacci sequence again. When we
divide 1 into 1 we get 1 and when we divide 1 into 2 we get 2. From
there on the ratios between each successive pairs of Fibonacci
numbers fluctuate between 1 and 2, each time getting a little closer
to 1.618 as the series progresses, but it is not until we get to the
8th term that the ratio is less than 1.62 and more than 1.61.


                                                                          205
Let's list the original sequence with the terms at the left side
(the number with the period). Out at the side we will put the ratios
in two columns.

1. 1
2. 1 1
3. 2 2
4. 3 1.5
5. 5 1.6666666
6. 8 1.6
7. 13 1.625
8. 21 1.6153846
9. 34 1.6190476
10. 55 1.617647
11. 89 1.6181818
12. 144 1.6179775

We can see that the ratio between each succeeding pair of
numbers fluctuates between 1 and 2.

The ratio between 1 and 1 is 1. Between 1 and 2 it is 2, etc.

In the first column the ratio grows toward 1.6l8 and in the
second it decreases toward 1.618.

And we can see that it is at the 8th term that the series is
less than 1.62 and more than 1.61.

I believe that this could be one of Gann's references to the
"8th square," which he never defined.

I say one of the references because there are other reasons to
believe he meant something else by the "8th square." I showed another
reason, an astrological one, in Book V-"The Cycle of Venus."

Now we are going to examine something very interesting that the
experts might note briefly in passing, but never really explain with
the mathematical proof.

That is, the relationship between two numbers that are neither
in the Fibonacci series nor are they made in the same way we did when
we used the master numbers.
Before we go any farther I would like for you to close up this
book (or step away from the computer if you are reading this on
disk), mark down your age; mark down your weight under that; add
them; then add the weight to the total, etc. as you would in a
Fibonacci series.

Some might call this a summation series.

I call it a left to right series as when you go across the page
you add the left number to the right one, drop the first number and
add the second to the total, etc.

Carry your answer out to about 12 terms as we did up to 144 on
                                                                        206
the original series above. Don't be afraid of the extremely large
numbers.

When you get back we will look at the Fibonacci of Jack Benny!



Chapter 8-The Fibonacci of Jack Benny!

The reason I asked you to do your age and weight was to show
that I was not picking numbers to fit a predetermined situation. Your
age and weight, my age and weight or any others will work.

I have picked the "age" and "weight" of the late Jack Benny for
purposes of illustration.

We know that Benny's perennial age was "39." I will guess his
weight at about 175. Right or wrong it makes no difference for the
illustration.

We will create a left to right (or summation series) thus: 39,
175, 214, 389, etc. going down the page as I have more room going
down than across. The idea is still the same.

At the left I will number the terms as in the original Fibonacci
series. At the right we will list the ratio by dividing one number
into the next as in the original Fibonacci series.

1. 39
2. 175 4.4871794
3. 214 1.2228571
4. 389 1.817757
5. 603 1.5501285
6. 992 1.6451077
7. 1595 1.6078629
8. 2587 1.6219435
9. 4182 1.6165442
10. 6769 1.6186035
11. 10951 1.6178165
12. 17720 1.618117
13. 28671 1.6180022
14. 46391 1.6180461
15. 75062 1.6180293
16. 121453 1.6180357
17. 196515 1.6180333
18. 317968 1.6180342
19. 514483 1.6180338
20. 832451 1.618034
21. 1346934 1.6180339

If you now do the operation on your age and weight series you
will come out with different numbers, but the result will still be
the same.

The ratios will converge on the number 1.618.
                                                                        207
If we count down to the eighth term we find that the difference
in two successive calculations are in a band of about 2 per cent.

I have gone through this process to show that two numbers drawn
at random, your age and weight, anybody's age and weight or two
numbers that you could select between 1 and a million will converge
on 1.6l8 in a summation or left to right series.

If we took a small number like 5 and added it to 1,000 in a
summation series thus:
5, 1000, 1005, 2005, we could see immediately that we are headed
for making up a series that is almost exact Fibonacci.

The experts like to point out that in the original Fibonacci
series, two columns can be arranged for the ratios and that one
column will become larger and the other smaller, ascending from 1.00
and descending from 2.00 and converging at 1.6l8.

We have shown here that the same thing can be done with any two
numbers that are summed in a left to right series or summation
series.



Chapter 9-Us ing Some Gann Numbers

We have seen that any two numbers, whether they be the same as
in the original Fibonacci 1, 1 or 7, 7, etc. or two different numbers
such as your age and weight can be used in a summation series.

Let's look at some of the Gann numbers.

THE SIGNS AND SEASONS

There are 4 seasons in the year and 12 months or 12 signs of the
zodiac.

So a series could be made up of:

4, 12, 16, 28, 44, 72, 116, 188, 304, 492, 796, 1288.

The process can be reversed by putting the 12 first and the 4 in
the second position:

12, 4, 16, 20, 36, 56, 92, 148, 240, 388, 628, 10l6.

I'm sure you can see some Gann numbers in each group:

In the first group:

4, the square of 2.
12, the signs in the zodiac.
16, the square of 4.
28, a triangular number and one that makes up part of the "Great
                                                                        208
Cycle" as explained in my Book II.
44, the low on cash beans and also a pyramid number.
72, the "inner square" on the Square of 144.
304, another bean price in Gann's private papers.

In the second group:

12, the signs in the zodiac.
4, the square of 2 and the four seasons.
16, the square of 4.
20, the geometric mean between the square of 4 and the square of
5.
36, the square of 6 and a triangular number.
56, the number of weeks from the January, 1948 high on soybeans
to the February, 1949 low. Also the geometric mean between the square
of 7 and the square of 8.
240, the halfway point of the range between the 436 high on
beans and the 44 low.

THE SIGNS AND DEGREES

There are 12 signs and 30 degrees to a sign in the zodiac so a
summation series could be made up of:

12, 30, 42, 72, 114, 186, 300, 486, 786, 1272, 2058, 3330.

The process can be reversed:

30, 12, 42, 54, 96, 150, 246, 396, 642, 1038, 1680, 2718.
Again we can see some Gann numbers. There are several geometric
means of successive squares and at least one triangular number.

But this time instead of pointing them out I will let you look
for them yourself. As I have often said in this work, why should I
have all the fun!



Chapter 10-How Many Age and Weight?

We will now look at a very interesting aspect of a summation
series.

In our series based on the master numbers, it would be easy to
find out how many ones, fours, sevens, etc. we have in any summation
series of numbers.

With the sevens we merely divide seven into one of the terms and
get the answer. Dividing 7 into 623 we find there are 89 sevens.

Dividing by 1 of course would give us the number of ones, which
is the easiest to see.

But in our summation series in which we use two different
numbers for starting the series, is there a way to know how many of
                                                                        209
each number is in any given total in the series.

In our series of age and weight of Jack Benny, can we pick out a
point in the series and determine how many 39's and how many 175's
are contained in the answer?

You might want to close this book or step away from the computer
and see if you can work out the solution.

With a little experimenting it took me about 30 minutes.

Back already? That's pretty sharp.

Did you start like I did?

I thought that one way would be to select a number in the series
and then start subtracting 175 and 39 on an alternating basis. That
seemed correct at first glance, but didn't work.

Then I started from the beginning of the series to try to find
the solution.

It proved cumbersome, but after figuring a few terms the logical
way dawned on me as I'm sure it did on you.

So I put down six terms in a row to see what I could discover.

39
175
214
389
603
992

The first sum is found at the third term. We know there we have
only one 39 and one 175.

So by the side of 214 we can write 1 and 1:

39     39     175
175    x      x
214    1      1

To make 389 we add 175, so by the side of 389 we have 175 twice
and still have only one 39:

39     39     175
175    x      x
214    1      1
389    1      2

Since 603 is made up of 214 plus 389 we look at their


                                                                      210
composition. For the 214 we see we have 1 and 1 and for 389 we have 1
and 2. So we add those and get 2 and 3:

39     39     175
175    x      x
214    1      1
389    1      2
603    2      3

Since 992 is made up of 389 plus 603, we can write down 1 and 2
for 389 and 2 and 3 for 603. So we add 1 to 2 and 2 to 3.

39 39 175
175
214 1 1
389 1 2
603 2 3
992 3 5

39     39     175
175    x      x
214    1      1
389    1      2
603    2      3
992    3      5

PATTERN?

We can see that we now have three 39's and five 175's.

Looking down from 39 we see that we have the start of the
original Fibonacci series.

Looking down from 175 we see that we also have begun a Fibonacci
series except for the fact that the series starts from 1 instead of
1, 1.

We also note that for the second number in the series which is
175, our Fibonacci series in each case is one number higher in the
series than the first number.

To check our work here let's multiply 39 by 3 and 175 by 5 and
add them.

39x3=117
175x5=875

117+875=992

So our theory is correct.

Let's extend the series:

                                                                        211
39         39         175
175        x          x
214        1          1
389        1          2
603        2          3
992        3          5
1595       5          8
2587       8          13
4182       13         21
6769       21         34
10951      34         55

We can see that the sum of 10951 contains thirty-four 39's and
fifty-five 175's.

Although I have shown the idea of the arithmetic above, it would
not have to be worked out for the second number. After we have
discovered the number of 39's we need, we simply go to the next
Fibonacci number to get the number of 175's we need.

If we add 6769 to 10951, how many 175's would be included in the
total?

You are correct if you said 89. We can see that the total would
give us fifty-five 39's so there must be eighty-nine 175's.

Now try this method on your own age and weight.



Chapter 11-A Mas ter Sheet

Those working with the original Fibonacci series generally know
it by heart up to 144 or 233 so it would be easy to check the terms
up through those numbers, but beyond that it gets a little hazy.

To give you some help with that I have constructed a master
sheet.

The first column is the number of the term in the sequence, the
second column relates to the first number in the sequence and the third
column relates to the second number in the sequence.

1.
2.
3. 1 1
4. 1 2
5. 2 3
6. 3 5
7. 5 8
8. 8 13

                                                                          212
9. 13 21
10. 21 34
11. 34 55
12. 55 89
13. 89 144
14. 144 233
15. 233 377
16. 377 610
17. 610 987
18. 987 1597
19. 1597 2584
20. 2584 4181
21. 4181 6765

Since the Benny series has 21 terms, we now know by simple
observational arithmetic that 1346934 (the final sum of the 39 and
175 series at the 21st term) contains 39 times 4181 and 175 times
6765.

I'll let you do the multiplication on your calculator.

The master sheet above can be used with any summation series up
through 21 terms. If you want more terms I'm sure you know by now how
to extend the master list.

In our "signs and degrees" we took the series, 12, 30, etc. out
to 12 terms for a total of 3330. From our table above we see that we
have 55 times 12 and 89 times 30 in that total.

When we reversed the process and started with 30, 12, etc. and
took it out to 12 terms we obtained 2718. Here we have 55 times 30
and 89 times 12 in that total.

Since a summation series such as 12 and 30 and its reverse of 30
and 12 gives two different sums beyond the third term, you might be
curious as how to check that difference.

Looking at the 12th terms of 12, 30 we have the sum of 3330 and
at the 12th term of 30, 12 we have the sum of 2718. Subtracting the
two we have a difference of 612.

One would think at first thought that starting with the larger
number in the series would give a larger answer, but the reverse is
true.

We can check the difference of 612 by subtracting 12 from 30 to
get 18. We also subtract the Fibonacci numbers of the 12th terms
which from the table are 89 and 55, giving us a difference of 34. We
find that 34 times 18 is 612.



Chapter 12-The Stone of Simon

There is a stone in the Kaballah known as the Cephas stone.
                                                                        213
Cephas was also known as Peter and as Simon.

It consists of the cube of 9. Or 9x9x9=729, which you will
recognize from the Gann material.

The meaning of the stone is best left to other writers who
understand the Kaballah. My interest is strictly in the arithmetic.

In my Book VI on the triangular numbers I explained how the
cardinal numbers could be lifted out of any cube. That explanation
dealt with the cube of 33, but any cube will work the same way.

Since the Cephas Stone is made up of the cube of 9, we will look
at that.

When the cardinal numbers are lifted from the stone they total
153.

You can prove this to yourself by drawing out a square of 9
times 9 and removing the center column from top to bottom and from
side to side. Since there are 9 numbers down and 8 across (you took
out one number in the center when you took out the 9 going down) you
will have removed 17.

Since to make a cube it would have to be nine deep, you would be
removing 9 times 17 or 153.

The number 17 appears much in Gann's astrological work. No need
to tell you that 9 does, too.

The number 153 is a triangular number and appears in the Bible
and in the Great Pyramid.

When 153 is subtracted from the cube of 9 or 729, it leaves 576
or four times 144, a Gann number, an original Fibonacci number, a
pyramid number and a Biblical number.

A summation series can be made up of 153 and 576 and of 9 and
17.

Since I have shown you how to make up series and check your
answers I will leave it up to you to do some experimenting.

There is much to be said on the topics I have touched on in this
brief rundown on the stone, but I do not want to go far afield.

THE DEATH ZONE AND THE CIRCLE

Gann called his 45 degree line the death zone among others. With
that line and the circle we can make up a series of:

45, 360, 405, 765, 1170, 1935, 3105, 5040, 8145, 13185.

Or we could do the reverse:
                                                                       214
360, 45, 405, 450, 855, 1305, 2160, 3465, 5625, 9090.
There are some Gann numbers in those two series, but I'm going
to let you have the fun of playing with them.



Chapter 13-The Great Cycle of Enoch

The numbers that make up the Great Cycle of Enoch, 19 and 28,
are interesting to me because of their appearance in Gann's
discussion of the soybean market of the late 1940's and early 1950's.

There is no need to discuss where the numbers come from at this
point. I discussed them in my Book II-"The Great Cycle."

Those of you who have read Gann's novel, "The Tunnel Thru the
Air," and followed up on it know the two numbers.

The series is made up of:

19, 28, 47, 75, 122, 197, 319, 516, 835, 1351, 2186, 3517.

The reverse is:

28, 19, 47, 66, 113, 292, 471, 763, 1234, 1997, 3231.

A SUMMATION SERIES OF BOTTOMS

Let's take the cash bottom on beans, 44, and the contract
bottom, 67, and form some series.

Using the double 44 and double 67 we have:

44, 44, 88, 132, 220, 352, 572, 924, 1496, 2420, 3916, 6336

and

67, 67, 134, 201, 335, 536, 871, 1407, 2278, 3685, 5963, 9648

Using 44 and 67 in a summation series we have:

44, 67, 111, 178, 289, 467, 756

Reversing it we have:

67, 44, 111, 155, 266, 421, 687

SQUARES FROM SUMMATION SERIES

One interesting aspect of the original Fibonacci series is that
when you square two successive terms and add them you will end up
with another Fibonacci number.

Let's put down the original series starting at 8:
                                                                        215
8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233.

Squaring the 8 we get 8x8=64
Squaring 13 we get 13x13=169

Adding the answers: 64+169=233

Let's start at 13 and put down the original series:

13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610.

Squaring 13 we get 13x13=169
Squaring 21 we get 21x21=441

Adding the answers: 169+441=610

Here is a chance to use your ability to recognize PATTERNS.

Look at the two Fibonacci series above.

We have squared two Fibonacci numbers in a series, added them
and gotten the answers and we see where the answers are located in
the series.

Without doing the workout can you tell me where the answer would
be located if we squared 21 and 34 and added them?

Look at the series that starts at 8 and count the terms,
including 8 and the answer.

Now do the same for the series which begins at 13.

PATTERN?

When you counted the terms that started with 8 you found the
answer at the end of 8 terms.

When you counted the terms that started with 13 you found the
answer at the end of 9 terms.

PATTERN now?

Flip back to chapter 11 and look at the master list of Fibonacci
numbers. Can you find the answer to the square of 21 plus the square
of 34 without doing the arithmetic?

If you said that you started with 21 and counted down to the
10th term you are correct!

Working backwards from 8 you can see now that the total of 5x5
plus 8x8 will be found at the 7th term counting down from 5.

Now try it starting from the beginning of the Fibonacci series.

                                                                       216
This might be another clue as to what Gann meant when he said to
move over three places to find the square of a numbers own place.

I mentioned another possible reason for "moving over three
places" in Book VIII-"The Single Digit Numbering System."

Another interesting note about the terms. At the fifth term in
the original Fibonacci series we have the number 5. At the 12th term,
we have 144, the square of 12.



Chapter 14-Wanderings in Wildernes s and Height of Pyramid

This is one I will let you try to figure out before I give you
the answer which is found at the end of this chapter.

Beginning with the double numbers for the "wandering in the
wilderness" you can find the height of the Great Pyramid in inches.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this book and have gained new
insight into the Fibonacci series of numbers.

To recap, I have tried to show by simple observational
arithmetic:

(1) That all numbers can be regarded as Fibonacci numbers when
used in certain sequences.

(2) That the master numbers and all other double numbers can be
sequenced into exact ratios with the original Fibonacci series.

(3) That the relationship between the first term and the second
term and the first term and the third term will have the same
remainder when divided.

(4) That the product of the division of the first term into the
second and the second into the first will always be one.

(5) That the summation of any two numbers will approach 1.618
within a 2 per cent band when it reaches the 8th term.

(6) That the sums of a summation series or left-right series
will be Fibonacci multiples of the two numbers used in the series.

In most cases I have not tried to point out Gann numbers in the
various series. A serious reader of Gann will see those for himself.

Now the answer to "the wandering in the wilderness and the
height of the pyramid."

Gann tells us that the wandering in the wilderness was 40 years.
If we use double 40 for our summation series we get:

40,40, 80, 120, 200, 320, 520, 840, 1360, 2200, 3560, 5760
                                                                        217
The height of the Great Pyramid according to the Encyclopedia
Britannica is 480 feet or 5760 inches or 144 times 40.

(Note: The height of the Great Pyramid of Giza is taken from a
25-year-old encyclopedia. Recent encyclopedias list the height at 481
feet.

The present day height is about 450 feet because of its missing
capstone.

Most pyramid writers seem to believe that the intended height of
the original pyramid was 5813 inches and that the height and base
were a function of the solar year.

Still, the information I give above is an interesting Biblical
exercise.)



Chapter 15-Fibonacci in Gann?

Whether Gann used actual Fibonacci series numbers or a
combination thereof is pretty hard to figure.

Some of the ratios are probably in his material as we can see
such things as a ratio of 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 5 to 8 or its reverse
of 8 to 5 (.625).

There is a slight evidence that he might have used some
multiplies of Fibonacci numbers in his bean chart of the late 1940's
and early 1950's.

Of course everyone is familiar with his square of 144 and 144 is
one of the original Fibonacci numbers.

In his bean chart of that period mentioned above he notes that
the price reached a high of 436.

We can put on the square of 144 and have 3 squares (432) with 4
left over. (It is the 4 left over that makes me say "slight
evidence."

The time period that he marks out is 267 weeks. If we divide
that by 3 we have 89 so that makes that time period 3 times an
original Fibonacci number.

Some might feel that Gann picked 267 weeks from the 436 high
arbitrarily, but I don't think so.

There is at least one astrological reason for him doing so.

But there is also another reason which I will explain in a later
book which looks at the exact relationship between 436, 44 and 267.

                                                                        218
There are many places in Gann where he uses some multiples of
other Fibonacci numbers such as 5 and 8. The degrees in a circle is
45 times 8 and of course you can make many multiples of 5 which would
apply to his material. Ditto 2 and 3.

A number which Gann says is very important is 63 which is 3
times 21.

An index of Gann numbers is being planned which I think will
throw some more light on the subject.




                                                                        219
Book X
The Cubes and the Hexagon

Chapter 1-How Do you Make a Cube?

How do you make a cube?

That's a question I recently asked of a friend of mine. Yes,
that's the same friend I told you about in Book IV-"On the Square."

I told you then that when he, a man who had studied Gann much
longer than I had, was asked about how to make squares, he said,
"Frankly, I don't know."

I told you then that my friend was no dummy. His answer showed
no lack of intelligence and if you didn't know the answer it showed
no lack of yours.

I told you that you could ask a hundred people on a street
corner in New York City how to make a square and except for a
mathematician that might be in the group, they probably wouldn't
know.

They might draw a square on the sidewalk and that would
represent a square. But the question remains.

"How do you make a square? That is, how do you make the natural
squares in order numerically.

Some in the crowd would say that you could multiply a number
times itself and that would be a square and they would certainly be
right.

But I was looking for another answer. I wanted them to tell me
how to make squares not by multiplication, but by addition!

So, in Book IV we learned how to make squares from the odd
numbers.

Now, once again I ask, "How do you make cubes?"

Yes, those people on the street corner might draw a cube on the
sidewalk.

And you could say that any number multiplied by itself three
times is a cube, such as 3x3x3=27.

Again I would say you are right. But now I would like for you to
                                                                      220
do it a different way.

By addition!

Give it a try before reading on.

Gann indicated that most of his work could be done by addition
and subtraction and that multiplication and division were just short
cuts for doing that.

Multiplication would be a lot faster, but as I showed in Book IV
we can learn a lot about the PATTERNS of numbers if we use simple
observational arithmetic.

And addition is about as simple as you can get.

As I noted above the squares were made from the odd numbers.
Does that indicate a method to be used for making squares?

Let's look at the odd numbers in order up through 89.

Recognize any cubes in that list?

You probably saw two. 1, which is the cube of 1, and 27, which
is the cube of 3.

But we can't see any PATTERN there and remember from the rest of
the books in this series that the study of Gann is a constant search
for PATTERNS which often lead to another set of PATTERNS.

As I noted in Book IV, it is easier to start at the bottom of
the ladder, than to start at some high number somewhere. If the
PATTERN works for the first few numbers in our numbering system then
it probably works anywhere on up the ladder.

So let's start at the bottom of the ladder (which is really the
top number here since I started at 1 and went down the page.)

Let's take the number 1 which is the cube of 1 or 1x1x1 and put
it aside.

What is the next cube we should be looking for after 1x1x1?

If you said 2x2x2 which is 8, you are certainly correct.

Any 8 in the list?

No. In fact there are no even numbers at all since the list
contains the odd numbers from 1 to 89.

Can we possibly make an 8 with some of the other numbers?

How about the two numbers following the 1 which are 3 and 5.

3+5=8 or 2x2x2

PATTERN?

The first number is a cube. The next two numbers add to a cube.

The next cube to be made is 3x3x3 or 27.

Do you have any suggestions?

                                                                       222
Let's put the 1 and the 3 and the 5 aside for a few minutes.

PATTERN now?

I can see the light bulb forming over your head!

I can see you rushing to get a piece of paper to write down the
odd numbers from 1 to 89 and then marking off the numbers to make the
cubes.

Let's see your work.

Since we used one number, 1, to make the cube of 1 and used the
next two numbers to make the cube of 2, you saw that the next three
numbers, 7, 9, 11, could be used to make the cube of 3.

We had a PATTERN and the rest was easy!

So let's put down the numbers again:

1=1 or 1x1x1
3+5=8 or 2x2x2
7+9+11=27 or 3x3x3
13+15+17+19=64 or 4x4x4
21+23+25+27+29=125 or 5x5x5
31+33+35+37+39+41=216 or 6x6x6
43+45+47+49+51+53+55=343 or 7x7x7
57+59+61+63+65+67+69+71=512 or 8x8x8
73+75+77+79+81+83+85+87+89=729 or 9x9x9

And now you know why I picked the odd numbers from 1 through 89.
I wanted to take you up to the cube of 9 or 729, which is a cube that
Gann mentions on page 112 of the "old" commodity course (Section 10
Master Charts, page 3, Six Squares of Nine of the "new" course.)



Chapter 2-The Cubes and the Triangular Numbers

The triangular numbers were discussed in Book VI-"The Triangular
Numbers" and there I showed you how triangular numbers are made and
how cubes are contained in the squares of the triangles.

There are several ways the cubes are related to the triangular
numbers.

And now we will look at another way.

So quick now, how many odd numbers would we need to list all the
cubes from 1 through 17 in the manner we listed them in chapter one
and what would be the last odd number we would use?

Go back and look at chapter one and study the PATTERNS before
reading on.

                                                                        223
As I have noted before, the study of Gann is the study of
PATTERNS and learning how to look for PATTERNS is the only way that
Gann's cryptic material will ever be solved.

Gann said to study and prove yourself worthy. I've studied a
lot. Don't know how worthy I am, but I've learned a lot by going over
his material many times.

He also said to study charts because the more we study charts
the more we will know. He didn't say what to study on the charts, but
I have a good idea he was pointing the way toward the PATTERNS.

Ok. You're back now. You're a little bit quicker than I am.
It takes me a little while for things to sink in. Maybe that's
why my search in the Gann material has taken me so long.

You have the advantage on me. I had no one to help me along the
way. But you have me to point out the possibilities to you.

Let's look at your work.

We know from chapter one that it took one number to make the
cube of one. It took two numbers to make the cube of two. It took
three numbers to make the cube of three. It took four numbers to make
the cube of four, etc. all the way up to nine where it took nine
numbers to make the cube of nine.

Using that same PATTERN we will make all the cubes up through
the cube of 17 where we will have to have 17 odd numbers.

So, how many odd numbers will we need to make up this series of
cubes?

If you said 153 you are correct.

Why?

Because we know that adding 1 through 17 will give us the
triangle of 17 which is 153.

Knowing what that last odd number will be is a little trickier,
but it can be worked out once we know the PATTERN.

Go back to the bottom of the ladder and give it a try. Let's use
all the cubes through 5.

Notice that the last odd number used there was 29.

The triangle of 5 is 15.

Notice that when I did the cubes up through 9 the last odd
number used was 89.

Those of you who have studied the triangular numbers and know
why the number 45 is important know that the triangle of 9 is 45.
                                                                        224
PATTERN?

Let's put down the information on 5 and 9 that I just gave you.

5, 15, 29
9, 45, 89

Now let me put down the information on 17 noted above and I'll
let you supply the third term:

17, 153, ?

If you said 305 you are correct.

Why?

Looking at 5 we see that the second term is 15, the triangle of
5 and the third term, 29, is 1 less than the double of 15.

Looking at 9 we see that the second term is 45, the triangle of
9 and the third term, 89, is 1 less than the double of 45.

Looking at 17 we see that the second term, 153, is the triangle
of 17.

So, following the same PATTERN as with 5 and 9 we simply double
153 and subtract 1.

Now let's check it all out to see if we are correct. This time I
will number all the odd numbers in the left column so that we can see
the number of odd numbers needed for any group we want to make up.

153. 305

As you can see we were right. When we reached the 153rd term the
odd number was 305.

Now we will check our work. Since we have already done the cubes
up through 9 in chapter one, we will not list them again. We will
start with the odd numbers which make up the next cube and go on up
to the cube of 17. Since we ended with the odd number of 89 in making
up the first 9 cubes we will start with 91 to finish up our work.

91+93+95+97+99+101+103+105+107+109=1000 or 10x10x10.

111+113+115+117+119+121+123+125+127+129+131=1331 or 11x11x11.

133+135+137+139+141+143+145+147+149+151+153+155=1728 or
12x12x12.

157+159+161+163+165+167+169+171+173+175+177+179+181=2197 or
13x13x13.

183+185+187+189+191+193+195+197+199+201+203+205+207+209=2744 or
14x14x14.

211+213+215+217+219+221+223+225+227+229+231+233+235+237+239=3375
or 15x15x15.

241+243+245+247+249+251+253+255+257+259+261+263+265+267+269+271=
4096 or 16x16x16.

273+275+277+279+281+283+285+287+289+291+293+295+297+299+301+303+
305=4913 or 17x17x17.

As you can see we used 17 odd numbers to make the cube of 17 and
the last odd number we used was 305, so everything checks out.
                                                                        228
Now try one for yourself, say all the cubes from 1 through 12.
First you find the triangle of 12...



Chapter 3-Odd Numbers In One Cube

In chapter two we saw how to find how many odd numbers we would
need and what the last odd number would be for us to make up a series
of cubes from 1 up through any given number.

But what if we wanted to know what odd numbers would be needed
just for any one cube.

So, quick now, what odd numbers would we need to make the cube
of 33!

Just kidding. But before this chapter is over you will learn a
very simple way of doing it.

One way we could do it would be to find the triangle of 33,
double that triangular number and subtract 1 to find the last odd
number we would need.

We have seen that the amount of odd numbers needed is simply the
cube root of the number we are working on. So in this case we would
need 33.

So after finding the last term needed we could begin with that
term and count the odd numbers backwards until we had 33 odd numbers.

But there is an easier way!

Let's put down the odd numbers that make up the first few "odd"
cubes. I'm making the "odd" cubes here as it is a little easier to
see a PATTERN. And after all, seeing PATTERNS is our method of
operation.

1, the cube of 1
7, 9, 11, the cube of 3
21, 23, 25, 29, 3l, the cube of 5
43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, the cube of 7

PATTERN?

Let me put them down again:

                                                       1
                                                  7    9   11
                                            21   23   25   29   31
                                   43       45   47   49   51   53   55



                                                                          229
Now do you see the PATTERN?

Look straight down from the 1. We have 1, 9, 25, 49.

Got it now?

That's right. They are all squares. And each is a middle term in
its series.

For the cube of 3 we have 9 and a term on each side of it.

For the cube of 5 we have 25 and two terms on each side of it.

For the cube of 7 we have 49 and three terms on each side of it.

Nine is the square of 3, 25 is the square of 5 and 49 is the
square of 7.

So, what would we do if we wanted to find the odd numbers which
make up the cube of 9?

You guessed it!

We would put down the square of 9, which is 81.

Since we need 9 terms and 81 is the middle term in the series
then we would need 4 odd numbers before 81 and four odd numbers after
81.

The four odd numbers before 81 are 73, 75, 77 and 79.

The four odd numbers after 81 are 83, 85, 87 and 89.

So we would have the series:

73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89

And when you add them up you get 729 or 9x9x9.

Looking back at chapter one, you can see that is the same series
of numbers we had to make the cube of 9.

Quick now! How could you easily find the odd numbers to make up
the cube of 33?

If you said that first you would multiply 33x33 to get 1089 (you
know that from Gann's Square of Nine chart) and use that as the
middle term and then use the 16 odd numbers before 1089 and the 16
odd numbers after 1089 you are correct.

Get a piece of paper and work it out. It is a good exercise in
PATTERN checking.




                                                                        230
Chapter 4-The Even Cubes

Quick now! What odd numbers would we use to make the cube of 34?

Yes, I'm kidding again. But if you have been studying the
PATTERNS, it should not take you too long to figure it out.

In making the cube of 34 we would be making the cube of an
"even" number. In the last chapter I showed how to make the odd cubes
and told you I was doing that as the PATTERN was easier to see.

Let's put down the odd numbers which make up the first few
"even" cubes:

3, 5, the cube of 2

13, 15, 17, 19, the cube of 4

31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, the cube of 6

PATTERN?

Let me arrange them again like I arranged the numbers for the
odd cubes a second time:
                                             3   5
                                       13 15 17 19
                                  31 33 35 37 39 41

Got it now?

What if I did this:

3, (4), 5
13, 15, (16), 17, 19
31, 33, 35, (36), 37, 39, 41

Yes, I have added middle terms. And the middle terms are all
squares of even numbers, the squares of 2, 4 and 6.

When we made the odd cubes we had an odd number of odd numbers.
To make the cube of 5 we had 5 odd numbers and the middle term was
25.

But when we make the even cubes we have an even amount of odd
numbers and therefore no middle term.

To make the cube of 4 we have four terms.

But in order to make the cubes we need to discover the square of
our root. If we are going to make the cube of 4 we have to find the
square of 4 or 16.

But when we square an even number we always get an even number

                                                                        231
and we cannot use even numbers in our sequence of numbers to make the
cubes. We always use the odd numbers.

So what do we do?

We simply find the square of the even number and find the odd
numbers on each side of it.

For the cube of 2 we need two odd numbers. So we simply square 2
to get 4 and use one odd number before 4 and one after it.

So we would use the 3 and the 5.

For the cube of 4 we would need 4 odd numbers so we square 4 to
get 16 and use the two odd numbers before 16 and the two after:

13, 15, 17, 19

So quick now, how would you find the odd numbers to make the
cube of 34?

That's right, square 34 and then find the 17 odd numbers before
the square and the 17 odd numbers after the square. When you add
those odd numbers you will have the cube of 34.


Chapter 5-Making Other Powers

Would it surprise you to learn that the other powers of numbers
can be made from the odd numbers in the same way that squares and
cubes are made?

Ok, ok. I'm not going to say "Quick now, make the power of a
certain number." But I'm sure that from your PATTERN observations you
could probably do it.

In Book IV-"On the Square," we saw how squares are made from the
odd numbers and in this book we have seen how the cubes are made so
now let's have a look at how the fourth power of numbers are made
simply from the addition of odd numbers.

Let's put down the fourth power of the first three "odd"
numbers.

1x1x1x1=1
3x3x3x3=81
5x5x5x5=625

Look back at the odd numbers listed in chapter two and see if
you can find some which add to the above answers.

Hint: The number of odd numbers needed in each case will match
the square root. Example, for the fourth power of 1 we need only 1
odd number.

                                                                        232
Go ahead and give it a try. I'm going to rest awhile.

Back already?

Let's have a look at your work.

The first one is easy. 1 to any power including the power of
zero is always 1.

So let's put that down:

1=1x1x1

With some experimenting you might have found that 25, 27 and 29
add to 81.

With some more experimenting it might have taken you awhile to
find that 121, 123, 125, 127 and 129 add to 625.

Let's stack them as we did with the cubes to look for a PATTERN.

                                             1
                                         25 27 29
                                     121 123 125 127 129

Got it now?

Looking down from 1 we can see that 27 is the cube of 3 and 125
is the cube of 5.
So to make the fourth power of 3 we simply cube 3 and use that
for our middle term and add one odd number before it and one odd
number after it.

To make the fourth power of 5 we simply cube 5 and use that for
our middle term and add the two odd terms before it and the two odd
terms after it.

Now, how about the even numbers to the power of four.

Here again we have the same situation as we did with the cubes.

To made the fourth power of 2 or 16 we use:

7+9=16

The cube of 2 or 8 falls between 7 and 9. But since 8 is an even
number we do not use it in our total. We just use it as in any even
fourth power or any other power to locate the odd numbers that we
need.

Now, why don't you do the fourth power of 4.

If you used the cube of 4 as your middle term and then added the
two odd numbers before that middle term and the two after you did it

                                                                       233
right as:

61+63+65+67=256

What if we wanted to make the "fifth" power of four by the same
method.

We would use 256 (the fourth power) as our middle term and use
the two odd numbers before that and the two odd numbers after that:

253+255+257+259=1024 or 4x4x4x4x4

It works for any number to any power!

If we wanted to do 5 to the 10th power we would use 5 to the 9th
power as our middle term and find the two odd numbers before that
middle term and the two after and those four plus our middle term
would equal the 10th power of 5.

I never showed you this in the making of the squares. Now is a
good time to try it. Find the 9 odd numbers that make up the square
of 9. What is the series middle term and why is it the middle term?



Chapter 6-Cube+Square=Square

As the title of this chapter suggests there are some cubes that
can be added to squares and the total will be a square.

Think about it a few minutes.

Since cubes are made from certain odd numbers in order and
squares are made from certain odd numbers in order, does it not seem
logical to combine the two to get another square?

Think about it again.

What are the odd numbers used to make the cube of 5?

Remember we used the square of 5 to get our middle term and then
used the two odd numbers before that square and the two after.

So the odd numbers used to make the cube of 5 are:

21, 23, 25, 27 and 29

We know from Book IV that a square can be made using the odd
number starting at 1 on up to any odd number you want to use.

So here we could have a square formed from the odd numbers 1
through 19.

We know from our work in that book to find the square we are
making with the odd numbers we simply add 1 to the last odd number
                                                                       234
and divide by 2, so if we add 1 to 19 and divide by 2 we get 10, so
the square made from 1 through 19 is the square of 10 or 10x10=100.

Since we are adding the odd numbers from 21 through 29 to make
the cube of 5, we are also making a square from the odd numbers from
1 through 29.

We know that by adding 1 to 29 and dividing by 2 we get 15 so we
must be making the square of 15 or 15x15=225.

And the square of 10 or 10x10=100 plus the cube of 5 or
5x5x5=125 totals 225 or the square of 15.

In my Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers" I pointed out how the
cubes are contained in the squares of the triangles and this is one
of the proofs for it.

Try one for yourself, say the cube of 6 and the square that is
before the cube and the square that is made when the square before
the cube is added to the cube.

The same method can be used for other powers.

From our earlier work we saw that 7+9=16 or the fourth power of
2. The odd numbers before 7 are 1, 3 and 5 and when added they make 9
or the square of 3.

And from that favorite of the Masons, the 47th principle of
Euclid or the Pythagoran theory we know that 9 plus 16 is 25 or the
square of 5.

And we can check that as 1+3+5+7+9=25 or the square of 5.

Try some others for yourself. Say, the fourth power of 3 and I
think you will see something very interesting!



Chapter 7-Building Cubes Like Squares

In Book IV-"On the Square" we followed a man when he tiled a
bathroom floor to see how squares are made numerically.

We can do the same thing with the cubes.

This will take some imagination on your part since there is no
way I can show you a cube. So the squares I show in this chapter are
"cubes" and you will have to picture the "depth" of the cubes.

So let's put down:

And we will call that 1x1x1

To make the cube of 2 we will put 2 units to the north of the
one, two units to the northeast and two to the east and one on top of
                                                                        235
the original 1. I have numbered the units that contain the two units
1, 2, 3.

So, we have 2x3

And since we place 1 on top of the original 1 we have

(2x3)+1=7

Since this is all placed on top of the original 1 we have

1=1, the cube of 1
(2x3)+1=7, and 1 plus 7 equals 8 or 2x2x2

Then in the places I have marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they would be
three deep so we would have 3x5 or 15 and we would have to put a unit
each on 1 and on 1, 2, 3 at bottom left for a total of 4 so we have
added:

(3x5)+4=19

So we add that to the other group already made:

1=1
(2x3)+1=7
(3x5)+4=19

And 1+7+19=27 or 3x3x3

Let's add another group and number them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
They will be four deep so there are 4x7=28 in this group.

We will have to place one each on the other units to build them
up to the same height. So we put one unit each on those 9.

Now in the total group we have:

1=1
(2x3)+1=7
(3x5)+4=19
(4x7)+9=37

And 1+7+19+37=64 or 4x4x4.
PATTERN?

Without drawing out the cubes as I have, can you now supply the
next line to the group of numbers above to make the next cube,
5x5x5=125.

I will give you a start by subtracting 64 from 125 so that we
know that we will need 61 units.

(1x1)+0=1
(2x3)+1=7
(3x5)+4=19
                                                                        236
(4x7)+9=37
(?x?)+?=61

In the row to the left of the multiplication sign we can see
that we have the natural numbers in order, 1, 2, 3, 4 so the next
number under 4 would be 5.

On the right side of the multiplication sign we can see that we
have the natural odd numbers in order, 1, 3, 5, 7, so the next odd
number would be 9.

On the right side of the plus sign we have the squares in order
and although zero is not a natural number as explained in Book IV, I
have put it in here as a convenience so the squares are 0, 1, 4, 9
and the next would be 16.

So if you said the numbers for the next group are:

(5x9)+16=61

You are correct.

Add some other groups in the same way and then add the answers
and you will always have a cube.

Did you notice that the numbers in the parentheses when
multiplied equal a triangular number and those numbers are every
other triangle?

We will see triangles and their relationship to the cubes again
later in this book.

Meanwhile note that (4x9)+25=61. Another PATTERN! Give it a look
in light of what you have seen above and see if you can take the
PATTERN all the way back to its origins and compare it to the other
PATTERN we looked at above.


Chapter 8-Squares and Geo Means

We will now look at another way to build cubes.

We will build them with the squares and the geometric means
between the squares.

The geometric means was discussed in Book IV-"On the Square" and
I showed how to find those means on the Square of Nine Chart.

Later we will look at the geometric means on the hexagon chart,
but for now let's stick to the work at hand.

So put on your PATTERN cap and let's have a look at the first
two squares and the geometric mean between them.

1x1=1
                                                                       237
1x2=2
2x2=4 and 1+2+4=7, the difference in the cube of 1 and the cube
of 2.

2x2=4
2x3=6
3x3=9 and 4+6+9=19, the difference in the cube of 2 and the cube
of 3.

Next PATTERN please!

If you said:

3x3=9
3x4=12
4x4=16 and 9+12+16=37, the difference in the cube of 3 and the
cube of 4, you are correct.

Now I would like for you to find the difference in the cube of 7
and the cube of 8.

If you said:

7x7=49
7x8=56
8x8=64 and 49+56+64=169, then you are correct again.

Since you still have your PATTERN cap on I would like for you to
use the same method to find the difference in the "fourth" powers of
some numbers.

To avoid getting into some very big numbers let's just say that
we want to find the difference in the fourth power of 2 and the
fourth power of 3.

Hint: We used the square or "second" power and their geometric
means to find the difference in the "third" power or cubes.

If you said let's use the cubes and their geometric means you
are correct!

Remember that squares have one geometric means, but cubes have
two.
So let's work it out:

2x2x2=8
2x2x3=12
2x3x3=18
3x3x3=27 and 8+12+18+27=65

The fourth power of 3 is 3x3x3x3 or 81 and the fourth power of 2
is 2x2x2x2 or 16. And 81 minus 16 is 65, so we are correct.

This method works for any other powers. If we were looking for
the difference in the "fifth" power of 2 and the "fifth" power of 3,
                                                                       238
we would use the total of the "fourth" power of two and the "fourth"
power of 3 plus their geometric means.

You have probably noticed that we used successive squares and
their means to find the difference in cubes.

But there is a way to find the difference in non-successive
cubes.

Let's make the difference in the cube of 2 which is 8 and the
cube of 4 which is 64. The answer is 56.

Let's see if we can find that answer using the same method as
before:

2x2=4
2x4=8
4x4=16 and 4+8+16=28.

PATTERN?

Let's look at another one, 4 and 7. Again the cube of 4 is 64
and the cube of 7 is 343 and the difference is 279.

Using the same method as before:

4x4=16
4x7=28
7x7=49 and 16+28+49=93

PATTERN now?

With the 2 and 4 we got 28. The difference was 56.
With 4 and 7 we got 93. The difference was 279.

The difference between 2 and 4 is 2 and 2x28=56.

Can you do the next one, the 4 and 7.

If you said the difference in 4 and 7 is 3 and 3x93=279 you are
correct.

This also works for other powers, but I will let you work out a
few on your own. As I have said many times before, "Why should I have
all the fun!"




Chapter 9-The Double Cubes

The double cubes can be made simply by multiplying the odd
                                                                        239
numbers that we used to make the single cubes by 2.

A couple of Gann's important numbers involve a square and a
double cube.

We all know about the number 144. Yes, it is the square of 12
and I imagine that is what most people think when they think about
the number 144.

It is also a Fibonacci number and I'm sure most of you know
that.

It's square is found in certain computations of the numbers that
make up the Great Pyramid, but that is for another study.

But the number is also the product of two numbers which can be
used in squaring the circle, 9 and 16.

At first glance we would say then that 144 is the product of the
square of 3 or 3x3 and the square of 4 or 4x4.

But look again. It is also the product of something else that
those two numbers represent.

A square and a double cube!

(Double cubes are mentioned in Masonry in connection with the
zodiac).

The square of course is 3x3. And the double cube is 2x2x2 (which
is 8) times 2.

This might not seem so significant if Gann did not speak of
another number which is the product of a square and a double cube.

On page 112 of the "old" commodity course (Section 10, Master
Charts, page 3, of the "new" course) Gann speaks of the 6 squares
of 9 or 6x81=486.

I showed in Book IV-"On the Square" that this number is one of
the geometric means between the cube of 6 and the cube of 9.

But that is not its significance here.

The number 486 can also be expressed as 9x54.

Again 9 is the square of 3 and 54 is a double cube since it is
3x3x3x2.



Chapter 10-Geometric Means on the Hexagon

Before we move on toward finding the cubes on the hexagon you
might be interested in the geometric means found there.
                                                                     240
The geometric means were discussed in Book IV-"On the Square" so
I will not go into all that here. But if you have read the book you
will have the idea.

The geometric means between the successive squares do not make
the nice PATTERNS here as they did on the Square of Nine chart.

But there are some interesting PATTERNS and we will look at a
few of those. Let's work off the first few squares starting with the
square of two and working down the 240 degree angle and checking
every over number.

2x2=4
5x6=30
8x10=80

There is a PATTERN being made so put on your PATTERN cap and see
if you can supply the next geometric mean that follows the same
PATTERN without looking it up on the chart.

If you said 11x14=154 you are correct.

Why is that correct?

We can see that the numbers to the left of the multiplication
sign grow by 3 and 8 plus 3 is 11.

We can see that the numbers to the right of the multiplication
sign grow by 4 and 4 plus 10 is 14.

So we multiply 11x14 to get our answer.

Now go ahead and do the next one.

Let's move over to the 300 degree line and work off of the
square of four and check ever other number in the same way.

4x4=16
7x8=56

Do I have to go any farther? Isn't the PATTERN already apparent?

Yes, it follows the same PATTERN as before. The difference in
the numbers in the column to the left of the multiplication sign is 3
and to the right it is 4.

So now can you supply the next geometric mean that would follow
the same PATTERN?

If you said 10x12=120 you are right. Check it on the hexagon
chart.

Now move up to the square of three on the 90 degree angle.

                                                                        241
3x3=9
6x7=42

Need I say more?



Chapter 11-The Cubes on the Hexagon

I know you have been patiently waiting for me to say something
about Gann and the hexagon and how the chart relates to the cube.

But the work that has gone on before has set up some of the
ground work for this discussion.

Gann's discussion of the hexagon begins on page 113 in the "old"
course (Section 10, Master Charts, in the "new " course).

He notes that something can be built with six sides and earlier
in his discussion of the cube he noted it had six sides or we might
say it has six faces.

The word hexagon itself means a six-sided polygon.

With that in mind I would like for you to locate the cubes of 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the hexagon chart.

Got them?

Any PATTERN here?

Well, don't feel bad if you didn't find a PATTERN, I didn't
either.

But you and I both know that there must be a PATTERN somewhere.

But locating the cubes on the chart doesn't do it.

On the Square of Nine chart, we could located both the even and
odd squares and find that they run on certain lines, but that is not
true with the hexagon.

But, wait a minute! There is a PATTERN!

Look back at chapter 7.

We see the numbers, 1, 7, 19, 37.

Now look at your hexagon chart again and locate those numbers.

They are located just above the line that Gann calls 360
degrees.

Does that suggest anything?

                                                                       242
Look at the 360 degree line, the one that contains 6, 18, 36.

PATTERN?

When discussing the "cycle of eight" in Book IV-"On the Square,"
I noted that the cycle of six was based on the same idea.

What is that idea?

The cycles are made by taking 1 unit of the cycle and adding 2
units, then 3 units, then 4 units, etc.

So the cycle of six is made:

1x6 plus 2x6 plus 3x6 plus 4x6, etc.

We can put those down like so:

1x6
2x6
3x6
4x6

Since the addition of the numbers on the left make up triangular
numbers we can express the cycle as 6 times a triangular number for
any place in the cycle.

In this case the triangle of 4 is 10 so when we add 1x6, plus
2x6, plus 3x6, plus 4x6, we can express that as 10 times 6 or 60.

Look for 60 on the hexagon chart for confirmation of that idea.

The triangle of 9 is 45. So if we multiply 45 times 6 we get 270
and we can find it on that 360 degree line.

Do a few for yourself to prove the idea.

Note that the numbers we listed above 1, 7, 19, 37 are one unit
above the 360 degree line. So what does that suggest?

Let's try this. Multiply 153 times 6 and add 1.

The answer is 919. Find it on the chart.

Yes, it runs on the same line as 1, 7, 19, 37, etc.

And what are those numbers? If you followed chapter seven very
carefully you would have seen that they are the differences in the
cubes.

If they are the differences then they will add to the cubes!

1 is the cube of 1.
1+7 is 8, the cube of 2.
1+7+19 is 27, the cube of 3.
                                                                      243
So, we have finally found the cubes on the hexagon chart and we
have found a PATTERN!

Is there a way of knowing what two cubes the numbers on this
line are the difference of?

Without doing the workout do you know what the two cubes the
number 919 is the difference of?

Let's go to the bottom of that ladder again.

1 is the triangle of "1."

6x1 is 6. 6 plus 1 is 7.

7 is the difference in the cube of "1" and the cube of 2.

3 is the triangle of "2."

6x3 is 18. 18 plus 1 is 19.

19 is the difference in the cube of "2" and the cube of 3.
Got it now?

Look at the numbers around which I have placed quotation marks
and give it another try.

Now once again what are the two cubes that 919 is the difference
of?

If you said 17 and 18 you are correct.

Are we on the right track about the cubes?

Let's look at Gann's discussion again about the hexagon chart.

He starts at 1 and tells us that the first cycle ends at 7, the
second at 19, the third at 37, etc., each time gaining six units.

At no time does he tell us that the numbers we are making are
the differences in cubes. Just another one of his well hidden
methods.

When you compare the Square of Nine and the hexagon as he says
you will also find some other well hidden relationships.

Gann mentions that one of the cycles falls on 169 and that
number is important for more reasons than one. Of course one of those
reasons is that it is the square of 13. It also shows up in the
workout on the soybean chart of the late 1940's and early 1950's.

(It is also well hidden in "The Tunnel Thru the Air.")

I noted in Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers" that I thought
                                                                        244
Gann's material was based more on the triangles than on the squares
and that numbers mentioned in his material seemed to indicate that.

So, I will leave you with this last PATTERN for you to find. He
mentions that 360 runs from the main center. Obviously all numbers on
the hexagon run from the "center," so he must have meant something
else when he mentioned the 180 degrees or the 90 degrees. With what
you know now, figure out what he meant!




                                                                        245
Book XI
Gann and the Teleois
Whether or not Gann had a knowledge of the Teleois is a matter
of conjecture on my part. Although he never mentions it by name,
there appears to be times when he is referring to it.

Whether he did that or not I know there are Teleois angles on
the Square of Nine chart.

What is the Teleois, you ask. Good question. The word itself
seems to mean perfect from what little I have found about the word.
Whether that means the Teleois numbers are perfect, I don't know,
since in many writings I have found several numbers referred to as
perfect numbers. Some are Teleois and some are not.

My introduction to the Teleois came from a book written about
1940 called "The Prophecies of Melchizedek" by Brown Landone.

Landone found Teleois relationships in the Great Pyramids, the
planets, the human body, etc. I will not recount those relationships
here as that would be going down a different path and as I have said
in a number of my writings, we have to stay on the path we are on and
go down those other paths later.

He listed the basal Teleois proportions as 1, 4, 7.

He listed the primary Telois proportions as 13, 19, 25, 31.

He listed the secondary Telois proportions as 10, 16, 22, 28.

If we list those numbers in numerical order we can see a
PATTERN.

1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31.

Got it now?

Starting with 1 the numbers listed are 3 units apart!

Those of you who have read my Book VI "The Triangular Numbers"
in this series will recognize that these numbers are also the numbers
that are used to make a five-sided figure.

Since there are three units between each number, then there must
be nine units between any unit and the third one over. Example, look
at 7 and then count 10 as one 13 as two and 16 as three to get the
third number over from 7 and we see that the difference is 9.

You can see then that if we take any Teleois number, multiply by

                                                                        246
nine and then add 1 we will have another Teleois number.

For example 9 times 4 is 36 and 36 plus 1 is 37 which is another
Teleois number.

As I have explained in my earlier work I often run numbers
through my calculator looking for PATTERNS which lead to other
PATTERNS.
One day I was looking at the numbers on the angles on the Square
of Nine chart. I noticed when I went out a square and up an angle I
landed on a Teleois number. You might want to get out your Square of
Nine chart to see if you can see the same thing.

I will start you out on the first three numbers and see if you
can take it from there, 10, 28, 55.

When I looked at those three numbers I saw a PATTERN. If you
have read my book "The Triangular Numbers" you might have seen the
same thing.

First, subtract 1 from each number. You get 9, 27, 54.

Got it now?

Let's put down some triangular numbers in order starting with 1.

1
3
6

Got it now?

Let's multiply those three triangular numbers by 9:

1x9 is 9
3x9 is 27
6x9 is 54

Now look at your next number on the Square of Nine chart going
out one square and going up to the next 22 1/2 degree angle after 55.

Did you locate it? It is 91.

Now let's continue with the triangular numbers after the number
6.

The next triangular number after 6 is 10.

And 10x9 is 90. Add 1 and you have 91.

Can you finish the PATTERN going all the way around the Square
of Nine chart and ending up back on the 315 degree angle, the angle
that contains all the odd squares?

Now that you have done that, is there any other PATTERN you
                                                                        247
noticed?

If not why don't you write down each of the numbers you touched
as you went out a square and up an angle.

I'll do the first few for you and since this actually starts
with the number 1 I will use that first:

1
10
28
55
91
136

Got it now?

Hint! Think of triangular numbers!
Yes, they are all triangular numbers. Out at the side of the
numbers why don't you write down their roots. (Triangular numbers and
where they appear in the Gann material were discussed in Book VI of
this series.)

If you don't know them I will put them down for you.

1-1
10-4
28-7
55-10
91-13
136-16

As you can see the roots are the Teleois numbers in order!

So we can now see that the numbers that fall on the 22 1/2
degree angle as you go out a square and up to the next 22 1/2 degree
angle each time can be made in two different ways but the answers are
the same.

We can multiply the triangular numbers in order by 9 and add 1:

(1x9)+1=10
(3x9)+1=28
(6x9)+1=55
(10x9)+1=91
(15x9)+1=136

or starting with the number 4 in our list of Teleois numbers
which are three units apart we can simply list the triangle of those
numbers:

Triangle of 4=10
Triangle of 7=28
Triangle of 10=55
Triangle of 13=91
                                                                        248
Triangle of 16=136

Now you can see why I call those angles the Teleois angles.

Let's put down the angles and the numbers that fall on them as
we go out a square and up a 22 1/1 degree angle each time.

We will start with 9 on the 315 degree angle and then go to:

10--337.5
28--360 or 0
55--22.5
91--45
136--67.5
190--90
253--112.5
325--135
406--157.5
496--180
595--202.5
703--225
820--247.5
946--270
1081--292.5
1225--315

Note that 1225 does not show on the chart but this is where we
would end up going out a square and up or down or across to a 22.5
degree angle.

Now let's put in the triangular roots of each of the numbers in
parentheses.

10 (4)--337.5
28 (7)--360 or 0
55 (10)--22.5
91 (13)--45
136 (16)--67.5
190 (19)--90
253 (22)--112.5
325 (25)--135
406 (28)--157.5
496 (31)--180
595 (34)--202.5
703 (37)--225
820 (40)--247.5
946 (43)--270
1081 (46)--292.5
1225 (49)--315

And we see that the triangular roots are the teleois numbers in
order starting from 4.

Now let's do the same thing except this time we will multiply
the triangular numbers in order and add 1.
                                                                     249
10 (9x1)+1--337.5
28 (9x3)+1--360 or 0
55 (9x6)+1--22.5
91 (9x10)+1--45
136 (9x15)+1--67.5
190 (9x21)+1--90
253 (9x28)+1--112.5
325 (9x36)+1--135
406 (9x45)+1--157.5
496 (9x55)+1--180
595 (9x66)+1--202.5
703 (9x78)+1--225
820 (9x91)+1--247.5
946 (9x105)+1--270
1081 (9x120)+1--292.5
1225 (9x136)+1--315

I will note here that Gann made mention of some of the numbers
above.

In his account of US Steel, he told about the price having
resistance at 55.

In talking about soybeans he noted that they were in the 253rd
month.

In his discussion of the Square of Nine chart he said there was
a change in cycles at 325.

We have seen that in all three instances the numbers were on the
Teleois angles!




                                                                   250
Book XII
Gann's Magic Square

Chapter 1--The Search For Gann's Squares

In one place in his material W. D. Gann describes the "Square of
Nine" chart and in another place he describes the Square of 33x33.
One seems to be just an extension of the other and the end of the
square at 33x33 seems to be arbitrary.

But is it arbitrary? By the time you have finished this book you
will see that the square of 33x33 is the most logical ending point.

When I first started studying Gann many years ago, I was
fascinated with his charts, the Square of Nine, the Square of Four,
the Hexagon chart, etc.

I looked at them hundreds of times. At first I just accepted
them the way that they were, trying to follow them as he described
them in his material, mostly just coming to a dead end.

I believed that somewhere he must have written something more to
describe the charts, because as they were the writings were very
cryptic.

He and other writers after him pointed out that on the Square of
Nine chart the odd squares run along the 315 degree line and the even
squares run along the line that is next to the 135 degree line.

In other words the even square line and the odd square line were
"almost" 180 degrees apart.

That "almost" always bothered me. The 135 degree line contained
the numbers that were 1 more than the even squares, 5, 17, etc.

Someone came along in the 1980's and called the Square of Nine
chart an Octagon chart and showed how it was made up of a series of
numbers that would fall on the 45 degree angles by starting at 1 and
going down to 9 and then starting the next series of numbers by
skipping every other number and in the next column every two numbers,
etc. like this:

                                           1     x     x
                                           2     11    28
                                           3     13    31
                                           4     15    34
                                           5     17    37
                                                                        251
                                            6     19    40
                                            7     21    43
                                            8     23    46
                                            9     25    49

In the next column you would add 4 to 49 to get the first number
and then 4 to that, etc. until you get the next odd square which
would be 81.

Notice how the "1" is placed. It is placed above the rows that
make up the rest of the material. It is placed this way so that the
numbers along the bottom row will run on the odd squares. The writers
called this arrangement an Octagon.

That's probably a good description, but I think a better
description would be a "plus 1 Octagon arrangement."

Gann never said how this chart was constructed. He listed the
numbers that fell on the 90 degree angles. In one place he called it
the Square of Nine chart or the square of 19x19 and in another place
he called it the square of 33.

There is a definite PATTERN between the square of 19 and the
square of 33, but we will look at that later on.

The one chart where Gann mentioned the construction was the
Hexagon chart. There was no mention of the construction of the Square
of Four.

And he never mentioned the construction of a regular square such
as the square of 12 or 144 and I assumed he did that because no
construction method was needed.

But we will see that the square of 12 has a PATTERN. And that
PATTERN will be discovered and surprise you when we work out the
PATTERNS of the other three charts.

So if you have those charts, the Square of Nine (and that's what
we will call it here as most people call it that and Gann seemed to
call it that at one time), the Square of Four, the square of 12, and
the Hexagon chart get them out and give them a good look.

Are they all made alike? That is, is the construction of one
just the same as the others, or is there two alike or three alike and
one is the oddball?

Before reading on, give them all a good look and see if you can
figure out their construction.



Chapter 2--A Look at Cons truction

So let's look at the construction of all four of the charts.
                                                                        252
For many years I believed that the construction of the Square of
Four chart followed that of the Square of Nine chart since the
numbers seemed to be based on the same idea, but ran in different
directions.

I considered the Hexagon chart to be the "odd ball" of the three
charts. I didn't even consider the construction of a regular chart
such as a 12x12 or an 8x8, which seemed so obvious (little did I
know!)

So let's do some constructing and see what we can find.

Since Gann did give the construction of the Hexagon chart let's
start with that.

He tells us to begin with 1 and put a circle of 6 around it and
then put a circle of two 6's (or 12) around that and then a circle of
three 6's (18) around that, each time adding 6 more than the previous
time.

The numbers come out on the line 1, 7, 19, etc.

On his original chart that's where the 0 or 360 degree line
runs, but on the chart that is probably in your material the 0 or 360
degree line contains 6, 12, 18, etc.

So let's use that line as our 360 degree line since the
following explanation will be a little easier. We will come back
later and move the line up after we have the construction method well
in mind.

So let's just count off to 6:

6

Now let's add 12 to that since we are using 6 more each time
than the previous.

6
18

Now let's add 18 to that:

6
18
36

Now let's add 24 to that:

6
18
36
60

                                                                        253
Now let's add 30 to that:

6
18
36
60
90

Now let's add 36 to that:

6
18
36
60
90
126

Let's put those numbers down as they appear on the Hexagon
chart:

6, 18, 36, 60, 90, 126

Since Gann said that this completes the first Hexagon (he has
127 since that was on his original and I will deal with that later)
let's end it there.

Before I go any farther, do you see what he has done?

Let's put down the numbers he added each time:

66
12 18
18 36
24 60
30 90
36 126

Do you see it now?

1x6 6
2x6 18
3x6 36
4x6 60
5x6 90
6x6 126

How about now?

The first column are the multiples of 6 we add each time. The
second column is the running total that we get when we add the
multiples of 6. As you can see the next multiple of 6 to add would be
7x6 or 42 and the running total would be 168.

1x6 =6
+2x6 =18
                                                                        254
+3x6 =36
+4x6 =60
+5x6 =90
+6x6 =126


But let's not go that far since we want to keep to Gann's first
Hexagon.

We saw that adding 1x6 to 2x6, etc. up to 6x6 gave us a sum of
126.

But, we could have done that in a different way.
We could simply have added 1+2+3+4+5+6 which is 21 and then
multiplied by 6 which would equal 126.

By adding 1 through 6 we got the triangular number of 6.
(Triangular numbers were discussed in my Book VI)

So we can multiply any triangular number times 6 and it will
fall on the 360 line that runs:

6, 18, 36, etc.

Looking above we can see that the next triangular root after 6
is 7 and the triangle of 7 is 28 and if we multiply 28 times 6 we
would get 168, just like if we had added 7x6 or 42 to 126 as noted
above.

The triangle of 17 is 153, a number found in the Bible. Multiply
it by 6 and check the line that runs:

6, 18, 36 and see if you can find it.

You did!



Chapter 3--Comparing the "Square of Nine"

Now let's go to that chart that everyone calls the Square of
Nine chart.

We will follow the line that is next to the line that has the
odd squares or where the numbers are 1 less than the odd squares. It
is the line that reads:

8, 24, 48, 80, etc.

Let's subtract each number beginning with the 8 from the next
number. The results are:

8
16
24
                                                                       255
32
40
48
56
64

We can see that the differences in the numbers are:

1x8
2x8
3x8
4x8
5x8
6x8
7x8
8x8

See the PATTERN?

Yes it is the same PATTERN as on the Hexagon chart!

When Gann described the Hexagon chart and said to take 1 and put
6 circles around that and 12 around that and 18 around that, he could
have been describing the "Square of Nine" chart.

He could have said, "take 1 and put 8 around that and 16 around
that and 24 around that."

The answers would have been on the line that has the odd squares
on it. Since he called the chart using circles of 6 the Hexagon
chart, he could have called this the Octagon chart as someone in the
past called it.

(But there is much more to that as we will see later.)

But, like on the Hexagon chart, let's ignore the line that runs
1, 9, 25 and just concentrate on the line that runs 8, 24, 48 etc.

I guess by now that you have figured out you can use any
triangular number and multiply by 8 and get the answer on this line.

But let's go through it again. We can get the answer by adding
the multiples of 8 as we did the multiples of 6:

1x8 8
2x8 16
3x8 24
4x8 32
5x8 40
6x8 48
7x8 56
8x8 64

And when we add 8, 16, 24, etc. up through 64 we get 288.

                                                                        256
Here again we could simply take the triangle of 8 (add 1 through
8) and get 36 and then multiply by 8 and get 288.

We could make up any chart we wanted to using the same idea. For
a cycle of 12 we could say take 12, put 24 around that and 36 around
that and 48 around that, etc. On our 360 degree line the numbers
would come out as 12 times a triangular number, 12, 36, 72, 120, etc.

Let's look at another similarity between the "Square of Nine"
chart and the Hexagon Chart.



Chapter 4--Another Similarity

Let's look at another similarity between the "Square of Nine"
chart and the Hexagon chart.

Looking first at the Hexagon chart, check the numbers starting
with 6 and going to the right.

They are 6, 18, 36, 90, 126, etc.

Now look at the numbers that go to the left or that are 180
degrees from the other line.

They are 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, etc.

See a PATTERN?

We have already seen that the numbers 6, 18, 36, 90, 126, etc.
are formed by multiplying 6 times a triangular number. But there is also a
definite PATTERN to 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, etc. Play with them
awhile. Do you have the answer?

Let's go back to the "Square of Nine" chart and do the same
thing as we did with the Hexagon chart.

Going down from 8 we have 8, 24, 48, 80, 120, 168, etc.

Now look at the numbers that are 180 from that line. Since the
line 5, 17, 37, etc. is 180 degrees from 9, 25, 49, then the 180
degree line from 8, 24, 48, etc. must be:

4, 16, 36, 64, 100, etc.

See the PATTERN now?

Yes 4, 16, 64, 100, etc. are the even squares, but there is
another PATTERN and the PATTERN is the same as the PATTERN for the
numbers on the Hexagon chart 3, 12, 27, etc.

Play with them awhile. Got it now?

Maybe it would help if we put down together those groups of
                                                                             257
numbers that run on both 180 degree lines and look at them for a
PATTERN:

3, 12, 27, 48, 75
4, 16, 36, 64, 100

Can you see the PATTERN now?

Let me see if I can help you.

1x3, 4x3, 9x3, 16x3, 25x3
1x4, 4x4, 9x4, 16x4, 25x4

See it now?

Look at the first number in each of the multiples. They are:

1, 4, 9, 16, 25
1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Yes, they are the natural squares in order!

Looking at our discussion above can you guess what you would
have on the 180 degree line if we made up another cycle of numbers?
On a cycle of 4? A cycle of 10? A cycle of 12?

Like I told you before when I mentioned the cycle of 12, the 360
degree line would contain numbers made by multiplying 12 times the
triangular numbers in order. But what numbers would be on the 180
degree line?

Let's make some cycles and find out! Remember I told you we
could make cycles of numbers by using tabular form instead of actual
circles. We go down a list of numbers that have a difference of 1 and
then in the next column they will have a difference of 2 and in the
next a difference of 3, etc.

First, let's do the cycle of 4.

1 6 15 28 45
2 8 18 32 50
3 10 21 36 55
4 12 24 40 60

We could go on and on with this, but that will give you the
idea.

Look along the bottom line. That is our 360 degree line. How is
it made? How could we get the numbers for the bottom line without
filling in all the numbers?

If you said we could simply multiply 4 times the triangular
numbers in order you would be right.

Our last number is 60 which is 4 times the triangle of 5 or 15.
                                                                        258
The next triangular number is the triangle of 6 or 21. So the next
number on the bottom line would be 4 times 21 or 84. Do a few of
those to get the idea.

We won't do the "cycle of 6" or the Hexagon or the "cycle of 8"
which is usually called the Square of Nine since we have already done
those.

So let's go on and do the cycle of 10:

1 12 33 64
2 14 36 68
3 16 39 72
4 18 42 76
5 20 45 80
6 22 48 84
7 24 51 88
8 26 54 92
9 28 57 96
10 30 60 100

We could carry this on out, but that is all we need to see the
PATTERN.

Again, look at our 360 degree line which runs along the bottom
and we can see that the numbers can be made by multiplying 10 by the
triangular numbers in order, 10x1, 10x3, 10x6, 10x10.

Can you supply the next two numbers that would go in this row?
If you said 150 (10x15) and 210 (10x21) you would be right.

Now let's do the cycle of 12.

1 14 39 76
2 16 42 80
3 18 45 84
4 20 48 88
5 22 51 92
6 24 54 96
7 26 57 100
8 28 60 104
9 30 63 108
10 32 66 112
11 34 69 116
12 36 72 120

Again, we could carry this on out, but that's all we need to see
the PATTERN.

Look along the bottom row we call the 360 degree line. We can
see that the numbers are made by multiplying 12 by the triangular
numbers in order, 12x1, 12x3, 12x6, 12x10.

Again, can you supply the next two numbers in this row? If you
said 12x15 and 12x21, you would be correct.
                                                                        259
We could make up some cycles of 14, 16, 18, 20, etc. and the
results would be the same. The 360 degree line would contain numbers
that are made by multiplying our cycle numbers 14, 16, 18, 20, etc.
times the triangular numbers in order, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.

But now let's get back to our 180 degree line since this is what
we are trying to find. Look at the cycles of 4, 10 and 12 again and
see if you can find the 180 degree line.

Remember that when we looked at the 180 degree line in the cycle
of 6 (Hexagon) and cycle of 8 (Square of 9 or Octagon) we found that
they were multiples of the squares.

Can you find those lines in the cycles of 4, 10 and 12?

Let's look at the cycle of 4 again:

1 6 15 28 45
2 8 18 32 50
3 10 21 36 55
4 12 24 40 60

Do you see it here?

Look at the row that begins with 2:

2 8 18 32 50

We can see that these numbers are 2 times the squares in order:

2x1, 2x4, 2x9, 2x16, 2x25

So this must be the 180 degree line if it is the same PATTERN as
the Hexagon and Octagon.

Let's look at the cycle of 10 again:

1 12 33 64
2 14 36 68
3 16 39 72
4 18 42 76
5 20 45 80
6 22 48 84
7 24 51 88
8 26 54 92
9 28 57 96
10 30 60 100

Can you find the 180 degree line here?

Look at the numbers in the row that begin with 5:

5 20 45 80

                                                                       260
We can see that these numbers are 5 times the squares in order:

5x1, 5x4, 5x9, 5x16

So this must be the 180 degree line.

Before I put down the cycle of 12 again, can you guess where the
180 degree line will be?

If you said the row that starts with the number 6 you are right!

Let's look at it.

1 14 39 76
2 16 42 80
3 18 45 84
4 20 48 88
5 22 51 92
6 24 54 96
7 26 57 100
8 28 60 104
9 30 63 108
10 32 66 112
11 34 69 116
12 36 72 120

Looking at the row beginning with 6 we have:

6 24 54 96

And we can see that these numbers are made by multiplying 6
times the squares in order:

6x1, 6x4, 6x9, 6x16

Now let's go back and look for a PATTERN:

We have seen that in the cycle of 6 the 180 degree line runs
from 3 and contains the numbers that are 3 times the squares in order
and in the cycle of 8 the 180 degree line runs from 4 and contains
the numbers that are 4 times the squares in order.

PATTERN?

Yes! We can see that 3 is half of 6 and 4 is half of 8.

In the cycle of 4 the 180 degree line runs from 2, in the cycle
of 10 it runs from 5 and in the cycle of 12 it runs from 6.

So we could make up any cycle of even numbers, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18, etc. and the bottom row (360 degree line) would contain
numbers that are the cycle number times the triangular numbers in
order and the 180 degree line would contain numbers that are 1/2 the
cycle number times the squares in order.

                                                                        261
(There is one even cycle I have not done. I leave it up to you
to figure out what it is and do it. It is the easiest cycle of all to
figure. Like I said in one of my earlier books, you do not have to go
way up in numbers to prove things. You can usually start at the
bottom of the ladder and if it works at the bottom of the ladder it
will usually work at the top.)



Chapter 5--Proof Of Cons truction

So, what have we proved with all this?

The fact that each cycle's 360 degree line contains numbers that
are the cycle's number times the triangular numbers in order is
pretty much proof that all these cycles are constructed in the same
way, the Hexagon (the cycle of six), the Square of Nine (which in
this case is really the Octagon, the cycle of eight) and all the
others that we could make with the same method.

The fact that the 180 degree line contains numbers that are made
up of squares times 1/2 the cycle numbers is just further proof by
PATTERN that these cycles are constructed in the same way.

If you want some other proof, look at the 180 degrees of some of
the other numbers on the "Square of Nine" chart. See how 3 is 180
degrees of 7. Now look at the first column of numbers in this:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

4 is 180 degrees of 8. Move up 1 from 4 to 3 and move up 1 from
8 to 7. Now move up 1 from 3 which is 2 and move up 1 from 7 which is
6. Now check your "Square of Nine" Chart and see where 2 and 6 are
located.

Do we need any further proof on the construction of the "Square
of Nine" or the Octagon Chart (the cycle of eight) and the cycle of
six or the Hexagon Chart.

For those of you who still insist on calling the Octagon chart
the "Square of Nine" chart, check the angles!

This chart is divided into 45 degree angles and subdivided into
22.5 degree angles. There are eight 45 degree angles in 360 degrees.

The Hexagon chart is divided into 60 degree angles and
subdivided into 30 degree angles. Since their construction is the
same then we would have to call the "Square of Nine" an Octagon chart
                                                                        262
if we call the cycle of six a Hexagon chart.

Nine divided into 360 is 40 and there are no 40 degree angles on
the "Square of Nine" chart.

We will see later that another name, more descriptive, can be
used for the Square of Nine or the Cycle of Eight. And also for the
Hexagon Chart!

But for now let's move on to the questions raised at the
beginning. The question or questions were which charts are
constructed alike and which are different.



Chapter 6--Cons truction of the Square of Four

Let's look at Gann's Square of Four. For many, many years I
believed that the construction of this chart was like the Square of
Nine chart.

Why?

The numbers seemed to be the same PATTERN but just ran in
different directions.

We can see that the odd squares run down on an angle in the
Square of Nine and the even squares run up an angle in the Square of
Nine.

In the Square of 4 they run across the page.

We can see that 3, 13, 31, etc. run down the page in the Square
of Four and on the Square of Nine they run on a 45 degree angle.
There are many more examples and I'm sure you have looked at this
from time to time.

In my book " On the Square" I noted how that numbers running on
an angle on the Square of Nine or Cycle of Eight had the difference
of 8 and would expect that in a "Cycle of Eight."

If we look at 3, 13, 31, we see that 13 minus 3 is 10 and 31
minus 13 is 18 and the difference between 18 and 10 is 8. Each time
the number on this line is 8 more than the previous number.

And we also see that on the Square of 4. Look at the numbers
going up on an angle 1, 6, 19, 40.

The differences in the numbers are:

5, 13, 21

And the difference between these numbers is 8. (5 from 13 is 8
and 13 from 21 is 8)

                                                                       263
So from all this I had assumed for many years that the Square of
Four and the Square of Nine were constructed from the same PATTERN
and the Hexagon was the "oddball," as far as construction was
concerned.

But now we have already seen that the Square of Nine and the
Hexagon are constructed in the same manner and have proved it by
checking the 360 degree line on each and the 180 degree line on each.

If we check the Square of Four 360 degree line we find that it
contains the numbers 4, 16, 36, 64, etc.

We have already done a "Cycle of Four" using the same method
that was used to make the Cycle of Eight and the Cycle of Six.

When I reached this point I decided to put down the numbers in
the same way that I made the Cycle of Four and see what I could do
with it.

This was my cycle of four:
                                    1     6     15   28    45
                                    2     8     18   32    50
                                    3     10    21   36    55
                                    4     12    24   40    60

Using that as I guide I tried to made up something so that the
numbers would come out as they do on the Square of Four.

So I put down these numbers:
                                    1     0     0    0     0
                                    2     0     0    0     0
                                    3     0     0    0     0
                                    4     16    36   64    100

Then I filled in the blanks. Can you do it before looking below?

I needed to put in numbers in the second column so that when I
was done I would have 16.

In the Cycle of Four I had used numbers with a difference of 2
so here I used the difference of 3.
                                    1   7     0     0    0
                                    2   10 0        0    0
                                    3   13 0        0    0
                                    4   16 0        0    0
And that came out right.

Can you guess what difference I would need in the next column?

With some experimentation I found that the next column would
work if I used a difference of 5.
                                  1    7     21 0      0
                                                                        264
                                    2     10   26    0    0
                                    3     13   31    0    0
                                    4     16   36    0    0

And then it was easy for me to see what was going on!

Do you see it now? Can you supply the difference in numbers for
the next column? If you said 7 you are right!

                                    1     7    21    43   0
                                    2     10   26    50   0
                                    3     13   31    57   0
                                    4     16   36    64   0

And of course the next column would have a difference of 9.

                                    1     7    21    43   73
                                    2     10   26    50   82
                                    3     13   31    57   91
                                    4     16   36    64   100

The 360 degree line on the Square of Four chart are made up of
the even squares. But they are also made up of something else. They
are 4 times the squares in order!

Let's look at that:

4x1 = 4
4x4 = 16
4x9 =36
4x16=64

And then it dawned on me. Maybe you have already figured it out.

Why is the 360 degree line of the Cycle of Four made up of
numbers which are 4 times the triangular numbers in order and why is
the 360 degree line of the Square of Four chart made up of numbers
that are 4 times the natural squares in order?

Let's look again at the way we constructed both the Cycle of
Four and the Square of Four. This time I will place over the top the
numbers that were added to each column.

                                    1     2    3     4    5
                                    1     6    15    28   45
                                    2     8    18    32   50
                                    3     10   21    36   55
                                    4     12   24    40   60

                                    1     3    5     7    9

                                                                       265
                                     1     7     21     43   73
                                     2     10    26     50   82
                                     3     13    31     57   91
                                     4     16    36     64   100

Look at the numbers over each column that I have put in blue.

These are the "differences" in the numbers in each column. These
are the numbers which are to be added in each column to provide the
answers in each column.

PATTERN?

Yes! In book VI, "The Triangular Numbers" I explained how
triangular numbers are made by simply adding the natural numbers in
order.

And the natural numbers in order are 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

Looking across the numbers in blue above the Cycle of 4 we can
see that they are 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So the answers we get on the 360
degree line are 4 times the triangular numbers in order.

In book IV, "On the Square" I told how the natural squares are
made from the natural numbers in order which are two units apart, 1,
3, 5, 7, also known as the odd numbers in order.

Looking across the numbers in quotes above the Square of Four we
can see that they are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.

So the answers we get on the 360 degree line of the Square of
Four are 4 times the squares in order!

Now to go back to the original question about the construction
of the Square of Nine, the Hexagon chart and the Square of Four.

Even though the Square of Four seems to be constructed the same
as the Square of Nine since the numbers are the same, but run in
different directions and since the difference in numbers on the
angles are the difference of 8, it is not constructed the same.

The Square of Nine or more appropriately called here the Cycle
of Eight is based on the triangular numbers, the Square of Four is
based on the squares.

So the Cycle of Eight (the Square of Nine) and the Hexagon chart
are constructed alike and the Square of Four is the "oddball" of the
three.



Chapter 7--Square of 6? Square of 8?

You might ask, could a Cycle of Six or a Cycle of Eight 8 be
                                                                       266
constructed in the same manner as the Square of Four, that is would
the 360 degree line be 6 times the natural squares in order or 8
times the natural squares in order?

The answer is yes!

You have seen how the Hexagon was built:
                                      1         2     3
                                      1         8     21
                                      2         10    24
                                      3         12    27
                                      4         14    30
                                      5         16    33
                                      6         18    36

We could go on out but that is far enough for the illustration.

And the numbers along the bottom, the 360 degree line, are made
by multiplying the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, etc. by 6.

Now let's make the difference in the columns the numbers that make
up the squares:

                                          1     3     5
                                          1     9     29
                                          2     12    34
                                          3     15    39
                                          4     18    44
                                          5     21    49
                                          6     24    54

Again we could carry this on out but we have enough for the
illustration.

We can see along the bottom row, our 360 degree line, that the
numbers are made up by multiplying 6 times the natural squares in
order 6x1=6, 6x4=24, 6x9=54, etc. Since the Square of Four based on 4
times the natural squares in order is called the Square of Four, this
then could be called the "Square of Six".

The same thing could be done with the number 8. I will let you
do that on your own as an exercise.

In Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers" I showed how various figures
could be made by addition of numbers.

I showed how to make triangular numbers, squares and other
figures. The next figure after the square is the pentagon. Pentagon
numbers are made by adding numbers that are three units in difference
starting with one. So the numbers that are used to make the pentagon
are 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.

                                                                        267
So your next question might be: Can we make a cycle using these
numbers? The answer is yes. We can take the number 6 again for
illustration.
Over the top we will put the numbers that are used to make the
pentagons.

                                            1   4     7
                                            1   10    37
                                            2   14    44
                                            3   18    51
                                            4   22    58
                                            5   26    65
                                            6   30    72

Again the 360 degree line runs along the bottom. Lets look at
the last number there. It is 72.

We can see that the third term of a pentagon is 12 (1+4+7).

And 6x12 is 72. So it works.

If we started adding numbers (from 1) which are 3 units apart,
1, 4, 7, 10, 13, etc. stopping at any point we wanted to and
multiplied our answer by 6 we would get a number which would be on
the 360 degree line from 6.

We could call this the "Pentagon of Six."

This can be done with any of our other numbers, 4, 8, 10, 12,
14, etc. Or for that matter, we could use the odd numbers and have a
"Pentagon of Three," a "Pentagon of Five," etc.

And we can see why it works. As I told you earlier, making the
Cycle of Six starting with 6 and adding 12 and then 18, etc. is the
same as saying:

1x6+2x6+3x6+4x6=60 or 1+2+3+4=10 and 10x6 is 60 like on the
Hexagon.

If we wanted to do squares we could say:

1x6+3x6+5x6+7x6+9x6=150 or 1+3+5+7+9=25 and 25x6=150.

If we wanted to do it using the pentagon numbers we could say:

1x6+4x6+7x6+10x6=132 or 1+4+7+10=22 and 22x6=132.

And cycles could be made of numbers that at 4 units apart, 5
units apart, etc.




                                                                       268
Chapter 8--The "Square" of 12

Earlier I mentioned a regular square, the square of 12 and its
construction. In the chapter heading I put the "Square" of 12 to
bring attention to it since it is not like the Square of Four, that
is, its construction is not like that of the Square of Four.

How is it different from the others? We could say the same of
any other "regular" square. How is it different from the others. Lets
put down a "regular" square of six.

By regular square I mean those squares that a person would make
normally if asked to make a square of numbers. That is, it's
construction would "not" be like Gann's Square of Four.

So let's put down a "regular" square of six.

                                   1     7     13   19   25    31
                                   2     8     14   20   26    32
                                   3     9     15   21   27    33
                                   4     10    16   22   28    34
                                   5     11    17   23   29    35
                                   6     12    18   24   30    36

We can see that the 360 degree line is simply the multiples of 6.

If we put over the top of this the difference in the numbers
that are used to make each column we have this:

                                   1     1     1    1    1     1
                                   1     7     13   19   25    31
                                   2     8     14   20   26    32
                                   3     9     15   21   27    33
                                   4     10    16   22   28    34
                                   5     11    17   23   29    35
                                   6     12    18   24   30    36

So what is the problem here? The problem is that in making the
other cycles we used the polygons: triangles (3-sided figures),
squares (4-sided figures) and pentagons (5-sided) figures from a book
by a very ancient writer.

In that book there was no "two-sided" figure which would be made
starting with 1 and adding O's to give us the next 1. This bothered
me for awhile.

(And it would have to be a two-sided figure if you think about
it since the triangular numbers are made from numbers which are 1-
unit apart and squares from numbers 2-units apart. A polygon made
from numbers that are 0 units apart would have to be a two-sided
figure.

                                                                        269
I explained in Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers" that the
difference in the numbers used to make a polygon is 2 less than the
sides of the figure. The square, a four sided figure, is made from
numbers that are 2 units apart and 2 is two less than the four sides.

A triangular number is made from numbers that are 1 unit apart
and 1 is 2 less than the three sides. If we make a figure from
numbers that have a difference of 0, then 0 is 2 less than a two-
sided figure.)

As I said before the ancient writer that came up with all this
did not show a two-sided figure and that bothered me for awhile.

But never fear! I stumbled on the answer as we will see later
on.

But first, let's move on to the magic squares and see if we can
find Gann's Magic Square.



Chapter 9--Finding the Magic Squares

My first encounter with Magic Squares was in a 1965 edition of
the Encyclopedia Britannica (I have read about 1/3 of that edition).
You will probably find Magic Squares in more modern versions of the
encyclopedia, but they might be listed under games or something like
that.

I don't know if all encyclopedias have articles on Magic
Squares, but you may want to check out the subject at your library.

The definition of a magic square as given in the encyclopedia is
"an arrangement of numbers in the form of a square so that every
column, every row, and each of the two diagonals add up alike, this
sum being called the constant. These squares are of very great
antiquity and appear to have been known from very ancient times in
China and India."

So let's look at a simple square, the square of 3.

                                           1     4   7
                                           2     5   8
                                           3     6   9

As you can see the rows and columns don't add to the same
amount. Yes the diagonals do add to the same, but the rows and
columns don't.

So, let's rearrange the numbers:

                                           8     1   6

                                                                        270
                                            3       5        7
                                            4       9        2

Now you can see that each row, column and diagonal add to 15.
And that is a magic square.

Let's do an even square, the square of 4:

                                       1        5       9        13
                                       2        6       10       14
                                       3        7       11       15
                                       4        8       12       16

Again the diagonals add to the same. But the rows and columns don't.

So let's rearrange the numbers:

                                        16       3       2       13
                                         5      10      11        8
                                         9       6       7       12
                                         4      15      14        1

This particular arrangement of numbers can be seen in Albrecht
Durer's "Melancholy" and the numbers in the middle lower cells 15 and
14 is the date of the painting 1514. It is not known whether this was
intentional or just coincidence.

This painting can be seen in some encyclopedias and other
places. It is full of geometrical, astronomical and mathematical
figures. Numerous people have tried to figure out the meaning of the
painting, but never have. You might want to give it a look.

There are a number of ways to make magic squares and I will not
go into that here. If you are interested in their construction you
should look at the encyclopedia.

Suffice it to say that they are made according to "orders."

Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) constructed squares of the orders
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were associated with the seven
astrological planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury
and the Moon.

I have not read his work, but would like to get hold of a copy
of it if any reader of this work knows anything about it.

What caught my eye was that the arrangements of the planets as
given above is the same arrangement shown by Karl Anderson in his
"Astrology of the Old Testament," for the construction of the
planetary hours. That is, assigning each hour of the day to a planet.

Also catching my eye was the fact that the order of six was

                                                                        271
associated with the Sun and the order of nine was associated with the
Moon. In Anderson's book he associated the number six with the Sun
and the number nine with the Moon. I spoke about this in my Book X--
"Cubes and the Hexagon."

Let's move on.

Using any magic square, can you guess what the numbers will add
to in any row, column are diagonal?

Look back at the square of 3 (3x3). You can see that the sum in
any row, column or diagonal is 15.

If you had a square of 7 (7x7) what would be the sum of any
given row, column or diagonal?

In the article I read in the encyclopedia on magic squares it
did not say, but I figured it out for myself. And I figured it from
something I already knew and by now you probably know it to.

Let's look at that square of 3 again.

                                           8     1     6
                                           3     5     7
                                           4     9     2

We can see that each row, column and diagonal sum to 15. Does
that give you a clue?

Since there are 3 rows totaling 15 each then the sum of all the
rows must be 45. Since each column totals 15 and there are 3 columns
then the sum of all the columns must be 45.

So the total of the whole square is 45. Sound familiar?

Yes! If we add 1 through 9 we get 45 and 45 is the triangle of
9! And since there are 3 numbers in each row, column, etc. we divide
45 by 3 and can see that each row, column, etc. is 15.

So, back to the question, in the magic square of 7, what would
be the sum of a row, column or diagonal?

Yes, it would be the triangle of 49 (7X7) divided by 7 since
there are 7 columns and 7 rows. Adding 1 through 49 we get 1225.
Dividing by 7 we get 175. So each row, etc. of 7 numbers will add to
175.

The construction of the squares is not all that important here.
I am doing this just to give you the idea of what magic squares are
all about. Numbers are arranged in such a way that they form a
PATTERN.

Now, let's move on in our search for Gann's magic square. As I
mentioned above I have read about 1/3 of the 1965 edition of the

                                                                        272
Encyclopedia Britannica.

The reason I read the 1965 version was the fact that it was the
only version that the library had when I began searching through it
on anything about numbers, Masonry, astrology, astronomy and any
other subject I thought might help me in my Gann studies.

I also read several of the Time-Life books in the series
"Mysteries of the Unknown" on Masonry, astrology, etc.

There were also regular math books, geometry books and about
1200 pages of Josephus.

I also read a couple of Masonic books. (No, those books are not
found in the local library.)

Why was I looking at this stuff?

I was looking for anything that might give me a clue to Gann's
work which seems to be written under "veils." I hoped somewhere along
the line that I might find some reference to his circular charts, his
Square of Nine, his Square of 4, the Hexagon Chart, the square of 12
chart, anything that might give me a clue to his work.

Several years ago I had read in some of the commodity magazines
that Gann had brought the Square of Nine chart or the Square of Four
chart from overseas. Some claimed he brought it from Mesopotamia,
some from Egypt, some from India. etc.

He was supposed to have brought it to this country sometime in
the 1930's.

But there was no reason for him to have done that. One of his
charts was already in this country as early as 1912!

I had pretty much given up on my search, which had been going on
for about 10 years, when I happen to send off for a book on numbers.

There was quite a bit of interesting information on numbers in
the book, which was copyrighted in 1922. And there on the last page
was the information I had been looking for.

Here is a picture of a drawing in the back of that book.

                             11    12   13   14   15       16   17   18
                             10    8    9    10   11       12   13   19
                             9     7    5    6    7        8    14   20
                             8     6    4    2    3        9    15   21
                             7     5    3    1    4        10   16   22
                             6     4    2    1    12       11   17   23
                             5     3    2    1    20       19   18   24
                             4     3    2    1    28       27   26   25


                                                                          273
Can you identify it?

Maybe you can't. A friend of mine, a friend whom I have spoken
of before in these writings and who had been studying Gann long
before I started, looked at the drawing and could not identify it
either until I pointed out what it represented.

Have you got it yet?

It is Gann's Square of Four chart!

Like my friend you might have a little difficulty in making the
connection with the Square of Four chart at first.

For one thing it's 360 degree line runs down the page instead of
across. This is because the way the first four numbers are written
down. For another, the numbers run in the opposite direction. Gann's
Square of Four chart runs counter clockwise and this one runs
clockwise.

Probably one of the main difficulties for you and my friend is
the way the numbers end on the 360 degree line.

Let's check those 360 degree numbers starting with 4 just like
we would on Gann's Square of Four chart. The numbers are:

4, 12, 20, 28

PATTERN?

Yes, they are 4x1, 4x3, 4x5, 4x7

Remember 1+3+5+7 is the way squares are made and 4 times those
numbers is how the 360 degree line on the Square of Four are made.

Let's add those numbers from the 360 degree line above:

4
4+12=16
16+20=36
36+28=64

Now check your 360 degree line on the Square of Four chart. The
first four numbers are 4, 16, 36, 64!

So this chart is Gann's Square of Four chart!

We can see what the original writer did. He started with 1 and
counted until he got to the 360 degree line and came to 4. Unlike
Gann, who continued counting 5, 6, 7, etc., he simply started over
again with the number 1 and counted until he got to the 360 degree
line again. And then he started with 1 again, etc.

So let's take his chart and instead of laying it out as he did
                                                                       274
we will do it like Gann, but leave the numbers in the exact position
as he has them:

                              47   48   49   50   51    52   53       54
                              46   24   25   26   27    28   29       55
                              45   23   9    10   11    12   30       56
                              44   22   8    2    3     13   31       57
                              43   21   7    1    4     14   32       58
                              42   20   6    5    16    15   33       59
                              41   19   18   17   36    35   34       60
                              40   39   38   37   64    63   62       61

Now let's turn it around so that his 360 degree line runs across
the page instead of up and down.

                              40   41   42   53   44    45   46       47
                              39   19   20   21   22    23   24       48
                              38   18   6    7    8     9    25       49
                              37   17   5    1    2     10   26       50
                              64   36   16   4    3     11   27       51
                              63   35   15   14   13    12   28       52
                              62   34   33   32   31    30   29       53
                              61   60   59   58   57    56   55       54

Now we can see that the chart runs in just the same way as Gann's except
it runs clockwise.

You should note that Gann could have done the same thing.

You will also notice the astrological symbols which run from 1
to 12 with the numbers 1 to 4 inside it. I would assume that the
numbers 1 to 4 represent the seasons and the numbers 1 to 12 are the
12 signs of the zodiac or the 12 months in the year.

Now, why do I believe that this is a magic square?

Because the writer said so!



Chapter 10--The 1922 Book

Since this writer's description is only part of a much larger
description I will make this a chapter to itself so you can refer
back to it to see how much was left out of the original. The quotes
here is exactly like they were in the book. All capitalization,
punctuation, spellings, etc. has been left the way it was in the
book:

"THE MAGI DISCOVERED THAT THE ARITHMETICAL

OF THE SUN AND MOON AND THE EARTH WERE IDENTICAL
WITH THOSE WHICH SOLVED THE GEOMETRICAL

"Occupying themselves with both arithmetical numbers and

so built up the exact science of arithmetic, concerning the origin of

"A few minutes' study forces one to the realization that here is
to be found the most remarkable Magic Square of antiquity, a

"Naturally, acquaintance of the Pythagorean system of
arithmetical metaphyics fits the possessor for readier perceptions
than are possible without it, but enough is readily apparent to show
to even the casual observer the extraordinary character of the
combination."



Chapter 11--The 1912 Book

The 1922 book led me to another book, written in 1912. What had
been said in the 1922 book was just a brief sketch of the 1912 book.

So let's look at what he really said. Once again I will put it
just like he had it, capitalization, punctuation, spelling, etc. The
only change I made was to break up some of the long paragraphs into
some shorter ones for easier reading. I will let you read one long
passage from that work and then we will go back through it for some
comments:

"THE MAGI DISCOVERED THAT THE ARITHMETICAL NUMBERS
EXPRESSED BY THE CHRONOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE SUN
AND MOON TO THE EARTH WERE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE WHICH
SOLVED THE GEOMETRICAL PROBLEM OF THE SQUARING OF THE
CIRCLE.

"Occupying themselves with both arithmetical numbers and
geometrical proportions, they discovered that the precision of the
latter was an infallible guide to the application of the former, and
so built up the exact science of arithmetic, concerning the origin of
which there have been so many fruitless speculations.

"For this purpose they employed from the very first the division
of the square by the cross, finding two systems of progression, each
with a definite value and purpose and blending at frequent intervals,
one employing a single square as its unit or nucleus and building up
around it on a progressive ratio of 1-9-25, etc., the other dividing
a square by a cross into a group of four central compartments and
building upon a consequent ratio of 4-16-36, etc. (See Forty Seventh
Problem), counting not only upon the total sums procured by each
additional encircling row of squares, but the number in each row
                                                                        276
required to complete the circuit.

"It is from this latter scale that the three systems of notation
which have reigned throughout the world, the Quaternary (2--4--8--16
etc.,) employed by the Semites and the Chinese, the Decimal and the
Duodecimal (by dozens) are derived.

"While the digital system of "fives" agrees with the Decimal
system, it will be clearly perceived as this is examined into, that
it was by no means its origin.

"In addition to the wonderful properties of the foregoing system
was discovered a similar notation, built up by sub-division of the
Equilateral Triangle by other equilateral triangles.

"The smallest number of Equilateral Triangles into which any one
could be divided being four, the progression was found to be
precisely the same as that of a square, starting from a central group
of four, inasmuch as by numbering the Equilateral Triangles from left
to right the last figure of each row always expresses the "square "
of the downward counting number of the row, while each total is the
same as the total of a square figure of an equal number of divisions
per side.

"This coincidence was in itself enough to place the Equilateral
Triangle on a parity with the square as a source of "sacred" numbers,
but the multiple Equilateral Triangle, was discovered to embody many
extraordinary arithmetical properties of its own not the least
important of which was the development in the up-pointing Equilateral
Triangles of the first four rows, of the famous TETRAX appropriated
by Pythagoras as the basis of his own philosophical system.

"By the time this point was reached, the Magi had achieved great
dexterity in demonstrating the manifold yet always orderly and
mathematically exact relations between the various geometrical
figures of equilateral proportions and the circle, executing
elaborate calculations by horizontal, perpendicular and diagonal
intersections of given squares which exhibited the results in
pictures as well as sums.

"The discovery of the Tetrax, the sum of the first four digits
equalling the whole number--1+2+3+4=10, (Expressed by the four angles
of the Cross), and the infinity of multiplications by nine reducible
to nine (9x9=81 etc.,) encouraged experiments in similar operations
with the sums of numbers, so that certain numbers obtained
significance not only with reference to their own properties but as
the sums of dissimilar numbers added together.

"As the sum of 1 to 4 was 10, so the sum of 1 to 7 was 28, the
sum of 1 to 8, 36, and the sum of 1 to 16, 136, all figures which
came to have great significance in the Magian system.

"These priests, prophets, astronomers and astrologers, gradually
came to concern themselves with everything which could be accounted
for through correspondence of form, number, or proportion and their
                                                                        277
great power was derived from their ability to successfully
demonstrate a relation of all which came under their range of
observation to the heavenly bodies.

"That the mystical should dominate in their appreciations is no
more than natural. We shall see that without any charge of
superstition they had a right to be awe stricken at some of their
discoveries and we shall before we have finished our examination,
rather ask if we have not the same right to be held in wonderment
ourselves.

"The most wonderful of all their achievements was their
determination of the almost supernatural qualities attached to the
number 64 (sixty-four) which set out according to their system in
chequered squares, was undoubtedly the so-called "Mosaic pavement."

"This is stated by the Bible, (Exodus XXIV, 10) to have been
revealed to Moses and the Seventy Elders upon Mount Sinai, where the
congregation of Israel received God's direct command to employ it as
a PATTERN for the plan of their Tabernacle and it also reaches us
from the ancient Babylonians, Chinese and Egyptians, as the familiar
"draught", or Chess-Board.

"The number 64 is the heart of the entire Magian system, because
around it and its central "four" the Tetrax, revolves the whole
numerical and geometrical system, to which the Magi sought to reduce
the universe and the centre of that is THE CROSS.

"It is essential that we do not forget in the midst of these
arithmetical speculations, that the units with which we are dealing,
are for the most part expressed by numbered squares.

"The reason for the selection of sixty-four, as the Divine
number by the Magi, resided in the ascertained fact that upon the
reduction of their premises to the test of numbers, as expressed
either geometrically, or arithmetically, sixty-four proved to be the
determinating factor of each and every one.

"Here are a few of the considerations involved: The chief
significance of the number 64 aside from that of it being the cube of
four, resides in its being the sum of 36 and 28.

"These numbers, according to the Magi, expressed the Sun and the
Moon, respectively because the, by them computed, Solar year was one
of Three Hundred and Sixty days, or 10 times 36, while the more
closely computed Lunar year was one of thirteen times Twenty-eight,
or Three Hundred and Sixty-four.

"These details may be verified by consulting any encyclopedic
article, or book upon the Calendar, ancient and modern. The
discrepancy between the figures quoted and the true year amounts to
five days, in one case and one in the other, but these lost days were
utilized as feast days in Solar or Lunar honor and compensated for by
intercalary years and the employment of cycles in the course of which
all irregularities righted themselves.
                                                                        278
"The real reason of this approximation, however, was to bring
the annual revolution of the universe into accord with the Quadrature
of the Circle.

A curious corroboration of this fact exists to this day in the
ancient Jewish celebration of c'Hanukah, a festival which so closely
coincides with Christmastide that there can be no doubt of its Solar
inspiration.

"The rite involves the burning of a given number of candles
during eight days, starting with one on the first day, two on the
second and so on to the eighth day, when one additional candle called
the Shammas candle (Babylonian Shamash, the Sun) is placed in front.

"The significance of this scheme is entirely numerical. It is
the addition of the digits 1 to 8, which we have already alluded to,
which produces the Solar number 36, that upon which the initiates of
the Pythagorean Mysteries were sworn to secrecy.

"The completed figure is that of an equilateral triangle, of
eight units to one side. The triangle again represents Adonai, or
Tammuz, in his Solar aspect and the eight "squared" by the
equilateral triangle is sixty-four. Thirty-six upward pointing and
twenty-eight downward pointing smaller triangles.

"On the final day, the addition of the single candle gives the
last row the value of nine, which is the diminutive of 36, leaving in
the background the full Lunar number of 28. This custom, which is
undoubtedly the origin of the lighted candles of the Christmas Tree,
must extend back to the remotest antiquity.

"The dimunition of 36 and 28 to 9 and 7 is a matter of relative
proportion as well as of number, the latter being the lowest factors
in which the same proportions are preserved and the lesson sought to
be inculcated is that nothing is too great to be brought within the
ken of human intellect by such reduction.

"There are not only one but two squarings of the circle. One in
which the perimeter, or length of line of a given circle is shown to
be equal to that of a given square. The second is the production of a
circle the contained area of which is equal to that contained in a
given square.

"The slight difference between the two circles which respond to
one and the same square is in favor of the former.

"To discover the significance of the relative values of 9 and 7
in this respect we must turn to the pyramid system of the ancient
Egyptians, who by the base line, sides, and vertical axes of these
monuments expressed geometrical relations.

"The great Pyramid of Gizeh in this manner expressed the first
named problem, in its base of 5 and sides of 4, (5 plus 4 equals 9),
while the other, if expressed in the same manner would call for base
                                                                        279
of 4 and sides of 3, (4 plus 3 equals 7.)

The vertical axis is in each case the radius of the correct
circle while the base line of the pyramid is that of the square.

"The same proportions, differently expressed, are the basis of
the wonderful Pythagorean problem of the square on the hypothenuse,
which conceals almost the entire Magian system.

"The agreement of 7x9--63, also comes so close to the united
number as to nearly complete a numerical circle, 4x7+4x9=7x9+1=64.

"On the "Chess-board" system of numeration, 4--12--20--28, we
have 4+12+20 presenting the number 36, as a "square" of 6 (6^)
surrounded by 28 smaller squares.

"Another row of 36, around, gives us a total of ONE HUNDRED, the
"square" of 10 and origin of the decimal system. Further instances
abound in other and widely varying demonstrations.

"It was certainly among the Magi that those interesting
numerical puzzles known as "Magic Squares" had their rise. Ostensibly
the idea was to so align arithmetical numbers, displaying within a
certain number of squares, that added in every sense, they would
produce the same sum.

"The idea of the "Magic Square" was not, however, as might be
supposed, due to human ingenuity, but is attributable entirely to a
natural property of numbers, beginning with the zero (0), rows of
which, in sequence, and aligned so as to constitute horizontal and
perpendicular series, invariably offer an identical addition in every
sense, thus constituting the ILU figure arithmetically as well as
geometrically.

"No more perfect example of this principle could be offered than
the thirty-five squares of our familiar monthly calendar, which
always bring the same figures into perpendicular alignment.

"This calendar designed to exhibit, numerically tabulated with
relation to the month, four weeks of seven days, together with the
three, or four, remaining to complete the mensual period is founded
on a most curious Cabalistic "square", involving the elements of a
table of multiplication, subtraction, division and addition, through
the prime factor 7.

"The number of squares involved is only thirty-five, but a
remarkable metaphysical hint is given in the upper left hand square
of nine figures, when the month begins on a Monday.

"The sums of the cruciform additions are each 24, three of them
1--8--15, 7--8--9, 2--8--14, but the remaining fourth is 8--16,
clearly indicating an unrecorded thirtysixth figure--a zero, the
symbol of the "Non-being-Being", which sustains such an important
role in the theosophy of the ancient world.

                                                                        280
"Upon the 35 square the cipher "0" does not exist until the
relation between the 8 and the 16 shows that a symbol for non-
existence must be placed in advance of the figure "1", to complete
the divine symbol.

"The "0" possesses the same significance with reference to the
"X" of 8--0, 7--1, and the cross of 80 of which the 2 is the apex.
Thus the position of the zero "0" is shown clearly to precede "1"
instead of following "9" and to demonstrate metaphysically the
existence of non-existence prior to the development of "1" the
Pythagorean "Monad", or first manifestation of existence.

"The square thus symbolizes the "Non-being-Being", the Trinity,
the Circle and Diameter. Beginning and End, 7+0=7, the Lunar number,
8+1=9, the Solar Number. 1--0, "Ten", the Tetrax, also symbolized by
1--2--3--4, 1--7=28 (Lunar), 1--8=36 (Solar) and 7+8+1+0=16, the
"Tetragrammaton".

"This is the true Cabalistic interpretation of the beginning of
the Divine labor of Creation on the first day of the week, followed
by a cessation of labor and repose upon the recurring period of the
lunar septenary, which is the inspiration of the whole arrangement.

"The amplification of the diagram to forty compartments, for the
sake of demonstrating the Cabalistic relation of the numbers, one to
another, in no way obscures its identification, as the internal
measure of fleeting time.

"Its base of eight squares and vertical axis of five squares
will at once show it to be another of the mysteries embodied in the
Great Pyramid of Gizeh.

"A most curious example of the Magic Square, from which is said
to have been derived the Jewish appellation of the eternal Elohim, is
a combined Magic Square and anagram of the Hebrew form of the word
ALHIM, having a numerical expression of 40, 10, 5, 3, 1, or 4, 1, 5,
3, 1.

"Arranged in a square of 5x5, it reads as here exhibited:

                                     3     1    4     1     5
                                     1     4    1     5     3
                                     4     1    5     3     1
                                     1     5    3     1     4
                                     5     3    1     4     5


"It will be seen that the play is upon the numbers 3, 4 and 5,
that the word ALHIM reads from the bottom to the top and left to
right as a cross. The centre is a Sun-Cross adding 9 in either sense,
in the midst of a 9 square of 28, while the top horizontal and left
perpendicular lines are 3--1--4--1--5 (decimally 3.1415), which is
the mathematical formula of the II proportions. The central Cross
also supplies another circle squaring formula to the initiate.
                                                                        281
"There are several other Magic Squares extant which are of self-
evident Magian origin, but none transcending in vital interest that
which, way back at the dawn of civilization was deemed worthy to
serve as a plan of the Heavens and key to the Firmament.

THE CELESTIAL SQUARE

"That the discovery of the arithmetical qualities of this square
antedated the usage to which it was put there is not the shadow of a
doubt.

"The latter is altogether arbitrary. Scientists have puzzled
their brains for ages as to why there were just twelve signs of the
Zodiac, precursurs of the twelve gods of Olympus, the twelve tribes
of Israel and the twelve Apostles, but so far as we can inform
ourselves, no wonderment has ever been expressed that there should be
four seasons instead of two, why the Mexicans should have adopted a
Zodiac of twenty animal figures and why the Chinese should have taken
an inner Zodiac of twelve figures and an outer of twenty-eight
constellations (the Astrological "Houses of the Moon"), together with
a cycle of twelve years.

"The application is world wide, from Pekin to Peru, westwardly,
but the correspondence with the Magian cosmogonic square of Sixty-
four (4--12--20--28) was too strong to escape attention and the
temptation to seek to discover if it was more than accidental,
pressing.

"Recent experiments with the Magic Squares offered the
suggestion of consecutively numbering the squares of each row
according to their Zodiacal sequence, commencing with the central "4"
and giving the number "1" to the first of the Seasons, the Spring
Equinoctial. Directly beneath this would come Aries, placing Taurus,
the second sign of the western Zodiac in the proper corner.

"Commencing the following two rows immediately below in turn, in
each case brought the Equinoctial and Solstitial signs into their
proper corners:

                                            E     S
                                            N     W

with the following result:

                             11   12   13    14   15   16    17   18
                             10   8    9     10   11   12    13   19
                             9    7    5     6    7    8     14   20
                             8    6    4     2    3    9     15   21
                             7    5    3     1    4    10    16   22
                             6    4    2     1    12   11    17   23
                             5    3    2     1    20   19    18   24
                             4    3    2     1    28   27    26   25
                                                                        282
"A few minutes' study forces one to the realization that here is
to be found the most remarkable Magic Square of antiquity, a
conviction which hours of experiment only serve to heighten.

"Naturally, acquaintance of the Pythagorean system of
arithmetical metaphyics fits the possessor for readier perceptions
than are possible without it, but enough is readily apparent to show
to even the casual observer the extraordinary character of the
combination."

(As you can see there was quite a lot left out of the first
author's description of this material. Go back and see what he said
and then look at all the material in between.)

In the next chapter we will go through this bit by bit and see
what we can pick up from it.



Chapter 12--Looking at the Material

So let's look at the material bit by bit:

"THE MAGI DISCOVERED THAT THE ARITHMETICAL
NUMBERS EXPRESSED BY THE CHRONOLOGICAL
RELATIONS OF THE SUN AND MOON TO THE EARTH
WERE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE WHICH SOLVED THE
GEOMETRICAL PROBLEM OF THE SQUARING OF THE
CIRCLE.

(Note: In the 1922 book this was misquoted. The 1922 book said
"relations of the sun and moon and the earth" and you will notice
here the quote is "relations of the sun and moon "to" the earth.")

(No, I have not yet solved what he means here by the relations
of the sun and moon, etc. to the squaring of the circle. Gann talks
about the squaring of the circle in several places.)


"For this purpose they employed from the very first the division
of the square by the cross, finding two systems of progression, each
with a definite value and purpose and blending at frequent intervals,
one employing a single square as its unit or nucleus and building up
around it on a progressive ratio of 1-9-25, etc., the other dividing
a square by a cross into a group of four central compartments and
building upon a consequent ratio of 4-16-36, etc. (See Forty Seventh
Problem), counting not only upon the total sums procured by each
additional encircling row of squares, but the number in each row
required to complete the circuit.

"It is from this latter scale that the three systems of notation
which have reigned throughout the world, the Quaternary (2--4--8--16
etc.,) employed by the Semites and the Chinese, the Decimal and the
                                                                        283
Duodecimal (by dozens) are derived.

"While the digital system of "fives" agrees with the Decimal
system, it will be clearly perceived as this is examined into, that
it was by no means its origin.

(Here you can see that the author has described both the Square
of Nine chart (one employing a single square as its unit or nucleus
and building up around it on a progressive ratio of 1-9-25, etc.

(And the Square of Four Chart (the other dividing a square by a
cross into a group of four central compartments and building upon a
consequent ratio of 4-16-36, etc.

(And both of these were described in a publication copyrighted
in 1912 in the United States some 30 years before Gann supposedly
brought them from Mesopotamia, India, etc.!

(I will not argue the fact that Gann did bring them from
overseas. Maybe he did. But it was not necessary since they were
already in this country and since both Gann and the author of this
material were Masons I would imagine that Gann knew about his work.)

Let's continue with some more quotes from the author's work:

"In addition to the wonderful properties of the foregoing system
was discovered a similar notation, built up by sub-division of the
Equilateral Triangle by other equilateral triangles.

"The smallest number of Equilateral Triangles into which any one
could be divided being four, the progression was found to be
precisely the same as that of a square, starting from a central group
of four, inasmuch as by numbering the Equilateral Triangles from left
to right the last figure of each row always expresses the "square "
of the downward counting number of the row, while each total is the
same as the total of a square figure of an equal number of divisions
per side.

(Since there is one triangle on the top and three under that and
five under that, etc. we now know that if we number them left to
right then in the right hand side we will always have a square
number, 1, 4, 9, etc.)

"This coincidence was in itself enough to place the Equilateral
Triangle on a parity with the square as a source of "sacred" numbers,
but the multiple Equilateral Triangle, was discovered to embody many
extraordinary arithmetical properties of its own not the least
important of which was the development in the up-pointing Equilateral
Triangles of the first four rows, of the famous TETRAX appropriated
by Pythagoras as the basis of his own philosophical system.

(Here he is talking about the triangles stacked on top of each
other, 1 on 2 and 2 on 3, much in the same way I described the
stacking of cans in a store display to form a triangle in my Book VI-
"The Triangular Numbers.")
                                                                        284
"By the time this point was reached, the Magi had achieved great
dexterity in demonstrating the manifold yet always orderly and
mathematically exact relations between the various geometrical
figures of equilateral proportions and the circle, executing
elaborate calculations by horizontal, perpendicular and diagonal
intersections of given squares which exhibited the results in
pictures as well as sums.

"The discovery of the Tetrax, the sum of the first four digits
equalling the whole number--1+2+3+4=10, (Expressed by the four angles
of the Cross), and the infinity of multiplications by nine reducible
to nine (9x9=81 etc.,) encouraged experiments in similar operations
with the sums of numbers, so that certain numbers obtained
significance not only with reference to their own properties but as
the sums of dissimilar numbers added together.

(The Tetrax, or Tetractes as it is sometimes spelled, is that
series of 10 dots by Pythagorus which are placed in the form of a
triangle, one dot on top, two under that, etc. which can be shown
with triangles or even cans in a store!)

"As the sum of 1 to 4 was 10, so the sum of 1 to 7 was 28, the
sum of 1 to 8, 36, and the sum of 1 to 16, 136, all figures which
came to have great significance in the Magian system.

(And here we see that without really saying it he is telling us
that these are triangular numbers.)

"These priests, prophets, astronomers and astrologers, gradually
came to concern themselves with everything which could be accounted
for through correspondence of form, number, or proportion and their
great power was derived from their ability to successfully
demonstrate a relation of all which came under their range of
observation to the heavenly bodies.

"That the mystical should dominate in their appreciations is no
more than natural. We shall see that without any charge of
superstition they had a right to be awe stricken at some of their
discoveries and we shall before we have finished our examination,
rather ask if we have not the same right to be held in wonderment
ourselves.

"The most wonderful of all their achievements was their
determination of the almost supernatural qualities attached to the

chequered squares, was undoubtedly the so-called "Mosaic pavement."

"This is stated by the Bible, (Exodus XXIV, 10) to have been

from the ancient Babylonians, Chinese and Egyptians, as the familiar

                                                                        285
(Exodus XXIV, 10 says "And they saw the God of Israel: and there
was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and
as it were the body of heaven in his clearness." How this is seen as
a chess board, I don't know. I also don't know how it was used as a
plan for the tabernacle. It requires some more study.)

"The number 64 is the heart of the entire Magian system, because
around it and its central "four" the Tetrax, revolves the whole
numerical and geometrical system, to which the Magi sought to reduce
the universe and the centre of that is THE CROSS.

"It is essential that we do not forget in the midst of these
arithmetical speculations, that the units with which we are dealing,
are for the most part expressed by numbered squares.

"The reason for the selection of sixty-four, as the Divine
number by the Magi, resided in the ascertained fact that upon the
reduction of their premises to the test of numbers, as expressed
either geometrically, or arithmetically, sixty-four proved to be the
determinating factor of each and every one.

"Here are a few of the considerations involved: The chief
significance of the number 64 aside from that of it being the cube of
four, resides in its being the sum of 36 and 28.

(And by now you have probably figured out that 28 is the
triangle of 7 and 36 is the triangle of 8 and when you add any two
successive triangular numbers as explained in my Book VI-"The
Triangular Numbers" you get a square. In this case the square is 64,
the square of 8).

"These numbers, according to the Magi, expressed the Sun and the
Moon, respectively because the, by them computed, Solar year was one
of Three Hundred and Sixty days, or 10 times 36, while the more
closely computed Lunar year was one of thirteen times Twenty-eight,
or Three Hundred and Sixty-four.

"These details may be verified by consulting any encyclopedic
article, or book upon the Calendar, ancient and modern. The
discrepancy between the figures quoted and the true year amounts to
five days, in one case and one in the other, but these lost days were
utilized as feast days in Solar or Lunar honor and compensated for by
intercalary years and the employment of cycles in the course of which
all irregularities righted themselves.

"The real reason of this approximation, however, was to bring
the annual revolution of the universe into accord with the Quadrature
of the Circle.

"A curious corroboration of this fact exists to this day in the
ancient Jewish celebration of c'Hanukah, a festival which so closely
coincides with Christmastide that there can be no doubt of its Solar
inspiration.

"The rite involves the burning of a given number of candles
                                                                        286
during eight days, starting with one on the first day, two on the
second and so on to the eighth day, when one additional candle called
the Shammas candle (Babylonian Shamash, the Sun) is placed in front.

"The significance of this scheme is entirely numerical. It is
the addition of the digits 1 to 8, which we have already alluded to,
which produces the Solar number 36, that upon which the initiates of
the Pythagorean Mysteries were sworn to secrecy.

"The completed figure is that of an equilateral triangle, of
eight units to one side. The triangle again represents Adonai, or
Tammuz, in his Solar aspect and the eight "squared" by the
equilateral triangle is sixty-four. Thirty-six upward pointing and
twenty-eight downward pointing smaller triangles.

"On the final day, the addition of the single candle gives the
last row the value of nine, which is the diminutive of 36, leaving in
the background the full Lunar number of 28. This custom, which is
undoubtedly the origin of the lighted candles of the Christmas Tree,
must extend back to the remotest antiquity.

"The dimunition of 36 and 28 to 9 and 7 is a matter of relative
proportion as well as of number, the latter being the lowest factors
in which the same proportions are preserved and the lesson sought to
be inculcated is that nothing is too great to be brought within the
ken of human intellect by such reduction.

(What he has done here is reduce the 36 to 9 and the 28 to 7 by
dividing each by 4. The same ratio is retained.)

"There are not only one but two squarings of the circle. One in
which the perimeter, or length of line of a given circle is shown to
be equal to that of a given square. The second is the production of a
circle the contained area of which is equal to that contained in a
given square.

"The slight difference between the two circles which respond to
one and the same square is in favor of the former.

"To discover the significance of the relative values of 9 and 7
in this respect we must turn to the pyramid system of the ancient
Egyptians, who by the base line, sides, and vertical axes of these
monuments expressed geometrical relations.

"The great Pyramid of Gizeh in this manner expressed the first
named problem, in its base of 5 and sides of 4, (5 plus 4 equals 9),
while the other, if expressed in the same manner would call for base
of 4 and sides of 3, (4 plus 3 equals 7.)

"The vertical axis is in each case the radius of the correct
circle while the base line of the pyramid is that of the square.

(Let' look at what he means here. He shows pictures of two
pyramids. One is labeled the sun, the other is labeled the moon. The
one labeled the sun has a base of 5 and a side of 4 and he probably
                                                                        287
labels this the sun as 5 plus 4 is 9 and we saw how he reduced 36
(the number of the sun) to 9.

(First we will use his figures to get the "height" of the
pyramid. This is what he calls the vertical axis. Then we will use
that "height" as the radius of a circle.

(The hypotenuse is 4. So now we must find the two sides of a
right triangle so that when the sides are squared and added together
they equal the square on the hypotenuse which is 16.

(We only have the other number, the base, which is 5, so let's
go inside the pyramid and find the distance from the center to an
outside corner. If the base of the square is 5, then a diagonal going
through the center equals 5 times the square root of 2. The square
root of 2 is 1.4142135. And 5 times that is 7.0710627.

(So the diagonal of a square with a base of 5 is 7.0710627. But
remember we are trying to find the distance from the center of the
base out to one corner, so we divide 7.0710627 by 2 and get
3.5355313.

(Now we have the hypotenuse (the side of the pyramid) which is 4
and we have one of the legs of our right triangle which is 3.5355313.

(We now want to find the height of the pyramid which is a line
drawn from the center (or half point of that diagonal we just found
up to the apex where it joins the hypotenuse. We can do that by
squaring the hypotenuse and squaring the one leg of the right
triangle we have found and subtract them and take the square root.

(4 squared is 16. 3.5355313 squared is 12.499981. And 16 minus
12.499981 is 3.500019. And taking the square root of 3.500019 we get
1.8708337. And 1.8708337 is the height of the pyramid.

(Now let's do the other one where we have a base of 4 and a side
of 3. Added together they make 7 which is 28 divided by 4 as we saw
earlier.

(Again we need to find the height of the pyramid. Since the base
is 4, then the diagonal of the square is 4 times the square root of 2
or 5.656854 and half of that is 2.828427, which is the measurement
from the center of the pyramid out to one corner and forms one of the
legs of a right angle triangle whose hypotenuse is 3.

(Now we will square that leg and get 7.9999992. Then we square
the hypotenuse and get 9. Subtracting 7.9999992 from 9 we get
1.0000008. Taking the square root of 1.0000008 we get 1.0000003 which
is the height of the pyramid.

(So now let's use each of those heights to find the answers to
each of the problems of the squaring of the circle. The first height,
1.87, is to be used to find the circumference of a circle which
would equal the perimeter of a square which has a side of 5.
Therefore we are looking for a circumference which will equal 4x5
                                                                        288
(four sides, each side is 5) or 20.

(The formula for finding the circumference is 2xradiusxPI. So
2x1.87x3.14159=11.74. Whoops. Something is wrong here. That is not
even close to 20.

(So, let's do the one for the area. With a side of 5 the area of
the square is 25. So we are looking for a circle that has an area of
25. The height for this problem was 1. The formula for finding the
area of a circle is radius times radius times PI. So
1x1x3.14159=3.14159. Whoops again! That is no where near 25.

(So what is going on here? The problem is we took him at his
word that this was based on proportions of a pyramid and to find the
answers we had to go inside the pyramid and figure the height as
being from the center of the pyramid up to the apex.

(But let's look at it from a different way. Let's just look at
the two figures not as a three-demensional geometric figures, but as
two-demensional ones. That is, let's look at them simply as triangles
with two equal sides and a base.

(Let's do the first one again, the one where we are looking for
the perimeter. It has sides of 4 and a base of 5. Let's find the
height by drawing a line down from the apex which cuts the base in
two which gives as a triangle with a hypotenuse of 4 and a base of
2.5.

(We square the hypotenuse (4x4) and get 16. We square the base
(2.5x2.5) and get 6.25. We subtract our answers and get 9.75 and take
the square root and get 3.1224989. That's our height. Now using our
formula for circumference 2x3.1224989x3.14159=19.619 and that is
awfully close to 20.

(Now, let's do the one for the area. The triangle has sides of 3
and a base of 4. Cutting the base in half we have 2. We square the 3
and get 9 and we square the 2 and get 4. We subtract our answer which
is 5 and take the square root. Our answer is 2.236. So the height is
the square root of 5.

(Our formula for finding the area is radius squared times PI.
Since the radius is the square root of 5 when we square the square
root of 5 we get 5, of course. Then multiplying 5 times 3.14159 we
get 15.7 and we were looking for an area which would be 4x4 or 16.
Again pretty close.

(So, if we don't do our math ourselves we can often be lead
astray as we almost were in this case. Now on with his comments.)

"The same proportions, differently expressed, are the basis of
the wonderful Pythagorean problem of the square on the hypothenuse,
which conceals almost the entire Magian system.

"The agreement of 7x9--63, also comes so close to the united
number as to nearly complete a numerical circle, 4x7+4x9=7x9+1=64.
                                                                        289
(Don't know what he means by numerical circle here. 64 is the
square of 8 and the cube of 4. He might mean that a cube is a
numerical circle.)

"On the "Chess-board" system of numeration, 4--12--20--28, we
have 4+12+20 presenting the number 36, as a "square" of 6 (6^)
surrounded by 28 smaller squares.

"Another row of 36, around, gives us a total of ONE HUNDRED, the
"square" of 10 and origin of the decimal system. Further instances
abound in other and widely varying demonstrations.

"It was certainly among the Magi that those interesting
numerical puzzles known as "Magic Squares" had their rise. Ostensibly
the idea was to so align arithmetical numbers, displaying within a
certain number of squares, that added in every sense, they would
produce the same sum.

(Here he is referring to the making of magic squares as I
mentioned earlier which were found in the encyclopedia.)

"The idea of the "Magic Square" was not, however, as might be
supposed, due to human ingenuity, but is attributable entirely to a
natural property of numbers, beginning with the zero (0), rows of
which, in sequence, and aligned so as to constitute horizontal and
perpendicular series, invariably offer an identical addition in every
sense, thus constituting the ILU figure arithmetically as well as
geometrically.

(I have no idea what he means here by an "ILU figure.")

"No more perfect example of this principle could be offered than
the thirty-five squares of our familiar monthly calendar, which
always bring the same figures into perpendicular alignment.

"This calendar designed to exhibit, numerically tabulated with
relation to the month, four weeks of seven days, together with the
three, or four, remaining to complete the mensual period is founded
on a most curious Cabalistic "square", involving the elements of a
table of multiplication, subtraction, division and addition, through
the prime factor 7.

(Here he shows a "calendar" containing a rectangle of 7 across
and 5 down.)

                             0    1     2    3     4    5    6     7
                             7    8     9    10    11   12   13    14
                             14   15    16   17    18   19   20    21

"The number of squares involved is only thirty-five, but a
remarkable metaphysical hint is given in the upper left hand square
                                                                        290
of nine figures, when the month begins on a Monday.

(For a month that begins on a Monday, you can use January,
1996.)

(Here he has an 8 by 5 with the first column shaded. He says this
is "The ancient Septenary Calendar Tablet we still use. The outlined
figures at the left show the manner of its perpetuation by
continually setting to the left the right perpendicular row.")

(Then he presents the nine numbers in the top right hand corner
of the calendar. If you are looking at the January 1996 calendar
there will be a space at the beginning which represents where Dec.
31, 1995 had been. Here he places a zero in that spot.)

                                          0    1     2
                                          7    8     9
                                          14   15    16

"The sums of the cruciform additions are each 24, three of them
1--8--15, 7--8--9, 2--8--14, but the remaining fourth is 8--16,
clearly indicating an unrecorded thirtysixth figure--a zero, the
symbol of the "Non-being-Being", which sustains such an important
role in the theosophy of the ancient world.

"Upon the 35 square the cipher "0" does not exist until the
relation between the 8 and the 16 shows that a symbol for non-
existence must be placed in advance of the figure "1", to complete
the divine symbol.

"The "0" possesses the same significance with reference to the
"X" of 8--0, 7--1, and the cross of 80 of which the 2 is the apex.
Thus the position of the zero "0" is shown clearly to precede "1"
instead of following "9" and to demonstrate metaphysically the
existence of non-existence prior to the development of "1" the
Pythagorean "Monad", or first manifestation of existence.

(The cross of 80 is made by adding the numbers down from 2 to 30
and adding the numbers across from 14 through 18.)

"The square thus symbolizes the "Non-being-Being", the Trinity,
the Circle and Diameter. Beginning and End, 7+0=7, the Lunar number,
8+1=9, the Solar Number. 1--0, "Ten", the Tetrax, also symbolized by
1--2--3--4, 1--7=28 (Lunar), 1--8=36 (Solar) and 7+8+1+0=16, the
"Tetragrammaton".

(Why he says that 16 is the "Tetragrammaton" I don't know. The
"Tetragrammaton" was the four letter name used by the Hebrews for God.
The letters were YHWH, which became Yahweh, which we now pronounce as
Jehovah. Check your encyclopedia.)

"This is the true Cabalistic interpretation of the beginning of
the Divine labor of Creation on the first day of the week, followed
by a cessation of labor and repose upon the recurring period of the

                                                                         291
lunar septenary, which is the inspiration of the whole arrangement.

(Here he uses the word Cabalistic, meaning it comes from the
Cabala, also spelled Kabbala and Quabbala. The Kabbala is mentioned
many times in the Masonic book "Morals and Dogma.")

"The amplification of the diagram to forty compartments, for the
sake of demonstrating the Cabalistic relation of the numbers, one to
another, in no way obscures its identification, as the internal
measure of fleeting time.

"Its base of eight squares and vertical axis of five squares
will at once show it to be another of the mysteries embodied in the
Great Pyramid of Gizeh.

(What he is saying here is that if you use 5 as the radius of a
circle its circumference or perimeter will be equal to the perimeter
of a square which has a side of 8. If the radius of the circle is 5
then the diameter is 10 and 10 times PI is 31.4l59, which is close to
32, the perimeter of a square which has a side of 8. That's close,
but actually the ratio of the Great Pyramid of its height to its base
is not 5 to 8.

(Actually it is 7 to 11. The height of the Great Pyramid is 5813
inches. Using this as the radius of a circle we find that the
circumference is 36524.125. Converting an inch to a day that works
out to 100 years! The side of the base of the pyramid is 9131.0312,
which is one-quarter of 36524.125, its perimeter. Doing some
arithmetic, you will find that those figures can be reduced to 7 for
the height and 11 for the side of the base.

(The Egyptians had no knowledge of PI. PI is somewhere between
21/7 and 22/7. They used 22/7. So if we use the 7 for the radius of
the circle, then its circumference is 44. And we can see that if we
have a side of a base at 11, its perimeter is also 44.

(Somewhere in my books I noted that 44 was more than just a low
on soybeans in 1932. I said it was also a pyramid number. Now you
know!)

(But let's move on to our discussion of the material at hand.)

"A most curious example of the Magic Square, from which is said
to have been derived the Jewish appellation of the eternal Elohim, is
a combined Magic Square and anagram of the Hebrew form of the word
ALHIM, having a numerical expression of 40, 10, 5, 3, 1, or 4, 1, 5,
3, 1.

(The 40, 10, 5, 3, 1, he gets by taking the Hebrew letters for
ALHIM and converting them to a numerical value and then reduces all
to single digits. I discussed reducing all numbers to single digits
in my Book VIII-"The Single Digit Numbering System."

"Arranged in a square of 5x5, it reads as here exhibited:

                                                                        292
                                         3     1     4     1    5
                                         1     4     1     5    3
                                         4     1     5     3    1
                                         1     5     3     1    4

"It will be seen that the play is upon the numbers 3, 4 and 5,
that the word ALHIM reads from the bottom to the top and left to
right as a cross:

                                                     1
                                               1     5     3
                                                     3



"The centre is a Sun-Cross (above) adding 9 in either sense:
in the midst of a 9 square of 28, while the top horizontal and left
perpendicular lines are 3--1--4--1--5 (decimally 3.1415), which is
the mathematical formula of the Pi proportions:

                                         3     1     4     1    5
                                         1     0     0     0    0
                                         4     0     0     0    0
                                         1     0     0     0    0
                                         5     0     0     0    0

(I put in zeroes to fill the other squares for illustration.)

"The central Cross also supplies another circle squaring formula
to the initiate.

(Looking at the central cross we can see that we get 8 if we add
the numbers in the outside squares and that leaves 5 in the center
square. So here again he is probably saying if we used 5 as the
radius of a circle its circumference would be 31.4159 and 8 would be
the side of a square which would have a perimeter of 32. This is the
only thing I can see which he might mean here. Maybe you can see
something else in it.)

"There are several other Magic Squares extant which are of self-
evident Magian origin, but none transcending in vital interest that
which, way back at the dawn of civilization was deemed worthy to
serve as a plan of the Heavens and key to the Firmament.



THE CELESTIAL SQUARE

"That the discovery of the arithmetical qualities of this square
antedated the usage to which it was put there is not the shadow of a

                                                                       293
doubt.

"The latter is altogether arbitrary. Scientists have puzzled
their brains for ages as to why there were just twelve signs of the
Zodiac, precursurs of the twelve gods of Olympus, the twelve tribes
of Israel and the twelve Apostles, but so far as we can inform
ourselves, no wonderment has ever been expressed that there should be
four seasons instead of two, why the Mexicans should have adopted a
Zodiac of twenty animal figures and why the Chinese should have taken
an inner Zodiac of twelve figures and an outer of twenty-eight
constellations (the Astrological "Houses of the Moon"), together with
a cycle of twelve years.

(I don't know what he is referring to by "the latter." Maybe he
has left something out here. But you should note that 12 is a double triangle,
20 is a double triangle and 28 is a triangle.)

"The application is world wide, from Pekin to Peru, westwardly,
but the correspondence with the Magian cosmogonic square of Sixty-
four (4--12--20--28) was too strong to escape attention and the
temptation to seek to discover if it was more than accidental,
pressing.

"Recent experiments with the Magic Squares offered the
suggestion of consecutively numbering the squares of each row
according to their Zodiacal sequence, commencing with the central "4"
and giving the number "1" to the first of the Seasons, the Spring
Equinoctial. Directly beneath this would come Aries, placing Taurus,
the second sign of the western Zodiac in the proper corner.

(When he says "recent experiments" you must remember this was
written or copyrighted in 1912. So when these experiments were made
is anybody's guess.)

"Commencing the following two rows immediately below in turn, in
each case brought the Equinoctial and Solstitial signs into their
proper corners:

                                               E    S
                                               N    W

with the following result:

conviction which hours of experiment only serve to heighten.

Chapter 13--More of the Celes tial Square

We saw that much of what was in our last chapter was not in the
quote in the 1922 book.

But there was more. Much more!

Showing a drawing of the Celestial Square, the magic square,
what we now know to be Gann's Square of Four, he continues, and once
again I will set it down verbatim and come back in the next chapter
to go through it bit by bit:

"The same results which are otherwise obtainable and
demonstrable through geometrical figures are here also presented
through arithmetical numbers, the whole scheme being evidently
intended to exhibit the creative functions of the numbers "3" and
"4", the powers of the Tetrax, (1-2-3-4) and the revelation of the
cross.

"The first figure which obtains our attention is the cross
institued by the fourth and fifth vertical lines with the fourth and
fifth horizontal lines. The sum of each is 136, but so divided that
the fifth vertical column contains 36 and the fourth 100.

"The sums of the fourth and fifth horizontal columns are both
68, totalling 136 but the left arm of the cross adds 36 and the right
arm 100, while the halves of the upright bar each add up 68.

"The central cross is the Solar 36 exhibited as 10+26=36,
18+18=36, alternating in the same manner while the diagonals in the
inner square are 22+14=36; the whole giving the complete ILU figure
of 36, every number or group of four numbers constituting the centre
of a perfect numerical Cross.

"The supreme secret of the entire square of 64 numbers is,
however, revealed by its owns diagonals, which are
11+8+5+2+4+11+18+25=84, and 18+13+8+3+1+2+3+4 equalling 52, a total
of again 136 as added but as multiplied 84x52 equalling 4638, which
will be found also upon computation to be the sum of 364, or one
cycle of 12 Lunar years.

"The addition of the vertical columns supply sums which are
remarkable factors to the ancient calendar year of 360 days
(especially the number 29, the "synodical" period between full
                                                                        295
moons), while the horizontal additions are in precisely reversed
halves, 116-92-76-68-68-76-92-116, a sum total of 704, again a number
of marvellous significance when explained.

"The 'as above, below' additions of dissimilar numbers,
occupying relative places in the upper and lower halves of the square
is also a source of perpetual curiosity.

"Finally, as far as the writer has been able to discover, the
sixteen cardinal point numbers which are the diagonals of the whole
square constitute in themselves a 'Magic Square', no less remarkable,
being as follows:

"The sum total, of course, 52+84=136. The additions are
vertically and horizontally identical, though reversed. 10-26-42-58.

"The sums of the nine sets of four contiguous squares are 26-74-
10-26-34-50-18-18-50, numbers which inter-add, combine and re-combine
in changes upon the grand total of 136 (itself 1 plus 3 plus 6 equals
10) in a manner which can hardly be conceived by anyone who has not
made the experiments.

"The central and outer parallells are always 68, as is also the
sum of the two diagonals.

"It will not pass unnoticed by those acquainted with the formula
of the squaring of the circle for equal perimeters that the base of
the square being equal to 8 and the radius of the circle equal to 5
identical measures that the 84-52 of the figure to which we have been
giving attention, is within a minute fraction of the same proportions
besides espressing the "ILU" figure to perfection.

"This method of procuring numerical crosses being continuable to
infinity gave the ancients' conception of the starry universe, of
which they took it as a type and we have every reason to believe that
this plan (possibly extended to 12x12, or the 144 square) was the
basis of Saint John's mystery of the Heavenly City of the Apocalypse.

"That it was one of the numerous mysteries embodied in the
Pythagorean problem (47th of Euclid) and which must have been the
very centre of the philosophical speculations of the Pythagorean
school at Crotona is self demonstrable.

"The tablet here given is restricted to the proportions of 64,
of 8x8, as within those confines are found the considerations most
important to our present essay.

"As we have said, however, the system of which it is the centre
is extensible to infinity with identical results.

"Every square, except those lying directly on the middle
vertical line below the Zodiac, where highest and lowest figures
meet, whether one, four, nine, sixteen, or other number bounded by
four equal sides, is the centre of a numerical cross.

                                                                        296
"The Pythagorean problem exhibits three such Crosses, which may
be realized by merely omitting the corner squares. They may be
utilized thus, as guides, in counting.

(Here he shows the 47th principle of Euclid with the corners
of the squares of three, four and five cut out.)




                                                                  297
298
"The astonishing fact is also apparent that on all Crosses of
which the central TETRAX (1-2-3-4) is the heart, the halves of the
vertical lines will be found to equal the halves of the horizontal
arm after the following formula:

"A-B, G-H and C-E, D-F are equal amounts, the sums of A-B and G-
H will be unequal, the sums of C-E and D-F will be equal and those of
C-D and E-F unequal, but C-D will equal A-B and G-H will equal E-F,
while A-G and B-H equal C-E and D-F respectively.

"The fomulation of the rule by which this wonderful chart is
governed may be possible to an advanced mathematician, but it seems
to the writer and re-discoverer to, while making apparent many
interesting arithmetical principles, defy exhaustive analysis.

"Many of the "Magic Squares" involved count, not only vertically
and horizontally but diagonally, in the same sums, as wholes, equal
or unequal parts.

"A Magic Square which exhibits the 68-136 potentiality in the
very highest degree exists as the very heart of the Calendar, with the
additional peculiarity, that it exhibits the larger sum as an OCTAGON
as well as the usual ILU form.

"The ground which we have covered, in this necessarily short
resume of a tremendous subject, is, while it covers the essential
features, but an infinitesimal part of the stupendous whole.

"The real study only begins here, when, one by one, we apply the
test of either number or proportion to the whole range of ancient
symbolisms, and discover that they and the philosophies of which they
are the illustrations are all parts and parcels of the one great
cosmic mystery.

dissected in part and which affords countless proofs of its
authenticity in the sense claimed for it, now in our possession.

"Best of all, we find the entire unfolding of the theological
system, which beginning with the forecasts of the Sabaean Magi,
shaped the prophecies of Israel and culminated in the mystery of the
fulfilling life, passion and death of Jesus, the Christ.

"We find therein the key to the tribal heraldic devices of the
ancient world and the beginnings of modern Healdry.

"We learn the secret of the architecture of the temple and the
orientation of the sacred grove.

"All these were derived in secret from the mysteries of Soli-
Lunar geometry and it adds not a little to our wonderment to find in
the revelations of the microscope concerning the structure of various
kinds of matter, that no laws of structural proportions or types of
form are to be dicovered higher than those wonderful figures
worshipped by our ancestors thousands of years ago.

CROSSES AND SWASTIKAS

"The division of the perfect square into sixty-four
quadrilateral divisions, is one which from the wide range of its
applications to ancient symbolism, must have been held in peculiar
reverence, by those who extracted from it so much pertaining to their
most sacred contemplations.

"As we have already hinted, its identity with the legendary
Mosaic pavement of Solomon's Temple, is far from problematical.

"In our easy familiarity with the more common mathematical
processes, connected with our ordinary daily transactions, we seldom
if ever stop to reflect upon the fact, that both the numbers we use
and systems upon which we use them, had to be evolved and perfected,
at some stage of the world's history.

"Judging by the mathematical perfection of most of the monuments
of antiquity, which have remained to our day, the man of B. C. 5,000
was little intellectually inferior to his descendant of our own time.

"Having been enabled to to form an estimate of his reliance upon
geometrical formula, as the basis of all truth, human and devine, let
us see if many of our most familiar emblems, do not owe more than
passing association to such convictions.

"We have no need to enter into a dissertation upon the Game of
                                                                        300
Chess, to prove either the antiquity of that game or of its
companion, Draughts, or "Checkers", for that of both is attested by
history to extend backward to the dawn of civilization.

"We do ask, however, why the number "64", should have been
selected not only as that of the squares of the Chess Board, but to
figure in countless associations with religio-geometrical formula and
we think we answer the question partly in our statement, that as the
sum of 36 and 28, it became sacred to the Sun and the Moon, and
consequently to all religion of Solar-Lunar inception, while its
exact half, 32, has uses and a symbolical significance enirely its
own, of the highest importance.

"The ancients had the same moral convictions as ourselves, in
their case based on pure geometry, that the Supreme Being was made up
of infinite space, infinite time, infinite wisdom, power, strength,
and truth, the latter expressed above all mathmatically and
geometrically.

"The mathematical axiom of truth, is that it must fit all other
truths as untruths could only be made to fit other untruths, which
must be manufactured to fit them.

"Therefore, geometrical symbols of Divinity must prove
themselves, by their entire fidelity, not only the the known facts of
the visisble and calculable universe, but thy their accordance, one
with the other, so that whatever the apparent differences, the
application of the Solar-Lunar mathematical, or geometric test would
attest by the preciseness of its results, the principle of Divinity.

"The most ancient expression of the Supreme Being, is that of
the "square", typifying the universe and divided into four equal
parts by a cross, indicating intrinsically, the outstretching of arms
from a centre to touch the limits of space as does the Sun, and
developing by its relation to its sides a Swastika, typical of the
eternal revolution of time, a circular movement, corresponding with
the disc of the Sun.

"To entirely surround the four square, thus constituted with
squares of exactly equal size, requires, as we have seen, just twelve
and these are the squares to which were apportioned , the signs of
the Zodiac, the entire sixteen constituting the famous
"Tetragrammaton" of the Jewish "Kabbalah".

"We have noted that the total of these squares is one fourth of
64 and one twenty-fourth part of 384.

"Another boundary of squares, on the outside of this requires 20
to establish, which is an eighteenth of 360 and added to the 16
within makes 36, the 10th of the same number.

"Another row all around, adds 28 squares, a thirteenth of 364,
bringing the sum of all to 64.

"The larger figure will be at once recognized as the basis of
                                                                        301
most of the ancient calendars.

"It is not patent to our present argument, but important as
showing the natural origin of the decimal system, that a single
additional row of squares requires exactly 36 and that the total
thereof is one hundred.

"This number will then be made up of four equal divions of 25
squares, each of which, taken in the same sense, will be found to be
built up around one central square, on a scale of 1+8+16=25. We have
reviewed the sacred signifiance of these squares, as expressed in
numbers.

"It seems almost impossible to convert these 100, or 64 squares
into anything but Calendrical figures, by the subtraction of small
squares from the corners, so as to produce Latin Crosses, or by
symmetrical diagonal intersection, the form of the so-called Maltese
and other Crosses, which occasion so much surprise in those, who,
supposing them to belong exclusively to modern Heraldry, find them as
amulets, on the necks and wrists of Babylonian, Ninevite and Persian
Monarchs of the earliest dynasties.

"There is no doubt, but that the original Cross and Swastika,
were the lines indicating divisions, but by extension they came to
have compartments of their own and we find them blocked out on the
square of of 64, or in more numerous divisions as perfect geometrical
symbols of the Chronological cult of the times which produced them.

"The whole family of Crosses and Swastikas, as well as of
certain pointed crosses, which partake of both the nature of crosses
and stars, belong in their entirety to the nature of Solar amulets,
blocked out upon such squares.

"All speculation as to the reason for the selection of given
numbers for the division of time is entirely silenced by this
remarkable testimony, which embraces the most sacred symbolism of the
ancient world and connects it with our own age, by an association at
once touching and reassuring of unswerving purpose in the eternal
intention.

From here the writer goes on to tell about crosses and swastikas
being found in many parts of the world. Then I pick up his narrative
again:

"There is no important excavation of an ancient site made, which
does not reveal it and the time does not seem far distant when we
shall be able to constitute a map of its geographical area, which
will be greater that that of civilization.

"When shall we be able to determine the time when our
ancsestors, Iranian, or Turanian, first evolved it!

"It seems beyond the possibility of doubt that the "Swastika",
to preserve its Indian name, was above all and before all a symbol in
the mysterious or mystic sense...
                                                                        302
(Then he lists some more places where swastikas are found and we
pick up his narrative again)

"The use of the Swastika in place of the Sun on coins and other
objects has long been recognized by scholars, the only alternative
thought of any value suggested, that given the employment by the
Chinese of a square containing a Cross to indicate an enclosed space
of earth, it might have meant by extension the terrestial world.

"This latter notion has more behind it than casually meets the
eye.

"The Swastika is certainly a symbol of the revolution of some
body or system.

"It too often alternates with wheel and cross amid the same
attendant symbols for this not to be apparent, but its specialized
form gives it the right to consideration upon its own individual
merits.

"Our demonstration of its development, first from the linear
elements of the crosssed square and then as a geometrical figure of
deninite contents, as an unmistakable figure of the revolution of the
whole Solar system, would lead us to regard it as a symbol of
planetary revolution in general, applicable to any revolving body of
the universal cosmogany, but of rourse more especially to the Sun.

"The whole problem hangs upon the amount of assumption which we
are warranted in entertaining that all of the ancients were at all
times densely ignorant of the present known facts of the procession
of the universe.

"This is a question, which has been much under discusssion
without being brought to any such satisfactory conclusion that
Science has felt warranted in pronouncing dogmatically upon it.

"We however have the authority of many of the ancient writers
not only for the globular form of the earth, but for the existence of
conditions in far distant regions which are the direct result of this
form of the earth couple with its relations to Sun and Moon as at
present ascertained and also of the ancient knowledge of lands
vulgarly held to be discovered at a much later period of the world's
history.

"The earliest known teacher of the globular form of the Earth
was Pythagoras Eudoxus of Cnidus who lived in circa 370-60 B. C. at
which time he offered the mathematical proofs of his assertion and
was the instigator of the division of both celestial and terrestrial
plans into zones.

"A huge globe, so divided, was constructed at Pergamum, by one
Crates of Mallos (160-50 B. C. and the representation of a celestial
sphere in the hands of Urania, goddess of Mathematics, was ohly one of
its significal applications in early times.
                                                                         303
"The subject of the Swastika brings us to the consideration of
one of the most remarkable of all Dr. Schliemann's discoveries at
Hissarlik on the site of ancient Troy, that of terra-cotta spheres or
small globes upon some of which are clearly indicated the Sun and
Moon with many stars and others of which are marked with encircling
zones or bands, exactly in number and position indicating the Artic,
north temperate, equatorial, south temperate and antartic regions,
the path of the sun around the equator being marked with a circle of
Swastikas, and a single sign like a capital "N" laid on its side.

"There was a bitter controversy between Professor Schliemann and
his critic, Dr. E. Brentano of Frankfor-on-the-Main , upon the
subject of these clay balls, the latter vehemently contending that
they so conclusively proved that the people who produced them were so
well acquainted with the globular form of the earth that the locality
claimed to be Homer's Troy by, Dr. Schliemann, must be comparatively
modern.

"Mr. Edward Thomas, of London, who shares with Father Louis
Gaillard, S. J., the reputation of special competence concerning
Swastika signs, has said in his "Indian Swastika and Its Western
Counterparts", 'As far as I have been able to trace or connect the
various manifestations of this emblem, they one and all resolve
themselves into the primitive conception of solar motion which was
intuitively associated with the rolling or wheel like projection of
the Sun, through the upper or visible arc of the heavens, as
understood and accepted in the crude astronomy of the ancients.

"The earliest phase of astronomical science we are at persent
(1880) in a position to refer to, with the still extant aid of
indigenous diagrams, is the Chaldean.

"The representation of the Sun, in this system commences with a
simple ring or outline circle, which is speedily advanced towards the
impresssion of onward revolving motion by the insertion of a cross or
four wheel like spokes within the circumference of the normal ring.

(Here again I will leave out some of his comments on where
swastikas and crosses can be found and then pick up his words again)

"The writer possesses, himself, coins of the Veliocasses, a
Gaulish tribe which settled before the dawn of North European
history, in the valley of the Seine, just above the Parisii, which
unites the five pointed geometrical pentalpha to an "ILU" Solar
symbol, flanked by bird and reptile, precisely as we find this
combination on the national emblems of Chinese and Japanese today.

What the Swastika Really Is

"It is astonishing how near humanity has come, again and again,
to the real secret of the Swastika, without crossing the line which
exits between conjecture and certainty.

"The Swastika is all that it has been deemed to be and something
                                                                        304
more.

"Its symbolic associations with solar motion have been too
remarkable not to have placed it in the category of solar symbols,
but it has remained for us to indicate its true character and a fresh
array of considerations which show it to be far more wonderul than
anything so far surmised.

"No one can fail to recognize its numerical value as a
calendrical symbol suggestive of the revolution of periods of time in
the blocking out on our system of numericl squares of a figure of
four season, twelve months and fifty-two weeks.

"We have entered, in our observations concerning the "Forty-
seventh problem of Euclid" and its far reaching bearings upon the
various geometrical formulae having to do with the Squaring of the
Circle and also determined the reasons which led the ancients to
divide the cube of "Four" (64) into a Solar 36 and a Lunar 28.

"Having ascertained the relative proportions of our Circle of
equal area to our Square of "Sixty-four", blocking the latter out
into a Swastika expressing a year of Fifty-two weeks and supposing it
to be endowed with rotary motion, we see that as it turns, the inner
angles of of the arms precisely trace the Circle, so that the
Swastika becomes a most realistic image of the great Cabalistic
secret, the Squaring of the Circle by the heavenly bodies in their
annual revolution.

"The Asiatic form of Swastika, which is double jointed, proves
to be so constructed that while the inner angle is inscribing the
Circle of equal area, one of the outer ones is tracing that of equal
perimeter or within a small fraction of it.

"A very little reflection will show that while the fundamental
idea of the Swastika begins with the broken "Ilu" square, that it may
be seen in the "Male principle" "Nine" of the Euclid problem, where
even at that low stage of development it serves to connect the Sun
with the creative power.

"The space between the two circles, much used by the devotees of
Eastern religions and philosophical cults to express the realm of
"Chaos" existent between Heaven and the Universe, became in the West
the Zodiacal Circle, receiving the figures from the corresponding
divisions of the earlier Zodiacal Square.

"This arrangement at once confers upon the
Swastika the charcter of a symbol of the Four Seaons, a device
which causes the second Zodiacal sign, Tarus to fall to a corner
place.

"Now we well know from the general position that this lower left
hand corner must correspond with the early part of the year, so if we
are to determine the arms of the Swastika, as the Equnoctial and
Sostitial points, we will see that a still deeper significance is
intended; nothing more nor less that that great cyclical revolution of
                                                                         305
the whole Universe, which, at intervals of thousands of years apart,
carries the beignnings of the Equinoxes and Solstices, slowly from a
position of the Sun in one sign of the Zodiac to one in another.

"Universal chronology and the length of time which separates us
from the beginning of the world, was reckoned on the assumption that
when God created the Universe, He started the great pendulum of Time
swinging, with the Sun in the sign Aires.

"Hence the great esoteric connection of Ram and Lamb with
various religions.

"In the course of several milleniusm, the Spring Equnoticial
arm of the great cosmogonic Swastika had swung around to the sign of
Taurus, the Bull, and this is the main evidence that the great
geometrical revelation took place at some time during the "Tauric"
period, when Circle squareing, the Zodiac and the Swastika, all
coincided as we see them in the following figure.

"The Hon. E. M. Plunkett (Ancient Calendars and Constellations)
says with regard to this sjubect--"The beginning of the Median year
was fixed in the season of the Spring Equninox, and remaining true to
that season, followed no star mark.

"'The great importance, however, of Tauric symbolism in Medean
art, seems to point to the fact, that when the equinotial year
was first established THE SPRING EQUINOTCIAL POINT WAS IN THE
CONSTELLATION TAURUS.

"'astronomy teaches us , that was the case, speaking in round
numbers, from 2000 to 4000 BC.'

"The Swastika "of the double Circle" is even more precise in its
Solar-Lunar numberation than the simpler form, for laid out on a
square of 16x16 or 256, it divides that volume into four arms of 28
each, without counting the centre 4, which added to the spaces
between the arms gives us four sections of 36 each."

And thus ends the book.




Chapter 14--Some More Explanations

Now let's go back over what we saw in Chapter 13 and see what we
can learn.

"The same results which are otherwise obtainable and
demonstrable through geometrical figures are here also presented
through arithmetical numbers, the whole scheme being evidently
intended to exhibit the creative functions of the numbers "3" and
"4", the powers of the Tetrax, (1-2-3-4) and the revelation of the
cross.

                                                                        306
"The first figure which obtains our attention is the cross
instituted by the fourth and fifth vertical lines with the fourth and
fifth horizontal lines. The sum of each is 136, but so divided that
the fifth vertical column contains 36 and the fourth 100.

"The sums of the fourth and fifth horizontal columns are both
68, totalling 136 but the left arm of the cross adds 36 and the right
arm 100, while the halves of the upright bar each add up to 68. (We
can see this in the chart below)

"The central cross is the Solar 36 exhibited as 10+26=36,
18+18=36, alternating in the same manner...(see chart below)

... while the diagonals in the inner square are 22+14=36; (see
chart below)

                                        5     x    x     8

the whole giving the complete ILU figure of 36, every number or
group of four numbers constituting the centre of a perfect numerical
Cross.

"The supreme secret of the entire square of 64 numbers is,
however, revealed by its owns diagonals, which are
11+8+5+2+4+11+18+25=84, and 18+13+8+3+1+2+3+4 equalling 52, a total
of again 136 as added but as multiplied 84x52 equalling 4638, which
will be found also upon computation to be the sum of 364x12, or one
cycle of twelve Lunar years. (see chart below)

"The addition of the vertical columns supply sums which are
remarkable factors to the ancient calendar year of 360 days
(especially the number 29, the "synodical" period between full
moons), while the horizontal additions are in precisely reversed
halves, 116-92-76-68-68-76-92-116, a sum total of 704, again a number
of marvellous significance when explained.
(He doesn't explain the significance of 704. I have played around with the
number and the only thing I can come up with and it might be the answer
is the fact that it is 8 times 88. Eighty-eight days is the heliocycle of
Mercury. 704 is also 21 times 64 or the triangle of 6 times the square
of 8. This has the same relationship as the triangle of 4 (10) times the
square of 6 (36) which equals 360.)

"The 'as above, below' additions of dissimilar numbers,
occupying relative places in the upper and lower halves of the square
is also a source of perpetual curiosity.

"Finally, as far as the writer has been able to discover, the
sixteen cardinal point numbers which are the diagonals of the whole
square constitute in themselves a 'Magic Square', no less remarkable,
being as follows:

                                            N       E         W         S

"The sum total, of course, 52+84=136. The additions are
vertically and horizontally identical, though reversed. 10-26-42-58.

"The sums of the nine sets of four contiguous squares are 26-74-
10-26-34-50-18-18-50, numbers which inter-add, combine and re-combine
in changes upon the grand total of 136 (itself 1 plus 3 plus 6 equals
10) in a manner which can hardly be conceived by anyone who has not
made the experiments.

"The central and outer parallels are always 68, as is also the
sum of the two diagonals.

"This method of procuring numerical crosses being continuable to
infinity gave the ancients' conception of the starry universe, of
which they took it as a type and we have every reason to believe that
this plan (possibly extended to 12x12, or the 144 square) was the
basis of Saint John's mystery of the Heavenly City of the Apocalypse.

"That it was one of the numerous mysteries embodied in the
Pythagorean problem (47th of Euclid) and which must have been the
very centre of the philosophical speculations of the Pythagorean
school at Crotona is self demonstrable.

"The tablet here given is restricted to the proportions of 64,
of 8x8, as within those confines are found the considerations most
important to our present essay.

"As we have said, however, the system of which it is the centre
is extensible to infinity with identical results.

"Every square, except those lying directly on the middle
vertical line below the Zodiac, where highest and lowest figures
                                                                        309
meet, whether one, four, nine, sixteen, or other number bounded by
four equal sides, is the centre of a numerical cross.

"The Pythagorean problem exhibits three such Crosses, which may
be realized by merely omitting the corner squares. They may be
utilized thus, as guides, in counting.


"The astonishing fact is also apparent that on all Crosses of
which the central TETRAX (1-2-3-4) is the heart, the halves of the
vertical lines will be found to equal the halves of the horizontal
arm after the following formula:

"A-B, G-H and C-E, D-F are equal amounts, the sums of A-B and G-
H will be unequal, the sums of C-E and D-F will be equal and those of
C-D and E-F unequal, but C-D will equal A-B and G-H will equal E-F,
while A-G and B-H equal C-E and D-F respectively.

"The formulation of the rule by which this wonderful chart is
governed may be possible to an advanced mathematician, but it seems
to the writer and re-discoverer to, while making apparent many
interesting arithmetical principles, defy exhaustive analysis.

"Many of the "Magic Squares" involved count, not only vertically
and horizontally but diagonally, in the same sums, as wholes, equal
or unequal parts.

"A Magic Square which exhibits the 68-136 potentiality in the
very highest degree exists at the very heart of the Calendar, with
the additional peculiarity, that it exhibits the larger sum as an
OCTAGON as well as the usual ILU form.


"The ground which we have covered, in this necessarily short
resume of a tremendous subject, is, while it covers the essential
features, but an infinitesimal part of the stupendous whole.

symbolisms, and discover that they and the philosophies of which they
are the illustrations are all parts and parcels of the one great
cosmic mystery.


(Before we move on let's study that chart that shows the numbers
on the diagonals, the one this author had marked as north, south.
east and west. We will move on to the author's material later.

I want to stop here as there is a PATTERN in this material that
the author never mentions, but was probably much aware of as Gann
never mentions a lot of things in his material though he was aware of
it.

I found the PATTERN here by playing with the numbers since I had
a suspicion as to what they would show.

Let's look at the numbers again:

                                       4     11       18   25
                                       3     8        13   18
                                       2     5        8    11
                                       1     2        3    4

We now know that the numbers in the chart above when added equal
136.

Does that ring any bells with you?

We can see that the chart is a 4x4 and 4x4 is 16.

Ring any bells now?

136 is the triangle of 16!

Does that suggest anything to you?

Let's start at 1 and build some squares from 1 to 4 to see if we
can discover a PATTERN, a PATTERN that the author did not show me,
but a PATTERN I found myself since I had a suspicion it was there!

First we put down the square of 1

                                                  1

That didn't show us a lot but remember we usually have to start
with 1 and as I have shown before, the number 1 can be lots of
things. it can be a square, a triangle, a cube, etc.

Now lets take the material from the author's drawing and make a
2x2.

                                             2        5

                                                                        311
                                                  1        2

We see that the numbers add to 10.

Does that tell you anything?

If not let's build the next square, a 3x3, using the author's
material again.

                                              3        8        13
                                              2        5        8
                                              1        2        3

If we add all the numbers we get a total of 45. Is the light
dawning now?

Okay, let's go ahead and put down the original.

                                          4       11       18        25

If you don't have the answer yet, why not back off for awhile
and run it through your mind before seeing the answer below.

Got it now?

Let's put down each of the four squares and what they total.

1x1=1 and has a total of 1
2x2=4 and has a total of 10
3x3=9 and has a total of 45
4x4=16 and has a total of 136.

From what I told you above about 16 and 136, do you get it now?

That's right! Each of those totals is a triangular number.

And 1 is the triangle of 1, 10 is the triangle of 4, 45 is the
triangle of 9 and 136 is the triangle of 16.

So what can we say about those triangular numbers? They are all
triangles of squares!

If we continued to make these squares in the manner that the
first four squares were made, could you guess what the total would
be.

The next square after the 4x4 would be a 5x5. If we continued
with the PATTERN what would be the total of that square? If you said
325 you would be right. 5x5 is 25 and the triangle of 25 is 25x26/2
which is 325.
                                                                          312
But you may ask what are the numbers that are needed in the
square so that the total comes out to 325?

Let's look at the 4x4 again.
                                             4        11        18        25
                                             3        8         13        18
                                             2        5         8         11
                                             1        2         3         4


Do you see the PATTERN?

In the first column. we see 1, 2, 3, 4. In the second we see 2,
5, 8, 11. In the third column we see 3, 8, 13, 18 and in the fourth
we see 4, 11, 18, 25.

Do you see it now?

Note that in the first column the difference in numbers is 1, in
the second, it is 3, in the third it is 5 and in the fourth it is 7.

1, 3, 5, 7! Those are the odd numbers in order. From our work in
"On the Square" we also know that the odd numbers add up to squares.

So, why don't you get a piece of paper and write down the
numbers that make up the 4x4 and then extend that to a 5x5 and fill
in the numbers.

Since the difference in the numbers in the last column in the
4x4 was 7, the difference in the numbers in the column going up from
5 would be 9. So you would put down 5, 14, 23, 32 and 41.

You have probably seen from the other squares that the numbers
going up the columns or going across the rows are the same. So
starting at 5 in the upper left you would fill in 14, 23 and 32.

                                         5       14        23        32        41
                                         4       11        18        25        32
                                         3       8         13        18        23
                                         2       5         8         11        14
                                         1       2         3         4         5

Now why don't you go ahead and extend our work until we have a
square of 6.

                                     6       17       28        39        50    61
                                     5       14       23        32        41    50
                                     4       11       18        25        32    39
                                     3       8        13        18        23    28
                                     2       5        8         11        14    17

                                                                                     313
                                       1         2         3         4         5         6

And then we will extend that until we have a square of 7.

                                  7         20        33        46        59        72        85

                                  4         11        18        25        32        39        46
                                  3         8         13        18        23        28        33

In every one of these cases the total is the triangle of the
square in question. It works every time!

Look at the square of 12 below. You will see that I have numbers
out at the right side of the square. I did that to double check on
the totals.

As I did that I also discovered another PATTERN.

You want to give it a try before I proceed to see if you can
discover the PATTERN for yourself?

I'll take a brief rest while you do that.

Back already?

Total = 10440 = Triangle of Square of 12 (144)

Okay. Let's look at your work. On the last row we see that the
total is 78. And since we got that total by adding 1 through 12 we
know that 78 is the triangle of 12. Then you subtracted 78 from the
next row and found that the difference was 144. Then you subtracted
the second row from the third and found the difference was 144. And
you did that again and again finding that the difference in all cases
was 144. And we know that 144 is the square of 12 and the square of
12 is the square in question.

Does that give you any ideas about PATTERNS?

Well, let's check another one, say the square of 5.

                              5     14    23       32     41         =   115
                              4     11    18       25     32         =   90
                              3     8     13       18     23         =   65
                              2     5     8        11     14         =   40
                              1     2     3        4      5          =   15

Total = 325 = Triangle of Square of 5 (25)

We see that the bottom row totals 15. And we know that is the
triangle of 5. When we subtract the bottom row from the next we find
that the difference is 25. And we find the difference is 25 between
all the other rows.

Got it now?

That's right. We can take any number and find its triangle and
its square and starting with the triangle we can add the squares to
it until we have the triangle of the square. How many terms would we
need? The terms would be the square root of the square in question.

With the square of 5 we would need 5 terms.

We would put down the triangle of 5 which is 15 and would keep
adding the square of 5 or 25 to that until we have five terms.

15+25+25+25+25 or
15
                                                                                                  316
40
65
90
115
so that each succeeding number is 25 more than the one before it
beginning with 15.

Then when we have all five terms down we add up our answers and
get 325 and we have already learned that 325 is the triangle of 25
(the square of 5).

We can do it with a smaller number. We know that the triangle of
4 (which is the square of 2) is 10 and therefore 10 is the triangle
of a square.

Since 2 is the square root of 4 we only need two terms.

The triangle of two is 3. So we put that down:
3

and the square of 2 is 4 so we add 4 to 3 and get 7.

3
4
----
7

Then we take our 3 which is the triangle of 2 and we always
start from the triangle of our square root and our 7 which we got by
adding the square to it and we have our two terms, 3 and 7 and three
plus 7 is 10, the triangle of the square of 2.

Try a few yourself and see that it works every time!

Why should we be interested in the triangle of the squares? For
one thing it is the PATTERN that we found while looking at this
author's chart.

For another it is because of a number that Gann zeroed in on.

In my discussion of the triangular numbers in Book VI, I noted
that Gann had mentioned the number 325 and said there was a change in
cycles here and it was where two 45-degree angles crossed. It is one
of the few numbers that Gann has anything specific to say about.

I never could figure out what he meant by two 45-degree angles
crossing here, but I did point out that it was a triangular number.

But now we know it is more than that. It is not just a triangle
of a number, but is a triangle of a square, the square of 25.

And now we see from the Magic Square that the triangles of the
squares is made from the Magic Square. Do I know how Gann used these
numbers? No I don't. But it is a very interesting PATTERN which needs
more study.
                                                                        317
Now we will pick up the author's material again in the next chapter.



Chapter 15--The Swas tika

(Before I go on with the author's material I must say something
here lest anyone be offended.

I know that the swastika was the dreaded symbol of Nazi Germany.
But the swastika was around thousands of years before the advent of
Adolph Hitler.

If you look in an encyclopedia you will find that it was an
ancient cross. And in some places I have read that it was the symbol
of the sun.

The material that we are looking at here was written in 1912,
about 18 years before Hitler came to power and adopted it for his
Nazi party.

So with that in mind let us look at it through the eyes of this
author that we are studying and not think about it in terms of its
present day hated symbol.)

"Swastikas, Triquestras, Crosses, Suns, Stars and Crescents,
Ankhs, Taus, the "palmettes", lotuses and ornamental traceries of
Palace and Temple, The gods of Olympus, the Pyramids of the old world
and the new, the "Calendar-Stones" of the Aztecs, the "Prayer-sticks"
of the Incas, the Totems of the frozen north, the Labarynth through
which roamed the Cretan Minotaur, the winged Bulls of Sargon and
Sennecherib, the hidden wisdom of the Mede, Persian, Assyrian,
Babylonian, Chaldean, Israelite, Hindoo, Gaul, Viking, Mongol and
painted savage are all bound up in the system which we have just
dissected in part and which affords countless proofs of its
authenticity in the sense claimed for it, now in our possession.

"Best of all, we find the entire unfolding of the theological
system, which beginning with the forecasts of the Sabaean Magi,
shaped the prophecies of Israel and culminated in the mystery of the
fulfilling life, passion and death of Jesus, the Christ.

"We find therein the key to the tribal heraldic devices of the
ancient world and the beginnings of modern Hearaldry.

"We learn the secret of the architecture of the temple and the
orientation of the sacred grove.

"All these were derived in secret from the mysteries of Soli-
Lunar geometry and it adds not a little to our wonderment to find in
the revelations of the microscope concerning the structure of various
kinds of matter, that no laws of structural proportions or types of
form are to be discovered higher than those wonderful figures
worshipped by our ancestors thousands of years ago.
                                                                        318
CROSSES AND SWASTIKAS

"The division of the perfect square into sixty-four
quadrilateral divisions, is one which from the wide range of its
applications to ancient symbolism, must have been held in peculiar
reverence, by those who extracted from it so much pertaining to their
most sacred contemplations.

"As we have already hinted, its identity with the legendary
Mosaic pavement of Solomon's Temple, is far from problematical.
(I have read this in the bible and do not see how this is
connected with the Mosaic pavement)

"In our easy familiarity with the more common mathematical
processes, connected with our ordinary daily transactions, we seldom
if ever stop to reflect upon the fact, that both the numbers we use
and systems upon which we use them, had to be evolved and perfected,
at some stage of the world's history.

"Judging by the mathematical perfection of most of the monuments
of antiquity, which have remained to our day, the man of B. C. 5,000
was little intellectually inferior to his descendant of our own time.

"Having been enabled to form an estimate of his reliance upon
geometrical formula, as the basis of all truth, human and devine, let
us see if many of our most familiar emblems, do not owe more than
passing association to such convictions.

"We have no need to enter into a dissertation upon the Game of
Chess, to prove either the antiquity of that game or of its
companion, Draughts, or "Checkers", for that of both is attested by
history to extend backward to the dawn of civilization.

(Here he is referring to the fact that both chess and checkers
is played on a board with 64 squares.)

"We do ask, however, why the number "64", should have been
selected not only as that of the squares of the Chess Board, but to
figure in countless associations with religio-geometrical formula and
we think we answer the question partly in our statement, that as the
sum of 36 and 28, it became sacred to the Sun and the Moon, and
consequently to all religion of Solar-Lunar inception, while its
exact half, 32, has uses and a symbolical significance entirely its
own, of the highest importance.

(The only thing I can think of which is related to the number 32
is the fact that it is a double square, being two times 16 (4x4). It
is also mentioned in Masonry that when added to 40 it equals 72. And
much is made of that number in Masonry.)

"The ancients had the same moral convictions as ourselves, in
their case based on pure geometry, that the Supreme Being was made up
of infinite space, infinite time, infinite wisdom, power, strength,
and truth, the latter expressed above all mathematically and
                                                                        319
geometrically.

"The mathematical axiom of truth, is that it must fit all other
truths as untruths could only be made to fit other untruths, which
must be manufactured to fit them.

"Therefore, geometrical symbols of Divinity must prove
themselves, by their entire fidelity, not only to the known facts of
the visible and calculable universe, but by their accordance, one
with the other, so that whatever the apparent differences, the
application of the Solar-Lunar mathematical, or geometric test would
attest by the preciseness of its results, the principle of Divinity.

"The most ancient expression of the Supreme Being, is that of
the "square", typifying the universe and divided into four equal
parts by a cross, indicating intrinsically, the outstretching of arms
from a centre to touch the limits of space as does the Sun, and
developing by its relation to its sides a Swastika, typical of the
eternal revolution of time, a circular movement, corresponding with
the disc of the Sun.

"To entirely surround the four square, thus constituted with
squares of exactly equal size, requires, as we have seen, just twelve
and these are the squares to which were apportioned, the signs of the
Zodiac, the entire sixteen constituting the famous "Tetragrammaton"
of the Jewish "Kabbalah".

(I'm not sure what he is saying here about the entire sixteen
constituting the famous "Tetragrammaton" as the Tetragrammaton is
described in the encyclopedia as the "four" letters used by the
Hebrews to express the name of God. Those four letters were YHWH
which we call Yahweh or Jehovah. So I'm not sure how he gets 16 out
of 4 other than the fact that 16 is the square of four.)

"We have noted that the total of these squares is one fourth of
64 and one twenty-fourth part of 384.

(He does not say what 384 represents, but in my reading I ran
across the fact that 384 in some cultures represented cycles of
Venus. Venus has 8 year cycles, that is it takes 8 years for Venus to
come back to the same place in the sky. The ancients had rocks or
mountains and used a certain point on the mountain to mark the return
of Venus to a certain point just over that mountain every 8 years.
The number 384 marks 48 cycles of 8 years. Why they marked 48 cycles
of 8 years I do not know. See my Book V--"The Cycle of Venus." Also
see in my Appendix my work about the Mayan calendar and the possibility
there for the number 384 and how it relates to the number 360.)


"Another boundary of squares, on the outside of this requires 20
to establish, which is an eighteenth of 360 and added to the 16
within makes 36, the 10th of the same number.

"Another row all around, adds 28 squares, a thirteenth of 364,
bringing the sum of all to 64.
                                                                          320
"The larger figure will be at once recognized as the basis of
most of the ancient calendars.

"It is not patent to our present argument, but important as
showing the natural origin of the decimal system, that a single
additional row of squares requires exactly 36 and that the total
thereof is one hundred.

"This number will then be made up of four equal divisions of 25
squares, each of which, taken in the same sense, will be found to be
built up around one central square, on a scale of 1+8+16=25. We have
reviewed the sacred significance of these squares, as expressed in
numbers.

(And here we can see that he is describing 4 divisions which
equal 25 and can be made like the Square of Nine or Cycle of Eight or
Octagon chart.)

"It seems almost impossible to convert these 100, or 64 squares
into anything but Calendrical figures, by the subtraction of small
squares from the corners, so as to produce Latin Crosses, or by
symetrical diagonal intersection, the form of the so-called Maltese
and other Crosses, which occasion so much surprise in those, who,
supposing them to belong exclusively to modern Heraldry, find them as
amulets, on the necks and wrists of Babylonian, Ninevite and Persian
Monarchs of the earliest dynasties.

"There is no doubt, but that the original Cross and Swastika,
were the lines indicating divisions, but by extension they came to
have compartments of their own and we find them blocked out on the
square of 64, or in more numerous divisions as perfect geometrical
symbols of the Chronological cult of the times which produced them.

"The whole family of Crosses and Swastikas, as well as of
certain pointed crosses, which partake of both the nature of crosses
and stars, belong in their entirety to the nature of Solar amulets,
blocked out upon such squares.

"All speculation as to the reason for the selection of given
numbers for the division of time is entirely silenced by this
remarkable testimony, which embraces the most sacred symbolism of the
                                                                               321
ancient world and connects it with our own age, by an association at
once touching and reassuring of unswerving purpose in the eternal
intention.

(From here the writer goes on to tell about crosses and
swastikas being found in many parts of the world. Then I pick up his
narrative again:)

"There is no important excavation of an ancient site made, which
does not reveal it and the time does not seem far distant when we
shall be able to constitute a map of its geographical area, which
will be greater than that of civilization.

"When shall we be able to determine the time when our ancestors,
Iranian, or Turanian, first evolved it!

"It seems beyond the possibility of doubt that the 'Swastika',
to preserve its Indian name, was above all and before all a symbol in
the mysterious or mystic sense...

(Then he lists some more places where swastikas are found and we
pick up his narrative again:)

"The use of the Swastika in place of the Sun on coins and other
objects has long been recognized by scholars, the only alternative
thought of any value suggested, that given the employment by the
Chinese of a square containing a Cross to indicate an enclosed space
of earth, it might have meant by extension the terrestial world.

"This latter notion has more behind it than casually meets the
eye.

"The Swastika is certainly a symbol of the revolution of some
body or system.

"It too often alternates with wheel and cross amid the same
attendant symbols for this not to be apparent, but its specialized
form gives it the right to consideration upon its own individual
merits.

"Our demonstration of its development, first from the linear
elements of the crossed square and then as a geometrical figure of
definite contents, as an unmistakable figure of the revolution of the
whole Solar system, would lead us to regard it as a symbol of
planetary revolution in general, applicable to any revolving body of
the universal cosmogany, but of rourse more especially to the Sun.

(In that last line he says "rourse" but I would conclude that is
a misspelling for "course.")

"The whole problem hangs upon the amount of assumption which we
are warranted in entertaining that all of the ancients were at all
times densely ignorant of the present known facts of the procession
of the universe.

                                                                        322
"This is a question, which has been much under discussion
without being brought to any such satisfactory conclusion that
Science has felt warranted in pronouncing dogmatically upon it.

"We however have the authority of many of the ancient writers
not only for the globular form of the earth, but for the existence of
conditions in far distant regions which are the direct result of this
form of the earth couple with its relations to Sun and Moon as at
present ascertained and also of the ancient knowledge of lands
vulgarly held to be discovered at a much later period of the world's
history.

"The earliest known teacher of the globular form of the Earth
was Pythagoras Eudoxus of Cnidus who lived in circa 370-60 B. C. at
which time he offered the mathematical proofs of his assertion and
was the instigator of the division of both celestial and terrestrial
plans into zones.

"A huge globe, so divided, was constructed at Pergamum, by one
Crates of Mallos (160-50 B. C.) and the representation of a celestial
sphere in the hands of Urania, goddess of Mathematics, was only one
of its significal applications in early times.

"The subject of the Swastika brings us to the consideration of
one of the most remarkable of all Dr. Schliemann's discoveries at
Hissarlik on the site of ancient Troy, that of terra-cotta spheres or
small globes upon some of which are clearly indicated the Sun and
Moon with many stars and others of which are marked with encircling
zones or bands, exactly in number and position indicating the Artic,
north temperate, equatorial, south temperate and antartic regions,
the path of the sun around the equator being marked with a circle of
Swastikas, and a single sign like a capital "N" laid on its side.

(If I am not mistaken this Dr. Schliemann's work on looking for
the site of ancient Troy was recently profiled in a TV program on the
Discovery Channel or the A&E Channel. At least it was someone looking
for ancient Troy and it might have been him.)

"There was a bitter controversy between Professor Schliemann and
his critic, Dr. E. Brentano of Frankfort-on-the-Main, upon the
subject of these clay balls, the latter vehemently contending that
they so conclusively proved that the people who produced them were so
well acquainted with the globular form of the earth that the locality
claimed to be Homer's Troy, by Dr. Schliemann, must be comparatively
modern.

"Mr. Edward Thomas, of London, who shares with Father Louis
Gaillard, S. J., the reputation of special competence concerning
Swastika signs, has said in his "Indian Swastika and Its Western
Counterparts", 'As far as I have been able to trace or connect the
various manifestations of this emblem, they one and all resolve
themselves into the primitive conception of solar motion which was
intuitively associated with the rolling or wheel like projection of
the Sun, through the upper or visible arc of the heavens, as
understood and accepted in the crude astronomy of the ancients.
                                                                        323
"The earliest phase of astronomical science we are at present
(1880) in a position to refer to, with the still extant aid of
indigenous diagrams, is the Chaldean.

"The representation of the Sun, in this system commences with a
simple ring or outline circle, which is speedily advanced towards the
impression of onward revolving motion by the insertion of a cross or
four wheel like spokes within the circumference of the normal ring.
(Here again I will leave out some of his comments on where
swastikas and crosses can be found and then pick up his words again:)

"The writer possesses, himself, coins of the Veliocasses, a
Gaulish tribe which settled before the dawn of North European
history, in the valley of the Seine, just above the Parisii, which
unites the five pointed geometrical pentalpha to an "ILU" Solar
symbol, flanked by bird and reptile, precisely as we find this
combination on the national emblems of Chinese and Japanese today.

What the Swastika Really Is

"It is astonishing how near humanity has come, again and again,
to the real secret of the Swastika, without crossing the line which
exits between conjecture and certainty.

"The Swastika is all that it has been deemed to be and something
more.

"Its symbolic associations with solar motion have been too
remarkable not to have placed it in the category of solar symbols,
but it has remained for us to indicate its true character and a fresh
array of considerations which show it to be far more wonderful than
anything so far surmised.

"No one can fail to recognize its numerical value as a
calendrical symbol suggestive of the revolution of periods of time in
the blocking out on our system of numerical squares of a figure of
four season, twelve months and fifty-two weeks.

"We have entered, in our observations concerning the "Forty-
seventh problem of Euclid" and its far reaching bearings upon the
various geometrical formulae having to do with the Squaring of the
Circle and also determined the reasons which led the ancients to
divide the cube of "Four" (64) into a Solar 36 and a Lunar 28.

"Having ascertained the relative proportions of our Circle of
equal area to our Square of "Sixty-four", blocking the latter out
into a Swastika expressing a year of Fifty-two weeks and supposing it
to be endowed with rotary motion, we see that as it turns, the inner
angles of the arms precisely trace the Circle, so that the Swastika
becomes a most realistic image of the great Cabalistic secret, the
Squaring of the Circle by the heavenly bodies in their annual
revolution.

"The Asiatic form of Swastika, which is double jointed, proves
                                                                        324
to be so constructed that while the inner angle is inscribing the
Circle of equal area, one of the outer ones is tracing that of equal
perimeter or within a small fraction of it.

"A very little reflection will show that while the fundamental
idea of the Swastika begins with the broken "Ilu" square, that it may
be seen in the "Male principle" "Nine" of the Euclid problem, where
even at that low stage of development it serves to connect the Sun
with the creative power.


"The space between the two circles, much used by the devotees of
Eastern religions and philosophical cults to express the realm of
"Chaos" existent between Heaven and the Universe, became in the West
the Zodiacal Circle, receiving the figures from the corresponding
divisions of the earlier Zodiacal Square.
"This arrangement at once confers upon the Swastika the
character of a symbol of the Four Seasons, a device which causes the
second Zodiacal sign, Tarus to fall to a corner place.

"Now we well know from the general position that this lower left
hand corner must correspond with the early part of the year, so if we
are to determine the arms of the Swastika, as the Equinoctial and
Solstitial points, we will see that a still deeper significance is
intended; nothing more nor less than that great cyclical revolution
of the whole Universe, which, at intervals of thousands of years
apart, carries the beginnings of the Equinoxes and Solstices, slowly
from a position of the Sun in one sign of the Zodiac to one in
another.

"Universal chronology and the length of time which separates us
from the beginning of the world, was reckoned on the assumption that
when God created the Universe, He started the great pendulum of Time
swinging, with the Sun in the sign Aires.

"Hence the great esoteric connection of Ram and Lamb with
various religions.

"In the course of several milleniumms, the Spring Equnoticial
arm of the great cosmogonic Swastika had swung around to the sing of
Taurus, the Bull, and this is the main evidence that the great
geometrical revelation took place at some time during the "Tauric"
period, when Circle squareing, the Zodiac and the Swastika, all
coincided as we see them in the following figure.

"The Hon. E. M. Plunkett (Ancient Caldendars and Constellations)
says with regard to this subject--"The beginning of the Median year
was fixed in the season of the Spring Equinox, and remaining true to
that season, followed no star mark.

"'The great importance, however, of Tauric symbolism in Medean
art, seems to point to the fact, that when the equinoctical year was
first established, THE SPRING EQUINOTCIAL POINT WAS IN THE
CONSTELLATION TAURUS.

                                                                        325
"'Astronomy teachers us, that was the case, speaking in round
numbers, from 2000 to 4000 BC.'

"The Swastika "of the double Circle" is even more precise in its
Solar-Lunar numeration than the simpler form, for laid out on a
square of 16x16 or 256, it divides that volume into four arms of 28
each, without counting the centre 4, which added to the spaces
between the arms gives us four sections of 36 each."

And thus ends the book.



Chapter 16--Any Clues In the Magic Square?

Are there any clues to Gann's work in the magic square?

I don't honestly know.

But I do know this. From what we have seen there is no doubt
that the writer's magic square is the very same thing that Gann used
for his Square of Four and I believe you will agree with me that I
have proved it.

There was no clue there as to how Gann used his knowledge of the
magic square for his Square of Four.

But after reading this material on the magic square it gave me
an idea. Maybe it has already given you one!

I used to play around with the Square of Nine (Cycle of Eight).
I reduced the numbers to single digits.

I marked out the teleois numbers.

I also marked out the numbers in sequences of the odd numbers
that make squares. I told how the odd numbers are used to make
squares in Book IV-"One the Square."

So I would mark 1 as 1. Then mark 2, 3, 4, as 1, 2, 3 and then
mark 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, etc. with my last odd
number alternately ending up on the 315 degree line and on the line
one digit short of the 135 degree line.

True, there was a PATTERN there, but it didn't lead to anything
else.

But after reading the material on the magic square and how it
was laid out as opposed to the way Gann laid it out, I got the idea
for laying out the Square of Nine (Cycle of Eight) along the same
PATTERN.

In doing the magic square the writer numbered around until he
reached the 360 degree line and then started numbering at 1 again as
we have seen.
                                                                       326
I have proved to you earlier that the line one unit short of the
315 line, the line that runs down 8, 24, 48, etc. is really the 360
degree line on the Square of Nine (Cycle of Eight) chart and not the
line that runs to the March 20 date.

So I numbered the chart starting at 1 and numbering through 8.
Then I numbered 9 as 1, 10 as 2 and on around to 16. And I did the
rest as shown on the accompanying chart.

                 13    14   15   16   17   18   19    20   21     22   23   24   25
                 12    11   12   13   14   15   16    17   18     19   20   21   26
                 11    10   9    10   11   12   13    14   15     16   17   22   27
                 10    9    8    7    8    9    10    11   12     13   18   23   28
                 9     8    7    6    5    6    7     8    9      14   19   24   29
                 8     7    6    5    4    3    4     5    10     15   20   25   30
                 7     6    5    4    3    2    1     6    11     16   21   26   31
                 6     5    4    3    2    1    8     7    12     17   22   27   32
                 5     4    3    2    1    16   15    14   13     18   23   28   33
                 4     3    2    1    24   23   22    21   20     19   24   29   34
                 3     2    1    32   31   30   29    28   27     26   25   30   35
                 2     1    40   39   38   37   36    35   34     33   32   31   36
                 1     48   47   46   45   44   43    42   41     40   39   38   37

I have colored the cardinal points to just provide a reference.

See anything interesting?

Let's take out the numbers except those on the 45 degree lines
and give it another look.

                 13    x    x    x    x    x    19    x    x      x    x    x    25
                 x     11   x    x    x    x    16    x    x      x    x    21   x
                 x     x    9    x    x    x    13    x    x      x    17   x    x
                 x     x    x    7    x    x    10    x    x      13   x    x    x
                 x     x    x    x    5    x    7     x    9      x    x    x    x
                 x     x    x    x    x    3    4     5    x      x    x    x    x
                 7     6    5    4    3    2    1     6    11     16   21   26   31
                 x     x    x    x    x    1    8     7    x      x    x    x    x
                 x     x    x    x    1    x    15    x    13     x    x    x    x
                 x     x    x    1    x    x    22    x    x      19   x    x    x
                 x     x    1    x    x    x    29    x    x      x    25   x    x
                 x     1    x    x    x    x    36    x    x      x    x    31   x
                 1     x    x    x    x    x    43    x    x      x    x    x    37

The pythagoran over lay on this chart would show that numbers on 45 degree
lines on the cardinal arms will be equal in this manner:
4+6=2+8
7+11=3+15

                                                                                      327
10+16=4+22
ect.

See anything now?

Let's look at the numbers that run straight out to the left
starting with the number 1.

We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.

Now go up to the next 45 degree line and start at 1 again.

We have 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc.

Now go up the next 45 degree line from 1.

We have 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, etc.

Now go up the next 45 degree line from 1.

We have 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, etc.

Then go out to the right on the next 45 degree line from 1.

We have 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, etc.

Then go down on the next 45 degree line from 1.

We have 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, etc.

Then go straight down on the next 45 degree line from 1.

We have 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, etc.

Do you have it now?

The numbers we have seen on these angles are the very same
numbers that are used to make the different sided figures: triangles,
squares, pentagons, hexagons, 7-sided gons, 8-sided gons and 9-sided
gons!

We saw these same figures discussed in my Book VI--"The
Triangular Numbers" which explained how to make the various sided
figures.

Lets review those numbers again from that book:

                         3-Sides     4-Sides       5-Sides     6-Sides
                         Triangle    Square        Pentagon    Hexagon
                         1           1             1           1
                         2           3             4           5
                         3           5             7           9
                         4           7             10          13

                                                                         328
                       5             9             13             17

Since I don't know the names of the other sided figures except
for the octagon we will just call them gons:

                              7-Sided       8-Sided        9-Sided
                              7-Gon         Octagon        9-Gon
                              1             1              1
                              6             7              8
                              11            13             15
                              16            19             22
                              21            25             29

As you can see they are the very same numbers that run on the
angles of the Square of Nine (Cycle of Eight) chart when I redrew the
chart.

Now, let's take out the headings so we can group our numbers a
little closer together:
                                1    1    1    1    1   1    1
                                2    3    4    5    6   7    8
                                3    5    7    9    11 13 15
                                4    7    10 13 16 19 22
                                5    9    13 17 21 25 29
                                6    11 16 21 26 31 36
                                7    13 19 25 31 37 43
                                8    15 22 29 36 43 50

There is a PATTERN here that I noticed when I first looked at
that ancient man's work. Yes I know. There is a PATTERN in the fact
that the first row has a difference of 1 in the numbers and the
second has a difference of 2 in the numbers, etc.

But there is also a couple of other PATTERNS. Look at the
numbers running down from 1, 3, etc. and then note that the numbers
3, 5, 7 also run across the screen. Pick out another column l, 5, 9,
13. Then look at the row 5, 9, 13 going across.

So the numbers are the same going down as they are going across.

Also start with the number 4 in the left hand column and go down
a 45 degree line and we have 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. Squares!

And indeed it seems we have a PATTERN. At least a partial one.
There is something "missing" to make it complete.

Do you see it?

In the first place the columns and rows do not agree. The column
with the 1, 5 is the fourth column and the row that starts with 5 is
of course the fifth row.

                                                                        329
Also when we went down on the 45 degree angle from 4 in which we
saw the squares in order there was no square of 1.

That ancient writer had no 1's in a column to the left of the
present column which contains 1, 2, 3, 4. This would complete the
PATTERN.

But wait!

Look back at the Square of Nine (Cycle of Eight) I have redrawn.
Running down on what used to be the odd squares line is now a series
of 1's.


And if you noticed before we only accounted for 7 of the 8 45-degree angles.

And we can see that if we start with any of those 1's and go
straight up to the March 20 line and on up to the next 45 degree line
and then on around we will also have the numbers to make one of the
gons.

So let's go back to that set of numbers which make the gons and
this time add a column of 1's:

                             1    1     1    1    1      1    1     1
                             1    2     3    4    5      6    7     8
                             1    3     5    7    9      11   13    15
                             1    4     7    10   13     16   19    22
                             1    5     9    13   17     21   25    29
                             1    6     11   16   21     26   31    36
                             1    7     13   19   25     31   37    43
                             1    8     15   22   29     36   43    50

And now our PATTERN is complete. The numbers running down the
columns correspond to the same number row going across. Also we have
a square of 1 to go down the 45 degree line, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.

So we have done something here that even that old ancient writer
didn't do, we supplied a column of 1's to make the PATTERN complete.

But can we prove that a column of 1's should be there?

You might recall in my discussion of the different gons in my
book on the triangular numbers that there was an easy way to find out
what numbers should be used to make up any gon.

I said that even though the ancient writer never pointed it out
I had discovered that easy way.

You simply use a difference in numbers that is two less than the
side of the gon you want to make.


                                                                               330
If you wanted to make a 33-gon (a 33-sided figure) you would
subtract 2 from 33 and get 31 and that would be the difference in
numbers starting with 1 that would be needed to make a 33-sided
figure. In other words you would start with 1 and add 31 to get the
next number which is 32 and then add 31 to 32 to get the next number
or 63.

We can see that easier with the square. The square, a 4-gon, has
4 sides. So if we subtract 2 from 4 we get 2, which is the difference
in numbers starting at 1 that we use to make the squares. So 1 plus 2
is 3 and 3 plus 2 is 5. And 1, 3, 5, etc. are the numbers we add
together to make the squares.

Then there is the triangle, a 3-gon. It has 3 sides so we
subtract 2 from 3 and get 1 and 1 is the difference in numbers that
we use to find the numbers to make the triangle or triangular
numbers. Starting at 1 we add 1 to get 2 and add 1 to 2 and get 3,
etc. And those numbers, 1, 2, 3 are the numbers we add to get the
triangular numbers.

Now since our series of 1's come just before the triangle we
must be finding a two-sided figure, a two-gon. So we subtract 2 from
2 and get 0 or zero and this is the difference in the numbers used to
make the two-sided figure. So starting at 1 we add 0 and get 1, add 0
and get 1, etc. So you see we get a series of 1's since the
difference is 0.

Now there may not be any geometrical figures with two sides in
actuality, but we have proved in theory that there is a two-sided
figure and it is made with a series of 1's.

AND THAT MAKES UP OUR NUMBERING SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL UNITS!

And we have proved something that the ancient writer never told
us. But like the Bible and Gann said, "Prove all things."

We have also discovered something else.

The Missing Link!



Chapter 17-The Miss ing Link
You might recall that earlier in this book that I showed how the
different cycles of numbers could be made.

If we wanted to make the cycle of four we could do it like in
the example below:

                                       1     6    15    28
                                       2     8    18    32
                                       3     10   21    36
                                       4     12   24    40

                                                                        331
In the case above we made this cycle based on triangular
difference of numbers in the columns. We showed this by putting the
numbers that make up the triangular numbers over the columns like so:

                                        1     2    3     4
                                        1     6    15    28
                                        2     8    18    32
                                        3     10   21    36
                                        4     12   24    40

And we saw that the 360 degree line along the bottom was 4 times
the triangles in order 4x1, 4x3 (three is the triangle of 2), 4x6 (6
is the triangle of 3) and 4x10 (10 is the triangle of 4).

And if we wanted to make up a cycle based on the numbers that
make up "squares" such as Gann's Square of Four we would do it like
this:

                                        1     3    5     7
                                        1     7    21    43
                                        2     10   26    50
                                        3     13   31    57
                                        4     16   36    64

And we can see along the bottom that the numbers are 4 times the
squares in order 4x1, 4x4, 4x9, 4x16.

You might remember that I said in Chapter 8 that I had a problem
with a "regular" square though since there were no "gon" numbers to make
a regular square. But now we know there are!

And we can see that if we put the numbers that make the 2-gon
across the top of our square. I had mentioned a square of 12. But any
other square can me made the same so again we will use a 4:

                                        1     1    1     1
                                        1     5    9     13
                                        2     6    10    14
                                        3     7    11    15
                                        4     8    12    16

So the difference between the numbers in any column is 1 and our
missing link has been found!




                                                                           332
Chapter 18-Red Flag! Number 325!

When I find PATTERNS, I start looking for other PATTERNS. For
some reason I started counting down on the 45 degree angle that goes
straight down from 1 through 8, etc. As I added the numbers I came to
325.

That sent up a red flag.

You might recall that Gann mentioned the number 325 and said the
cycle changes here where two 45 degree lines cross. I never could
understand what he meant by that, but here was that number again. And
then when I went on down with the count I ended up at 1089 and that
is the square of 33 (33X33-1089) and that is where the chart ends.
Hmmmm. Very interesting.

So, I added the numbers again. That is the numbers that run from
1 through 8 and straight on down. This time I checked out the answers
each time I added a number.

Are you still with me. Let's add them and see where the answers
fall on the Square of Nine chart (the Cycle of 8):
The first column are the numbers running down from 1 through 8, etc. The
second column is a running total as we add.

                                         1       1
                                         8       9
                                         15      24
                                         22      46
                                         29      75
                                         36      111
                                         43      154
                                         50      204
                                         57      261
                                         64      325
                                         71      396
                                         78      474
                                         85      559
                                         92      661
                                         99      760
                                         106     866
                                         113     979
                                         120     1089

Did you follow the answers on the Square of Nine chart?

Did you see anything interesting?

You might have noticed that all the answers fell on a 22.5
degree angle or 45 degree angle (which is 22.5 degrees from the
                                                                           333
22.5 angle).

They fell counter clockwise on the angles.

And each time the numbers went out one square and hit on the
next 22.5 degree angle. Let's look at that. In the right hand column
I have put in the number of the angle:

                            Number           Total        Angle
                            1                1            315
                            8                9            315
                            15               24           292.5
                            22               46           270
                            29               75           247.5
                            36               111          225
                            43               154          202.5
                            50               204          180
                            57               261          157.5
                            64               325          135
                            71               396          112.5
                            78               474          90
                            85               559          67.5
                            92               661          45
                            99               760          22.5
                            106              866          360
                            113              979          337.5
                            120              1089         315

Note that the first two numbers are on the same angle as the
last number and we are back to where we started.
As I was doing this I noticed that when I added 64 which is the
square of 8, I came to 325 and 325 is 180 degrees from 1089. That led
to another possible PATTERN.



Chapter 19-Ans wers on the Diagonal
I remembered that when I wanted to find a diagonal of a square
in my mind, I simply added 1 less than the square root each time and
I would be on a number on the diagonal. I discussed this in
Book VIII-"The Single Digit Numbering System."


It goes something like this. If you want to find the diagonal of
a square such as 8, you would add 7 to that and get 15, the next
number on the diagonal and add 7 to 15 and get 22 which is the next
number on the diagonal, etc.

Since these are the same numbers we used for finding the numbers
on the Square of Nine we could come up with another PATTERN.

                                                                        334
So let's put down a regular square of eight:

                             1    9     17     25    33    41    49   57
                             2    10    18     26    34    42    50   58
                             3    11    19     27    35    43    51   59
                             4    12    20     28    36    44    52   60
                             5    13    21     29    37    45    53   61
                             6    14    22     30    38    46    54   62
                             7    15    23     31    39    47    55   63
                             8    16    24     32    40    48    56   64

You recall that the numbers we used to add to get the numbers on
the square of 9 that got us to 325 were:

1
8
15
22
29
36
43
50
57
64

So looking at our regular square we can find these same numbers.

As we can see the numbers we added to find the numbers on the
Square of nine are the 1 at the top, the 8 at the bottom and the
numbers on the diagonal 15, 22, etc. up to 59 and then 64 at the
bottom. (I have colored them to make it easier to grasp.)

As I said before these numbers added up to 325 which was 180
degrees from 1089 so I extended the square of 8 until I ended up at
1089. The extension is seen below:

     1     9     17    25    33    41    49     57        65    73    81   89   97    105   113
     2     10    18    26    34    42    50     58        66    74    82   90   98    106   114
     3     11    19    27    35    43    51     59        67    75    83   91   99    107   115
     4     12    20    28    36    44    52     60        68    76    84   92   100   108   116
     5     13    21    29    37    45    53     61        69    77    85   93   101   109   117
     6     14    22    30    38    46    54     62        70    78    86   94   102   110   118
     7     15    23    31    39    47    55     63        71    79    87   95   103   111   119
     8     16    24    32    40    48    56     64        72    80    88   96   104   112   120

We can see if we draw another diagonal starting at 64 and going
up through 71, 78, etc. it will go up to 113. Then if we add 120 at
the end of the series of numbers we will come to 1089. To recap add 1
to the 8 and then the numbers on the diagonal to 57, then add the 64
and the numbers on the diagonal up to 113 and then add 120 we will

                                                                                                  335
have added up to 1089.

And every time we add a number we find ourselves on one of the
22.5 angles on the Square of Nine chart!

So here was another PATTERN.

I wondered if I could use the PATTERN on any series of numbers.

I had noticed something when I looked at the series above. Maybe
you have already seen it.

I noticed that the last number in the series was 120. And that
number is the triangle of 15. I noticed in the first column that the
last two numbers were 7 and 8 and when added they equal 15. Then I
noticed that the total number of columns is also 15.

I wondered if the same PATTERN would hold for another series of
numbers.

So let's recap what we have learned about our "rectangle of
eight" above:

The numbers used on the square of nine chart were the numbers
that make up a 9-gon that when added gave us the numbers on the
Square of Nine chart that fell on the angles.

Those angles were the 22.5 degree angles, which is 360 degrees
divided by 16 and 16 is 2 times 8.

When we added 64, the square of 8 to our series we arrived at
the 180 degree point (325 is 180 degrees of 1089).

On our rectangle we added 1 to 8 and then the numbers on the
diagonal up to the top and then went down to 64 and added that and
then we added the numbers on that diagonal up to 113 and then added
120 to end the series.

We noted that the last number in the series was 120 which is the
triangle of 15 and noted that the last two numbers in the first
column 7 and 8 added to 15 and that there were 15 columns.

So our series of numbers should follow that same PATTERN if we
use another series of numbers.



Chapter 20-Checking It Out on the Hexagon

We saw earlier that the Square of Nine, Octagon, Cycle of Eight
or 9-gon chart, call it what you like but I will call it the Square
of Nine since that is what it is commonly called, and the Hexagon
chart are constructed in the same manner.

It is also a chart we have at hand so we can check our results
                                                                       336
against it. So let's put down a rectangle of 6.

Let's look at the first column of numbers:

1
2
3
4
5
6
We can see that the last two numbers are 5 and 6 and 5 plus 6 is
eleven so if we were right about the rectangle of 8, then in the
rectangle of 6 we should have 11 columns and the last number in the
column will be the triangle of 11 which is 66.

And that is pretty evident since there are 6 in each row and 11
across would be 66. So let's put down the whole rectangle.

                     1     7    13    19    25    31   37   43    49   55   61
                     2     8    14    20    26    32   38   44    50   56   62
                     3     9    15    21    27    33   39   45    51   57   63
                     4     10   16    22    28    34   40   46    52   58   64
                     5     11   17    23    29    35   41   47    53   59   65
                     6     12   18    24    30    36   42   48    54   60   66

Now I will let you do the adding. Add the 1 to the 6 and get
seven and then add the numbers on the diagonal 11,16, 21, 26 and 31.
Then drop down and add 36. And then add the numbers on the diagonal
up through 41, 46, 51, 56 and 61 and then go down and add 66.

Look at your numbers on the Hexagon chart as you make each
addition. What happened?

Exactly what it did on the Square of Nine Chart! The numbers
fell on an angle. This time they fell on the 30 degree angles. And
each time they went out to the next square or circle or hexagon,
which ever way you want to call it.

So we have seen that the same PATTERN works for both the Square
of Nine and the Hexagon Chart.



Chapter 21-Same PATTERN On Other Charts
We don't have any other charts to check our work, but we can be
assured that the same PATTERN would exist for any other chart if we
could draw out those charts.

Remember that what ever number PATTERN we use the PATTERN will
be for the "gon" which is one more unit than the rectangle we are
using. The "8" rectangle makes the 9-gon and the "6" rectangle makes
the 7-gon since the numbers we are using make those gons.


                                                                                 337
Let's review the numbers that make the polygons again.

The sides of the polygon go across the top. The numbers under
those are the numbers used to make the polygon. For example under 4,
a four-sided figure or a square, the numbers are 1, 3, 5, etc. When
added they made squares. 1 is the square of 1. 1 plus 3 is 4, the
square of 2. l plus 3 plus 5 is 9, the square of 3, etc.

                              2    3     4        5        6        7    8    9
                              1    1     1        1        1        1    1    1
                              1    2     3        4        5        6    7    8
                              1    3     5        7        9        11   13   15
                              1    4     7        10       13       16   19   21
                              1    5     9        13       17       21   25   29
                              1    6     11       16       21       26   31   36
                              1    7     13       19       25       31   37   43
                              1    8     15       22       29       36   43   50
                              1    9     17       25       33       41   49   57
                              1    10    19       28       37       46   55   64

Note: If you know the last term such as 64 above, you can add 1,
divide by 2 and multiply it by the number of terms and get the
answer, the same as if you had added them. Take 64 and add 1 to get
65. Divide by 2 to get 32.5 and multiply by 10 and get 325. This is
the same as adding all the numbers under the 9-gon. I had known this
for squares, but had not known it earlier that it worked for all the
polygons!

Now, let's do a few more rectangles. Remember we start with a
square and when we reach the end of the square we are on the 180
degree angle. And then we extend our square to make a rectangle. The
last number in our rectangle will be always be a triangular number.
And that number will be the triangle of the sum of our "square" or
"rectangular" number plus 1 less than that square. In the case of the
8 it was the triangle of 8 plus (8-1) or 7 or the triangle of 15.

For 2 it would be the triangle of 2 plus (2-1) or 1 or the
triangle of 3 which is 6. So let's look at some of those rectangles:

                                              1        3        5
                                              2        4        6

                                         1        4    7    10 13
                                         2        5    8    11 14
                                         3        6    9    12 15

We can see that the last number in the 2-rectangle is the
triangle of 3 and the last number in the 3-rectangle is the triangle
of 5. We see here a PATTERN that the triangles will always be a
triangle of an odd number since when we add 1 and 2 we get 3, when we
add 2 and 3 we get 5. So the next rectangle, the one of four, should

                                                                                   338
have the triangle of 7 at the end since 3 and 4 are 7.

And we see below that we were right!

                                     1        5     9    13   17   21   25
                                     2        6     10   14   18   22   26
                                     3        7     11   15   19   23   27
                                     4        8     12   16   20   24   28


It is the triangle of 7. Again note that in each of these three
groups the root of the triangle came be found by adding the last two
numbers in the first row. 1 plus 2 is 3. 2 plus 3 is 5. 3 plus 4 is
7. And the triangle of 3 is 6, the triangle of 5 is 15 and the
triangle of 7 is 28.

And we had 3 columns, 5 columns and 7 columns.

Now let's list some other rectangles:

                            1        6        11    16   21   26   31    36    41
                            2        7        12    17   22   27   32    37    42
                            3        8        13    18   23   28   33    38    43
                            4        9        14    19   24   29   34    39    44
                            5        10       15    20   25   30   35    40    45

Yes it works. 4 plus 5 is 9 which is the root of the triangle of 45 and
there are 9 columns.

Now, we'll do the 8-gon.

                  1    8        15       22    29   36   43   50   57   64    71    78   85
                  2    9        16       23    30   37   44   51   58   65    72    79   86
                  3    10       17       24    31   38   45   52   59   66    73    80   87
                  4    11       18       25    32   39   46   53   60   67    74    81   88
                  5    12       19       26    33   40   47   54   61   68    75    82   89
                  6    13       20       27    34   41   48   55   62   69    76    83   90
                  7    14       21       28    35   42   49   56   63   70    77    84   91

I colored just half here. Let you figure out the rest.



Chapter 22-The Numbers on the Angles
I have done this work to show you the relationship of a
rectangle of numbers to the polygons and how the polygon numbers fall
on the angles on the Square of Nine Chart and on the Hexagon Chart.
Earlier we put down the numbers and put the angles out at the side to
show how they fell on the individual angles and then came back to the
angle where they started.

                                                                                              339
Let's look at the work we did on the 9-gon, the work that gave
us the angles for the Square of Nine or Cycle of Eight or Octagon.

Number         Total           Angle
1              1               315

36             111             225
43             154             202.5
50             204             180
57             261             157.5
64             325             135
71             396             112.5
78             474             90
85             559             67.5
92             661             45
99             760             22.5
106            866             360
113            979             337.5
120            1089            315

As we did the 7-gon, Cycle of Six or Hexagon, I had you follow
the results on the angles. Let's put those down.

                                         1       1       360
                                         6       7       360
                                         11      18      30
                                         16      34      60
                                         21      55      90
                                         26      81      120
                                         31      112     150
                                         36      148     180
                                         41      189     210
                                         46      235     240
                                         51      286     270
                                         56      342     300
                                         61      403     330
                                         66      469     360

Look in the first column and count the number of terms both for
the 9-gon and the 7-gon.

In the 9-gon, Cycle of 8, it takes 10 terms to get to the square
of 8 or 64 and it takes 18 terms to get to the end.

In the 7-gon, the Cycle of 6, it takes 8 terms to get to 36 the
                                                                     340
square of 6 and 14 terms to get to the end.

PATTERN?

Yes. We can see that in the Cycle of 6 it takes 8 terms to get
to 36 and 8 is two more than the cycle number, which is 6. And we see
that in the Cycle of 6 it take 14 terms to get to the end and 14 is
two times the cycle number, which is 6, plus 2, that is 12 plus 2.

We can see that in the Cycle of 8 it takes 10 terms to get to 64
and 10 is 2 more than the cycle number of 8. And to get to the end
takes 18 terms which is 2x8 plus 2.

And we have noticed that the amount of angles the numbers will
fall on is twice the cycle number. In the cycle of 8 the numbers fell
on 16 angles and on the cycle of 6 the numbers fell on 12 angles.

So the number of angles our results will fall on will be twice
the cycle number.

So with that in mind we could make up a whole list of cycles
without having to lay out a rectangle.

And there are several things we will know before we start:

(1) The numbers we use to make up the cycles will be for the
"gons" which are 1 unit more than the cycle. For the Cycle of 8 we
would use the numbers that make up the 9-gon, etc.

(2) The number of terms to make the complete cycle will be 2
times the cycle number plus 2. In the case of the Cycle of 8 it was
18 which is 2x8 plus 2.

(3) When we reach the half-way point, the 180 degree line, we
will be adding the square of the cycle number and the number of terms
to reach that square will be two more than the cycle number. In the
case of the Cycle of 8 it will be 8+2 or 10 terms.

(4) The number of angles we will have will be 2 times the cycle
number. In the case of the Cycle of 8 it will be 16.

(5) The first two numbers will both be on the 360 degree line
and the last number will be on the 360 degree line.



Chapter 23-Some Other Cycles
So now let's make up some cycles and see how they follow the
things we know.

So, the 5-gon would represent the Cycle of four and there would
be 8 45-degree lines.

Like the 7-gon we will start with the 0 or 360 degree line:

                                                                        341

                                        19      70     225
                                        22      92     270
                                        25      117    325
                                        28      145    360

Now, let's do the 3-gon (the Cycle of 2). The answers will fall
on the four 90-degree angles:

                                        1       1      360
                                        2       3      360
                                        3       6      90
                                        4       10     180
                                        5       15     270
                                        6       21     360




Chapter 24-Why the Square of 9 Chart Ends at 1089!
After going back over the material I finally discovered why
Gann's Square of Nine chart (the Cycle of 8) ends at 1089 (the square
of 33).

We can see that when we did the 9-gon and came back to the 315
degree angle we were at 1089. At first I thought that was just
coincidental. But looking at the 7-gon (the cycle of six or the
hexagon chart, it dawned on me that both of them follow the same
PATTERN.

On the 9-gon 1089 is 8 times 136 plus 1 and 136 is the triangle
of 16 which is 2 times 8!

On the 7-gon 469 is 6 times 78 plus 1 and 78 is the triangle of
12 and 12 is 2 times 6!

So the final number in our examples above is always the cycle
number times the triangle of double the cycle number plus 1.

In our 3-gon above the cycle number is 2. We find the triangle
of double that number (4) which is 10. Multiply times 2 and add 1 and
we have 21 for our final number.

In the 5-gon the cycle number is 4. We find the triangle of
double that number (8) which is 36. Multiply by 4 and add 1 and we
have 145 which is the final number in that series.
                                                                        342
Let's do the 4-gon (cycle of 3). Before we even do it we will
know that its ending number will be the triangle of six times 3 plus
1. The triangle of 6 is 21. Three times that is 63 and when we add 1
we get 64. Since this is the Cycle of 3 we will have six 60 degree
angles.

Again the first two numbers and the last number will both fall
on the same angle so there are more than six numbers below:

                                          1      1     360
                                          3      4     360
                                          5      9     60
                                          7      16    120
                                          9      25    180
                                          11     36    240
                                          13     49    300
                                          15     64    360

We were right when we said our ending number would be 64.

Let's do the 6-gon:

                                          1      1     360
                                          5      6     360
                                          9      15    36
                                          13     28    72
                                          17     45    108
                                          21     66    144
                                          25     91    180
                                          29     120   216
                                          33     153   252
                                          37     190   288
                                          41     231   324
                                          45     276   360

Gann had a square of 20. Let's have a look at that:

                                          1      1     360
                                          20     21    360
                                          39     60    9
                                          58     118   18
                                          77     195   27
                                          96     291   36
                                          115    406   45
                                          134    540   54

I just did the first few to give you the idea.

                                                                       343
And I will let you work that last one out and see how it adheres
to the four things "we knew" earlier.

Remember that all this works with cycles that are based on the
triangular system. I showed earlier how the Cycle of 8 and the Cycle
of 6 were based on the triangular numbers.

I tried to find something that would work on the Square of Four,
but could not. Remember that the Square of Four works off the squares
and the Cycle of 4 works off the triangular numbers.

Was Gann aware of the work that you have seen here? I don't
know. Maybe I have stumble on something he didn't know. Could he have
used it without knowing about it? I don't know. But the PATTERNS of
the numbers falling on the angles in all the "gons" is very
interesting and requires further study.



Chapter 25--The Squares of Nine and 33

In Chapter 9 of his commodity course Gann describes the Square
of Nine noting the 90 degree angles that his numbers fall on.

Then later he describes the Square of 33, which seems to be just
an extension of the Square of 9. This square of 33 ends at 1089 and
in his description of soybean prices his numbers never reach near
that far.

Why didn't he just extend the Square of Nine out to where he
needed it. His highest soybean number at that time was 436, just
short of 441, or the square of 21.

That's because there is a numerical relationship between his
Square of Nine, which he ran out to 19x19 and the square of 33 or
33x33.

Maybe you have already figured it out. Maybe after seeing all
the work that we have done up to this point you have figured it out!

I would never have figured it out if I had not done the work
described in the last few chapters.

But the fact that the 9-gon work we did with the last number
being 1089 or the square of 33 finally tipped me off.

I had known for a long time that there was a possible
relationship with the triangle of 4 and the triangle of 8 and we know
that 8 is two times 4.

We know that the triangle of 4 is 10 and the triangle of twice
that number or 8 is 36. And when they are multiplied we get 360. The
360 degrees in a circle!

But the answer to how the square of 19 and the square of 33
                                                                        344
dovetailed did not dawn on me for awhile.

Until I added the 1!

The triangle of 10 times the triangle of 8 is 360. and when you
add the 1 you get 361 or 19x19.

We saw earlier that the triangle of 16 is 136 and 8 times that
is 1088. And when you add the 1 you get 1089 which is where the 9-gon
ends.

Have you got it now?

Lets put our two things under each other.

Triangle of 4 times triangle of 8 plus 1 is 361.
8 times the triangle of 16 plus 1 is 1089.

Both of the answers then end up on the same angle, in this case
they end up on the angle of 315 the way Gann has laid out the Square
of Nine, but we have seen that the numbers could be changed so that
they end up on the 360 degree line.

If we look at each of our gons we will see that they all end at
a number which is a number times the triangle of twice that number
plus 1.

And remember that in our gons we are using numbers which are 1
less thag the gon number. In the case of the 9-gon our numbers were
based on "8".

In the 7-gon our numbers are based on "6."

So let's look at the 7-gon again and do with it what we did with
the 9-gon.

Since our number is 6 we can see that it ends at:

6 times the triangle of 12, then add 1.

The triangle of 12 is 78 and six times that is 468 and when we
add the 1 we get 469.

And when we look at our 7-gon work (the cycle of 6) we can see
that we are right. It does end at 469.

                                          1        1     360
                                          6        7     360
                                          11       18    30
                                          16       34    60
                                          21       55    90
                                          26       81    120
                                          31       112   150

                                                                        345
                                         36    148     180
                                         41    189     210
                                         46    235     240
                                         51    286     270
                                         56    342     300
                                         61    403     330
                                         66    469     360


We can even see we are right with the simple 3-gon. The number
is 2. And 2 and 2 times 2 is 4. The triangle of 4 is 10. Two times 10
is 20 and when we add the 1 we have 21 and our 3-gon ended at 21.

You can work on the rest of the gons and see that they all
follow this same PATTERN.

We saw on the 9-gon (the Cycle of 8) that 8 times the triangle
of 16 plus 1 (1089) ended on the same angle as the triangle of 4
times the triangle of 8 plus 1 (361).

So now that we have seen how the last number in our gons ended
on the number times the triangle of twice the number plus 1, let's
see if we can also find that other number like the 361 on the cycle
of 8.

With the 7-gon we use the number 6.

Half of 6 is 3 and the triangle of 3 is 6. The triangle of 6 is
21 and 6 times 21 is 126. Then we add the 1 and we have 127. And we
can see on the Hexagon that 127 ends up on the same angle as 469.

So the PATTERN works. And we can compare the PATTERNS of the
Cycle of 8 and the Cycle of 6.

Triangle of 4 (10) times Triangle of 8 (36)+1=361
8 times the Triangle of 16 (136)+1=1089.
Now we just substitute the numbers 3 and 6 in the first line:

Triangle of 3 (6) times the Triangle of 6 (21)+1=127

Now we just substitute the numbers 6 and 12 in the second line:

6 times the Triangle of 12 (78)+1=469.

That PATTERN would work with all our gons if we could draw them
out in the same way the Square of Nine (the Cycle of 8) and the
Hexagon (Cycle of 6) are drawn out.

To find out what triangle of a number times the triangle of
double that number plus 1 falls on the same angle as a number times
the triangle of double that number plus 1, just substitue the
appropriate numbers as I did above.


                                                                        346
Some examples:

The triangle of 1 times the triangle of 2 (plus 1)=4
2 times the triangle of 4 (plus 1)=21

The triangle of 2 times the triangle of 4 (plus 1)=31
4 times the triangle of 8 (plus 1)=145.

That will get you started. I think you can take it from there.

What have we learned from all this? Did Gann know this?
How did he use it?

I don't know how he used it. But I am sure he must have been
aware of the things we have found.

The fact that the Square of Nine ends at 1089 I believe is the
proof that he did know it.

His Hexagon does not end at 469 as we might suspect, but I think
that is the logical end of it. Why it is extended to the point where
it is is anybody's guess.

How does this fit in with Gann's Square of Four chart.

Remember that Gann's Cycle of 8 and Cycle of 6 are based on the
triangular numbers and his Square of Four is based on square numbers.

We have seen that using the various gons which are made up of
numbers so many units apart work out the angles on the cycle charts
which themselves are based on triangular numbers.

I could not find a similar operation that would work on the
Square of Four.

But I did find this.

You remember how I found the end of the cycles above (the end of
the cycle of 8 was 8 times the triangle of 16) and how I found that
the triangle of 4 times the triangle of 8 was found on the same
angle. I added 1 to each of those to put them on the odd squares of
19x19 And 33x33. I could have left off the 1 and they would still
have been on a 360 degree angle.

I showed a little formula for that.

Triangle of 4 times the Triangle of 8 (+1)=361
8 times the Triangle of 16 (+1)=1089.
If I left off the 1 the numbers would be 360 and 1088, but they
would still be on the same angle.

I also suggested that other numbers could be substituted with
the same results on their respective cycles.

For the cycle of 4 it would be:
                                                                        347
Triangle of 2 times the Triangle of 4
4 times the triangle of 8.

Now the interesting part is this:

If we substitute the word square for triangle above then we
would have the same results on the Square of Four (not to be confused
with the Cycle of 4 above)

Square of 2 times the Square of 4=64
4 times the Square of 8=256

And both of these are on the same 360 degree on the Square of
Four!

This also means that under our formula the logical ending place
for this square is 256. The square that comes with your Gann material
ends at the square of 34 and 256 is only the square of 16.

But this logical ending of 256 can be seen in the Gann material.
On page 142 in the "old" course (page 135 in the Master Egg Course
which is a supplement marked with a large 9 in the back of the "new"
course) he speaks of prices working out to the square of 16 which is on time.
See the Egg Chart in Section 9 and you will see that the circle goes out to
256. In the course it says on time at 250, but I believe this is a mistake and
he meant 256.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this material. Maybe you can
take what I have written here and dovetail it with your own work to
come up with the solution to Gann's esoteric work.

Like I said at the beginning my aim was not to give you
something to make a million dollars in the market in the morning as I
don't have the entire solution to Gann's work.

But I believe you will agree with me that I have opened a lot of
doors for those who want to go in and search around. Maybe the
missing piece is behind one of those doors.

I keep learning new things every so often so look in the
appendix for other goodies.

Appendix

Appendix 1
Gann's 24-Hour "Error"

The Gann material is full of errors. Why, I don't know. It could
be that his original material had faded and the person or persons who
did the copying to put out the Gann material couldn't read it and
guessed at what Gann was saying.

Some errors are quite obvious. At one point Gann says there are
560 degrees in a circle when we know there are 360.

Also if you check the work on eggs and the relationship to the
Square of Four chart you will find a number of errors when the time
numbers are multiplied by 5. Check the figures in that section (on
page l43 in my material).

If the copying work was done right and there is what appears to
be an error I am led to believe that Gann made the error as a clue or
because he wanted us to think out the real answer.

Let's look at one of those "mistakes."

Look at the section entitled "Master 360-Degree Square of 12
Chart for Eggs." It is page 129 in my material.

Now read the second paragraph, "The earth makes one revolution
on its axis every 24 hours and moves one cycle of 560 degrees."

Both of us would probably agree that the 560 degrees is a
mistake and we would probably change it to 360 degrees.

Then it would read that the earth turns 360 degrees in 24 hours.
Right? That's something I accepted for a long time as there seemed no
possible disagreement with the statement. Probably many others have
also accepted it.

But let's check it out.

Let's say you are sitting on the earth looking south. Or let's
just say I am, and you are sitting here beside me in Paris, Tenn. For
illustration let's say we are on a high hill so we have a good view.

Let's draw a meridian from the north pole to the south pole and
let it run right through the middle of my head, between my eyes and
down my nose. (There are many meridians on the earth, the prime
meridian in London and others that divide the earth east to west by
drawing lines from the north pole to the south pole. But any location
                                                                        349
on the earth can represent a meridian drawn from north to south.

Now, let's wait for the sun to get right on our meridian. Let's
pretend we can look right at the sun and that we can also see that
north to south line that runs down my nose, out into space and on
around to the south pole.

So, we see the sun get on the meridian and I check my watch.

I tell you it is 12 noon. You check my watch and agree.

Then we wait for the earth to spin us around and the next day we
are in our same positions. The sun touches our meridian. I show you
my watch again. It is 12 noon, 24 hours from 12 noon yesterday.
Next day we are at it again. Again the sun is on the meridian
and again we check my watch. Again it is 12 noon and another 24 hours
has passed.

Conclusion?

It must be 24 hours from the time the sun is on a meridian until
it is on the same meridian again. (Because the earth does not run in
an exact circle but in an ellipse and because it is sometimes nearer
the sun than at other times which makes the earth run faster and the
sun seems to move faster, the sun might be off this meridian just a
bit, but for our purposes we will pretend it does not).

So we have established the fact that from one time the sun is on
the meridian until the next time it is on the meridian, 24 hours have
passed.

And since the earth made a revolution it must have gone 360
degrees in those 24 hours, right?

Let's check it out.

Again let's pretend that the sun is a small light in the sky and
we can look right at it. Let's also pretend that there is a circle
around the earth and it is divided off into degrees and the number of
degrees are written right in the sky and the sun sits on those
degrees like a red chip on a black number on a roulette table.

We will start with the sun on the meridian at 12 o'clock and the
sun is on the number 360. Now the earth turns a full day and our
meridian comes back to the number 360, having made 360 degrees and
there is the sun.

Whoa, wait a minute. The sun is not there! What happened to the
sun?

Oh, there it is, on the number next to 360, the number 1.

Quick, check the watch! It's not noon yet. It is 11:56.

Must be some kind of mistake. Let's try it again.
                                                                        350
Our meridian is still on 360. The earth turns and the next day
our meridian comes back to 360 so the earth has turned 360 degrees.

But the sun is now over on number 2! Quick, the watch again! The
time now is 11:52.

What's going on?

The earth not only turns on its axis, but it also goes around
the sun. It moves approximately one degree a day. But if we were in
the center of the earth as in a crystal ball and could look out at
the sun it would seem that the sun was moving instead of the earth.
And it would seem to move in a circle against that imaginary
background of numbers we have drawn in the sky. And it would seem to
move one degree a day.

So now we can answer our question. Does the earth turn 360
degrees in 24 hours? The answer is no.

Let's go back once again to our meridian line. It is 12 noon and
the sun is over the number 360 in the sky. The earth turns and brings
our meridian back to the 360 degree marker which means we have turned
360 degrees. Our watch reads 11.56. But while the earth was turning
it was also moving 1 degree around the sun or the sun seem to move to
the 1 degree marker.

So now our meridian must move one more degree to get the sun on
the meridian. So we wait for the earth to turn one more degree and
check our watch. Now it reads 12 noon.

And our meridian is on the 1 degree marker along with the sun.
So now let's ride the earth another day. It turns on its axis and
comes back to the 1 degree marker, which means we have turned 360
degrees. But the sun is now on the 2 degree marker and the earth and
our meridian has to turn one more degree to get on the number 2
marker with the sun and the time is 12 noon.


PATTERN?

From the time the sun is on the meridian until the next time it
is on the meridian is 24 hours. But each time the earth turns 360
degrees it has to go another degree to get the sun on the meridian so
the revolution of the earth in 24 hours is not 360 degrees as Gann
says, but it is

361 degrees

or

19x19

or

                                                                        351
The Square of 19!

Now to answer a couple of questions you might have. Why does the
earth have to turn one more degree to put the sun on the meridian and
why do we call that 24 hours.

If it did not turn another degree then the hours of the day in
relation to the sun would be all off.

Let's pretend that many years ago the powers that be who decided
on a 24-hour day said that those 24 hours would be based on a 360
degree turning of the earth which brings the meridian right back to
the same point in the sky. Let's also pretend that you and I have our
noon day meal at straight up 12 o'clock.

Now the earth turns 360 degrees and brings the meridian back to
the same place in the sky and we have our meal. But the sun is one
degree away from the meridian.

We repeat the process next day, but the sun is now two degrees
away from the meridian and after about 90 days we would be eating our
noonday meal just as the sun is coming up in the east and after 180
days we would be eating our noon day meal in complete darkness as the
sun would be opposite on the other side of the earth!

So to keep the sun in step with our 24-hour habits, 12 noon
would have to be when the sun is on the meridian and the only way
that can happen is for the earth to turn one more degree after making
its 360 degree turn to put the meridian on the sun which has moved a
degree because the earth has actually gone 1 degree in its path
around the sun.

Quick now! How many revolutions does the earth turn on its axis
in 365 days?
It turns 366 since it turns an extra degree a day and at the end
of 365 days it has made an extra revolution.

Is this the "year for a day" in the Bible? Is it the year for a
day used in astrology? Don't know but it is worth some study.

Gann said that the smallest unit of time that he used was 4
minutes. Let's see where that comes from.

There are 24 hours in a day so 24x60=1440 minutes. We divided by
360 and get 4 minutes which is the time it takes for the earth to
turn 1 degree.

Since the time from the sun to be on the meridian until the next
time it is on the meridian is 24 hours, then when the earth turns
back to the 360 degree marker in the sky, before it goes another
degree to put the sun on the meridian, there is a difference of 4
minutes. That is why when we checked our watch after the earth turned
360 degrees the first time, the time was 11:56 and the next time it
was 11:52.

                                                                        352
The time that it takes for the meridian to get back to the same
point in the sky or to turn 360 degrees is called "star time" as it
is the time it takes to get back to the same point in relation to a
distant star. What star that is makes no difference, it is just a
reference point in the sky. We could say that if we could use the
meridian like a carpenter's chalk string and draw it back and let it
hit the sky and make a large chalk mark, that would be our point.

Another name given to this time is "sidereal time."

In the early days of my Gann studies I found out that Gann used
astrology. So I went to the library for astrology books. I ran into
that thing called "sidereal time." The folks who wrote those books
knew what they were talking about, but I found the explanation hard
to understand. Over the years I ran into it time after time.

There was even a column in my ephemeris called Sidereal time.
Still could not quite get the hang of it. So I never questioned
Gann's statement that the earth turns 360 degrees in 24 hours. But I
finally got the idea about star time and sun time and their
difference.

That shed a new light on his statement.

I'm sure there are many of you out there who know about sidereal
time, but for those who don't I hope that my explanation was much
simpler than the ones I have read in various books.

After finally getting it set in my mind, I recently ran across a
book which explained it much in the manner I have explained it here.
You might want to take a look at it if you can find it in your
library.

It is called "The Clock We Live on" by Isaac Asimov. Most of you
will recognize the name. He wrote a lot of science fiction.

Now that you know about sidereal time, it might give you some
insight in another section of Gann. We will look at that at a later
time.

One last word. I don't know if Gann intentionally said that the
24 hour turning of the earth was 360 degrees or if it said 361 and
someone doing the re-write changed it or if it was a mistake on
Gann's part or if he wanted you to check it out and find that the
real answer was

361!




                                                                       353
Appendix 2
A COINCIDENCE OF NUMBERS

In Book I "The Cycle of Mars" in the series "The PATTERNS of
Gann" I told how a friend and I had put down the square of 144 on the
weekly soybean chart of the late 1940 and early 1950 period as Gann
had said to do.

I said then that our reaction had been "So what?" since we did
not really see anything that caught our eye. Maybe you have done that
and maybe you found something or maybe your reaction was the same as
ours.

In Book I, I told of how I had laid out the heliocentric planets
over this period with a little better luck.

But I am never satisfied. I keep looking for PATTERNS. I want to
find things that make an exact fit. My friend says I'm too exacting.
He thinks I should be satisfied if things are within a number or two
of being exact.

I have gone back to this chart many times, looking for that
exact fit.

One day I took another approach and found what appears to be an
exact fit. At least there were enough of "coincidences of numbers" to
make me think I had an exact fit.

So take a look at the following workout and see what you think.

Let's put down the three important numbers on the chart.

436-the high in January, 1948
44-the low in December 1932
267-the number of weeks from January, 1948.

In my Book I, I told why the number of weeks might be 266, but
since Gann had 267, let's assume that it was not arbitrary. Let's
assume he had a reason for figuring from that particular date. In
other words, he didn't
just one day sit down and make a commentary on this period. He
picked 267 weeks from the top for some reason.

He said that the square of 144 could be used for any squares we
would like to make.

But I put that square aside and decided to pick another. I
picked the square of 49 or 7x7.

Why? Because the chart we are dealing with is a weekly chart. If
we lay down a square of 49, then it comes out on 49 weeks or 343
(49x7) days. And that would be a cube or 7x7x7.
                                                                        354
You do not need to make up a square of 49 to look for the
coincidences. You don't need a computer. A hand-held calculator would
be helpful, but you can do it with a piece of paper and a pencil.

We don't even have to have the chart. We can just picture it in
our mind. At the top we have 436 and down under it we have 44 and on
out to the right we can mark our 267 weeks.
Now let's use the square of 49 in the same way Gann told us to
use the square of 144.

He subtracted the square of 144 from the top. So let's subtract
49's from the top, one at a time slowly and see if we can see any
"coincidence of numbers."

436-49=387, nothing there.
387-49=338, nothing there.
338-49=289, that's the square of 17, but doesn't seem to mean
much here.
289-49=240, yes, something here. Do you recognize it. Yes, it is
2/3 of a circle but it is also something else. It is the halfway
point between the high of 436 and the low of 44 since 436+44/2=240.
240-49=191, nothing there.
191-49=142, nothing there.
142-49=93, nothing there
93-49=44, certainly something here. We have subtracted 49
several times from the high of 436 and the result is the low.

So let's put down the coincidences we have found so far:

(1) 240-the halfway point.
(2) the low of 44, by continually subtracting 49 from 436.

Gann put the square of 144 at the time of the 436 high and
worked over, but I saw nothing there.

Instead of doing that, I went over to 267 weeks and started
subtracting the square of 49 from that. So let's see if we can find
some other coincidence of numbers.

267-49=218. Yes right off we have found the halfway point of

436

218-49=169, another square, not much here apparently, but...
169-49=120, one-third of a circle, but not much else.
120-49=71, nothing here.
71-49=22, one half of the low of 44.

So let's add those coincidences to the ones we already have:

(1)-240, the half-way point between 44 and 436
(2)-the low of 44, by subtracting 49's
(3)-218, the half-way point of 436
(4)-22, the half-way point of 44
                                                                        355
Just those coincidences alone look pretty good. But I kept
looking for any others I might find using the square of 49.

In his work Gann told about subtracting 360 from 436 and getting
76. We could subtract 76 from 436 and get 360. I decided to "add" 76
to 436 and I got 512!

512? Look familiar?

Divide it by 8 and you get 64. Got it now? 512 is the cube of 8
or 8x8x8.

Well, that's very interesting you say but what does that have to
do with the work at hand.

When we laid down the square of 49 on the weekly chart we were
also counting the cube of 7 since a week has 7 days.
The cube of 7 is 7x7x7 or 343.

If you draw a 45 degree line down from 436 it will cross the
week of 267 at 169. Or to put it another way 436-267 is 169. This
coming out on a square (13x13) always intrigued me.

Remember in Gann's discussion of the hexagon chart he mentioned
that 169 was important for more reasons than one? I always wondered
about that as maybe you have to.

But somewhere along the way I found out one of the reasons.

Let's now subtract the cube of 7 from the cube of 8.

512-343=169!

That's right. The difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of 8
is the same as 436-267.

So there is another coincidence to add to our list.

(1)-240, the half-way point between 44 and 436
(2)-the low of 44, by subtracting 49's
(3)-218, the half-way point of 436
(4)-22, the half-way point of 44
(5)-The 45 degree angle from 436 crosses the week of 267 at 169
which is also the difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of 8.

But I wasn't done looking yet. You know me. Always adding,
subtracting numbers, etc.

I decided to "add" 267 to 436 and I got 703. To you that might
not mean too much but it stuck out like a sore thumb to me. 703 is
the triangle of 37. Look it up and see where it falls on the Square
of Nine chart. It is also a Teleois angle (the book on that is in the
works).

                                                                        356
Now subtract 343 (the cube of 7) from 703 and you get 360!

So let's add those coincidences to our list.

(1)-240, the half-way point between 44 and 436
(2)-the low of 44, by subtracting 49's
(3)-218, the half-way point of 436
(4)-22, the half-way point of 44
(5)-The 45 degree angle from 436 crosses the week of 267 at 169
which is also the difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of 8.
(6)-Adding 267 to 436 is 703, the triangle of 37.
(7)-Subtracting 343 from 703 is 360.

And now for some more.

When I added 76 to 436 and got 512, the cube of 8, I found that
436 was the "arithmetic mean" between 360 and the cube of 8 since 360
plus 76 is 436. (The arithmetic and geometric means were discussed in
Book IV-"On the Square.")

The difference in 343, the cube of 7, and 267 is 76.

The number of weeks from the high of 436 to the low of 202 was
56 weeks. And for those of you who read Book IV you will recognize
that as the geometric mean between the square of 7 and the square of
8 since 7x8 is 56.

In my book "On the Square" I showed where some prices were the
differences in squares. We can see that the difference in 436 and 44
is a difference in several squares of 7. The difference is also equal
to two squares, two squares of 14 since 14x14 is 196 and two times
196 is 392 and 436-44 is 392.

Now let's add those coincidences to our list.

(1)-240, the half-way point between 44 and 436
(2)-the low of 44, by subtracting 49's
(3)-218, the half-way point of 436
(4)-22, the half-way point of 44
(5)-The 45 degree angle from 436 crosses the week of 267 at 169
which is also the difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of 8.
(6)-Adding 267 to 436 is 703, the triangle of 37.
(7)-Subtracting 343 from 703 is 360.
(8)-436 is the arithmetic mean between 360 and the cube of 8.
(9)-76 is the difference in the cube of 7 and 267.
(10) From the high in January, 1948 to the low in February of
1949 is 56 weeks and 56 is the geometric mean between the square of 7
and the square of 8.
(11)436-44 is 392 which equals the sum of two squares of 14.

There are 11 coincidences in numbers we found with our original
three numbers. What does it mean and how can they be used? Frankly I
don't know. But it sure cries for more study!

OK, want some more!
                                                                        357
The difference in the cube of 7 (343) and the cube of 5 (125) is
218! The halfway point from 436.

In other words if we had an overlay with the cubes marked on it,
when we put the cube of 7 (343) on 436, the cube of 5 (125) would
fall on 218.

Where would the end of our overlay fall? Since 436 minus 343 is
93, the end of the overlay would fall on 93.

Is the number 93 significant? Why don't you subtract 44 from it.

You get 49!




Appendix 3
A TV Puzzle

On 10-15-97 on the TV show called "Remember Wenn" on the American
Movie Classics Jason Alexander of the "Seinfeld" show appeared as a
mentalist and did magic tricks on the radio!

He told his audience that he was holding a card in his hand and by
his words the audience would match the card in his hand.

You can play along if you like.

The audience was asked to think of a person they moved the most.
Count the letters in the name and then multiply that times 3. Count
the letters in the name of the person you like the least and multiply
that by 3. Now multiply those to answers. When you get the answer add
up the numbers in the answer until you arrive at a single digit. In
other words if you go over 10, then add the digits again until you
have a single digit.

Are you following the audience? If your answer is 1 to 3, then the
suit is hearts, if it is 4 to 6, then the suit is clubs, if it is 7
to 8, then it is diamonds. If it is 9 then the suit is spades.

The answer is the 9 of spades.

How did the mentalist do it?

It is quite simple and no magic is involved if you read my book, "The
Single Digit Numbering System.".

You will know from that, that the key is in the multiplying. When we
multiplied by 3 and then by 3 again we were simply multiplying by 9
and when "any" number is multiplied by 9 and reduced to a single
digit the answer will always be 9!

                                                                        358
Appendix 4
A SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT NUMBER

Many years ago there was a TV show, the name of which I have
forgotten now. It seems like the name was "Tell the Truth." I have
also forgotten the moderator, though I can picture him in my mind.

The gist of the show was that three people would come on the show and
each would claim to be a certain person. Members of the panel then
through a little questioning would try to guess who was really that
certain person.

After the questioning the moderator asked for the "real" person to
stand up. One of those persons I recall was the person who created
the "Waltons" though I was sure from his voice that the panel would
know who he was because at the end of each Walton segment you could
hear his voice giving a little homespun philosophy.

But this is not a piece on panel shows. I mention the above just to
make a point.

Will the real "perfect number" please stand up!

In my study of Gann I have read a number of books about numbers and
every now and then have run across a passage about a perfect number.

But in all these passages the numbers were usually different. Several
numbers have been put forth as the "perfect number."

So, let's explore some of them.

First, we will start with Gann since this series of books is on the
work of Gann.

He seems to say that the perfect number is 9 since there are nine
digits and they add up to 45. (I covered that in my book, "The Single
Digit Numbering System."

But on page 95 in his book, "The Magic Word" he says the Jewish name
for God, Yod He Vau He, has four syllables and 10 letters and that 10
is one of the perfect numbers.

He might be saying here that 10 is the triangle of 4. It could be
that all triangles of squares are perfect numbers.
(In one of my books I noted that 325 was the triangle of the square
of 25 and Gann said there was a change in cycles here.)

Another number that turns up in other writings as the perfect number
is the number 12.

We can see why that might be considered a perfect number. There are
12 months in a year, 12 signs of the zodiac, 12 tribes of Israel, 12
disciples of Jesus, 12 apostles, 12 inches in a foot, 12 items in a

                                                                        359
dozen, 12 people on a jury and I'm sure you can think of some other
12's.

Then there is the number 7. In some writings it is considered a
"sacred number." There are the 7 days of creation, 7 ancient planets,
7 days in a week.

Some believe it is perfect as you need 3 to get to 10. (This is
explained below).

Others think 10 is the perfect number, even calling it the number for
God or God the one and man the zero or 1 the man and 0 the woman.

On page 53 of the book "Biblical Mathematics" by Evangelist Ed F.
Vallowe he says that 3 is the first perfect number. Others are 7, 10,
and 12, but does not explain why he thinks they are perfect numbers.

On page 200 of Karl Anderson's book, "The Astrology of the Old
Testament," he says, "As this was the original central sign, in which
sundown commenced, of unripe fruits as well as the fall, also the
choleratic months of August and September, of unripe apples, the
really seventh month of the year, and the season or time of perfect
number 7, which is 10, which is IAO..." Here in one breath he is
saying the perfect number is 7 which is 10. Very confusing.

In the Masonic book "Morals and Dogma" on page 628, there is a
discussion of numbers in a question and answer format.

Q: What is the most fortunate number?
A: 7, because it leads us to the decade, the perfect number.

This seems to be the same thing Anderson was saying since Anderson
was a Mason.

That concept of 7 getting to 10 and being perfect had me puzzled for
a long time, but when I was working on some triangular stuff the
PATTERN finally came through to me.

I will not go into what I was working on at this point other than to
say that it was on triangles of the squares. Triangular numbers were
discussed in my Book VI.

What I discovered was that triangles of the squares could be made
through the addition of triangles and squares of the square roots to
make the triangles of squares. I know that is a mouthful but let's
put down some examples to make it clear.

Let's make the triangle of four which is 10 using that method.

Since 2 is the square root of four we will use the triangle and
square of 2.

The triangle of 2 is 3. So let's put that down:

3
                                                                        360
Now we will add the square of 2 which is four and put the answer
under the 3.

3
7 (3+4)

Now add them. You get 10! And 10 is the triangle of 4.

Notice how many "terms" are used above.

Using the same method can you make the triangle of the next square
(9) which is 45? How many terms will you have to use?

Do you need a little help? We start with the triangle of the square
root of 9.

The triangle of 3 is 6 so lets put that down:

6

Now add the square of 3:

6
15 (6+9)

Now add 9 again

6
15 (6+9)
24 (15+9)

Now when we add 6+15+24 we get 45, the triangle of 9.

How many terms did we have? He had three (6, 15, 24)

To make the triangle of 4 which is 10 we had two terms (3, 7)

PATTERN? Yes, we will have as many terms as the square root of the
square whose triangular number we are trying to find.
When we tried to find the triangle of four we needed two terms since
the square root of four is 2. When we tried to find the triangle of 9
we needed three terms since the square root of 9 is 3.

Using the same method can you find the triangle of 49.

Simply put you would need 7 terms. You would find the triangle of 7
which is 28 and you would keep adding 49 until you have 7 terms and
then add up your answer (which is 1225). Get out a piece of paper and
calculator and give it a try.

Another one you might want to try is this. I mentioned in Book VI-
"The Triangular Numbers" that Gann had made few references to
changing cycles. But he did make one to the number 325. (I noted this
above).
                                                                        361
That number which runs on the 180 degree line from the line that
contains the odd squares is a triangular number. It is the triangle
of a square. Rather than tell you what square it is I will leave that
to you as a little project. Figure it out like we did the others
above.

Incidently my findings were confirmed when I went back and re-read
some more of Anderson's material.

I noted in Book X which dealt with the hexagon and cubes that
Anderson made much of the numbers 6 and 9 and I was interested in
them since Gann had a square of 9 and a hexagon chart (6).

In a discussion of 3, 5, and 7 which Masons will tell you are
"important numbers" he says:

"And the 3 and 5 and 7=15, which two figures added are 6=the serpent
number, or 3+5+7+9=24 and these =6..."

My first reaction to these numbers was that he was doing something
similar to something I had already discovered, reducing numbers to
single digits as I explained in Book VIII-"The Single Digit Numbering
System" as he had reduced 15 to 6 and 24 to 6 by adding 9 to 15.

But when I came back to that section it dawned on me that 3, 5, 7 add
to 15. But so does 6 and 9! And 6 is the triangle of 3 and 9 is the
square of 3 and by adding 9 to 15 we get 24 and 6+15+24 is 45, the
triangle of 9, as noted above and 45 is one of Gann's important
numbers.
Now let's move on to what mathematicians refer to as "perfect
numbers." These numbers are the ones whose factors or divisors add up
to the number.

For example the number 6 is a perfect number. It can be divided by 1,
2 and 3 and when we add up 1, 2 and 3 we get 6.

The next perfect number in this system is 28. It's divisors are 1, 2,
4, 7 and 14 and when we add them we get 28.

The next perfect number is 496.

It's divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248. They add to 496.

The next number is high up in the 8,000 range. I noticed right off
that the first 3 were triangular numbers; 6 is the triangle of 3, 28
is the triangle of 7 and 496 is the triangle of 31.

I wondered for a long time if all perfect numbers in this system were
triangular.

Then I found the formula in a book and it confirmed my suspicions of
the numbers being triangular.

The formula for finding these perfect numbers whose divisors add up
                                                                        362
to the number uses the powers of 2. I believe you know what powers
are. 2 to the second power means to multiply 2x2 or 4. 2 to the third
power means to multiply 2x2x2 or 8, etc.

You begin the search for perfect numbers by multiplying the first
power of 2 times the second power of 2 (-1). I do not have a power
symbol here so I will use this sign (^).

2^1 times ((2^2 (-1))
2^1 is 2
2^2 is 4
when we subtract the 1 from 4 we have 3.
So now we have 2 times 3 and the answer is 6.

Now let's do the next one with our first multiplier being 2 to the
power of 2 and the next 2 to the power of 3 from which 1 is
subtracted:

2^2 times ((2^3 (-1))

2^2 is 4 and (2^3 (-1) is 7 and 4 times 7 is 28, our next perfect
number.

Let's do the next one (each time we will use the next power of 2.)

2^3 times ((2^4 (-1))

2^3 is 8 and (2^4 (-1) is 15 and 8 times 15 is 120.

But 120 is not a perfect number. So what happened?

What happened is we did not observe a rule that I didn't tell you
about earlier. If our answer from the numbers in parentheses does not
equal a prime number, it is not used in our calculations. A "prime
number" in case you have forgotten is a number that is divisible only
by itself and the number one. Examples of prime numbers are 7, 11,
13, 19, etc.

The number 15 is not a prime number since it can be divided by 3 and
5 so we have to pass by this calculation. It will not give us a
perfect number calculation. We have to go on to the next one.

2^4 times ((2^5) (-1)). Let's calculate that:

16 times (32-1) or 16 times 31 or 496. This was the next perfect
number after 28 as we saw earlier. And 496 is the triangle of 31.

Can you see now why these perfect numbers are triangular numbers?
Look at the calculations above.

In Book VI-"The Triangular Numbers" I showed that triangular numbers
both natural and unnatural could simply be made by multiplying the
root of the triangle by the next number and dividing by 2.

For example to make the triangle of 4 which is 10, all we need to do
                                                                        363
is multiply 4x5 and divide by 2.

But I also explained that it could be made in another way. Take half
of any of the two numbers, the root or the next number and multiply
it by the remaining number. As an example again of finding the
triangle of 4 which is 10, we could take half of the 4 which is 2 and
multiply times 5 or we could take half of the 5 which is 2.5 and
multiply by 4. The answer will always be the same.

We can see that when we take one power of 2 and multiply it by the
next power of 2 (-1) we are doing the same thing!

We could make the triangle of 31 by multiplying it by 32 and dividing
by 2. Or we could make it by taking half of 31 or 15.5 and
multiplying it times 32 or we could take half of 32 which is 16 and
multiply it by 31.

And that is exactly what we did when we used the 4th power of 2 or 16
and multiplied it by the 5th power of 2 or 32 (-1).

So why don't you now try to find the next perfect number after 496
and see what it is the triangle of. Give it a try before you look at
the answer below:

The first sequence you would try would be:

2^5 time ((2^6 (-1)) and that answer would be:

32 times 63 and that would not be right since 63 is not a prime
number as it can be divided by 9 and 7.

The next you would try would be:

2^6 times ((2^7 (-1) which would be:

64 times 127. Since 127 is prime that would be the next number which
is a power of 2 minus 1 that we could use. The answer is 8128. I told
you earlier that the next perfect number after 496 was in the 8,000
range. And we have found it.

And what is 8128 the triangle of? It is the triangle of 127.
We could multiply 127 times 128 and divide by 2 and get 8128. Or we
could take half of 128 which is 64 and multiply it times 127 which is
exactly what we did in our calculation with the powers of 2 above.

Some experimenting will get you the next perfect number, but I would
suggest you get a computer program that prints out primes to help or
you will be dividing a lot of numbers to see if they are primes!
Believe me, I did that.
No, we have not found the "perfect" number. We have seen what some
call perfect numbers and have seen what mathematicians call perfect
numbers.

Maybe we will have to have a definition of a perfect number in order
to find one.
                                                                        364
Until then that one perfect number is still elusive.




Appendix 5
DECANATES OF THE PLANETS

I had read in a book somewhere a long time ago about the decanates.
Each planet is suppose to have influence over 10 degrees of a sign.
It started with Mars for the first 10 degrees, etc. and ended with
Mars.

Then I saw in "The Astrology of the Old Testament" that these decans
or decanates are also called the "faces" of the planets.

They didn't seem to be in any particular order. But then I discovered
that they are in the same order as the planets are arranged to make
the planetary hours as shown in "The Astrology of the Old Testament."

Whey the decanates start with the planet Mars is something I have not
found out as yet.

I will be checking these decanates with Gann and Bayer stuff to see
if they used them.

(Note: a number of years ago I read in the Encyclopedia Britannica
about Magic Squares. Recently in 1996, I read about them again and
found that Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) constructed squares of the
order 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and associated them with the seven
astrological planets. When I read this years ago I did not pay any
attention to the order of the planets. But this time I noticed that
the order was the same as for the decanates. So the planets and their
magic squares would be Saturn (3), Jupiter (4) Mars (5), Sun (6),
Venus (7), Mercury (8) and the Moon (9). Also note that the Sun is
associated with 6 and the Moon with 9 just as it is in Karl
Anderson's book, "The Astrology of the Old Testament." Might be
coincidence and then again maybe not.


These are the "faces" of the planets or the decanates:

Appendix 6
Another Way to Make Cubes
(Discovered July, 1995)

This is another way to make cubes on a flat surface.

You can draw some boxes. I'm just going to put some numbers in rows.

Of course we can put down:

1 and that would be the cube of 1.

If we put down:


                                                                       366
1, 2
2, 3 and add those we will have the cube of two (or 8) eight. Note
that we are using 2 numbers in each row. Also note that we started
with 1 in the first row and 2 in the second.

Now let's put down a series in which we have three numbers in three
rows:

1, 2, 3
2, 3, 4
3, 4, 5

When we add all the numbers we have the cube of 3 or 27. Note how we
began each row. If we wanted to do a cube of 4 or 64, we would use
four numbers in each row and we would use four rows.

Give it a try!

There is another way to make cubes using triangles. Take the number
of any cube we want to make. Subtract 1 from it and get the triangle
of your answer. Now multiply that triangle by twice the number of the
cube we want to make. Now add the square of the original number and
you will have the cube.

Example: We want to make the cube of 4 which is 4x4x4 or 64. First we
subtract 1 from 4 and get 3. Now find the triangle of 3 which is 6.
Multiply that by 2x4 which is 8. The answer is 48. Now add the square
of 4 which is 16 and 48+16 is 64.

I can never say enough about triangles. You can do so much with them.

Using the formula above why don't you try to make the cube of 5 or
125. I will start you off. The triangle of 4 is 10.




Appendix 7
Triangles and the Arithmetic Mean
(Discovered Jan. 27, 1996)

This is another property of triangles. A number times its triangle
equals the arithmetic mean (half-way point) between the square of the
number and the cube of the number.

Let's use 4 for our number. Its triangle is 10. Multiply 4 times 10,
getting 40. 40 is the arithmetic mean (halfway point) between the
square of 4 (16) and the cube of 4 (64). We can check that by adding
16 to 64 and dividing by 2 to get the halfway point. 16+64=80. Divide
by 2 and get 40 which is 4 times its triangle (4x10).

This also works for other powers of numbers.


                                                                        367
Again let's use the number 4. But this time instead of multiplying 4
times its triangle (10), we will multiply the square of 4 (16) times
the triangle of 4 (10) and we get 10x16=160. We will find that 160 is
the arithmetic mean between 4 to the 3rd power (4x4x4=64) and 4 to
the 4th power (4x4x4x4=256). Now lets add 64 and 256 and get 320. Now
divide by 2 and get 160.

If we wanted to find the arithmetic mean between the 4th and 5th
powers of 4 we would multiply the triangle of 4 (10) times 4 to the
3rd power.

And this would work for any powers you wished to work out.



Appendix 8
More Triangle Stuff

Using even numbers, if we add up to a number (getting a triangle) and
leave out half of the number, you will have a double square of half
of the number.

Example: We will use the even number 12. If we add from 1 through 12
we will get the triangle of 12, which is 78. If we leave out half of
our even number we will leave out the number 6 and that will give us
a total of 72. And 72 is the double square of 6. 36 is the square of
6 and 72 is two times 36 or a double square of 6. Try that with
another even number to check it out.



Appendix 9
DISSECTING A NUMBER

Somewhere in my work I told you that I often ran numbers back and
forth through my calculator looking for PATTERNS. So here I will show
you how I dissected a number (really two numbers) that gave me
trouble for a long time.

At the local library there is a set of books put out by Time-Life
called "Mysteries of the Unknown." You might recall seeing these
advertised on TV in the late 1980's or early 1990's.

One of the volumes in that series was "Ancient Wisdom and Secret
Sects." In had quite a bit of stuff in there on Masonry.

On page 88 was a figure of a man made up of the sun, moon and Masonic
symbols. That figure stood on two stones, cubes if you like. I
noticed that there were numbers on the stones.

One number was 3734. The other was 1754.

                                                                        368
I played with those number off and on for a long time. I checked them
to see if they were squares, triangles, etc. But I got nowhere.

One day I added the two numbers. 3734+1754=5488.

Again I check to see if the total was a square or cube or triangle.
Still nothing.

Then I decided to start dividing 5488 by two. (You might want to get
out your calculator and start doing the same.) I divided by two until
I could not divide by two anymore.

5488 divided by 2=2744
2744 divided by 2=1372
1372 divided by 2=686
686 divided by 2=343

When I had reached an odd number I could no longer divide by 2, I
noticed that my final answer was a cube, the cube of 7 since
7x7x7=343. Interesting.

Since I had divided by 2 four times then 2 to the fourth power or 16
times 343 would equal my starting number 5488.

Since 16 is the square of 4 we could say the square of four times the
cube of seven would equal 5488. Still interesting, but I was looking
for something a little more outstanding.

So I put down my numbers and started rearranging (that's how I do a
lot of my dissecting of numbers, since they can be expressed in a
number of different ways.)

2x2x2x2x7x7x7
4x4x7x7x7 or
4x7x4x7x7 or
28x28x7

Ah hah. Now that looks a little more interesting. Why? Study it a
minute.

What relationship does the number 28 have to 7?
By now you should know that 28 is the triangle of 7. So what we have
here is a number times the square of its triangle, 7(28x28).

But why this particular number times its triangle?

Since there is a moon symbol among the drawings I presume it has to
do with the moon. Admittedly, the number 28 is not exactly a moon
cycle. It takes slightly over 27 days for the moon to come back to
the same point in the sky and it take 29.5 days to make a new moon.

But from what I have read the ancients divided the year 364 days (7
times 52 weeks) into 13 months of 28 days.

On the cover of Gann's little pamphlet "The Magic Word" he has a
                                                                        369
triangle of 7 or 28.

The cubes are also involved here. Remember, if you square any
triangle the answer will include all the cubes up through the root of
the triangle.

Since 28 is the triangle of 7 then 28X28 includes all the cubes up
through the cube of 7 and 7(28x28) will include 7 times all of the
cubes up through 7.

Note that when I took the original number 5488 and divided by two,
etc. until I got to 343 I had found that the square of 4 or 16 times
the cube of 7 or 343 equals 5488.

Also remember that we can take half of 8 (4) and multiply that times
7 to get the triangle of 7.

4x7 is 28

4x4x7x7x7=7X28x28

That works for any odd number.

Example, let's use the number 5 instead of 7.

3x5=15, the triangle of 5.

The square of 3 is 9 and the cube of 5 is 125.

9x125=1125

or we can multiply the square of the triangle of 5 by 5:

5x15x15=1125.

So there you have a sample of how I dissect numbers.



Appendix 10
Some Julian Days

In "The Tunnel Thru the Air" Robert Gordon is born on June 9, 1906
which is Julian Day 2351. The novel ends on Aug. 31, l933 which is
Julian Day 12296. I found no significance in this, but maybe you can.
The difference is 9945 days.




                                                                        370
Appendix 11
Some More on the Cycle of Venus

This is figuring the cycle of Venus. Feb. 15, 1906, Sun and Venus in
conjunction at 25 Aquarius. Julian Day is 2238. Since it takes 584
days for another conjunction we add that and get Julian Day 2822. On
Sept. 15, 1907 the conjunction is at 20 degrees Virgo, which is 8
days before it should be since Julian Day 2822 is Sept. 23. Don't
know why this is.

Sept. 15, 1907-Julian Day is 2814. Add 584 and get JD 3398.
JD 3398 is April 21, l909. But the conjunction comes at 8 degrees
Taurus on April 29, which is eight days later.

So one conjunction came at 576 days and the other at 592, so I guess
when the astro books lists the synodic period at 584, it is an
average.

Appendix 14
The Number Three and Triangles and Squares

You know that the numbers 7, 40 and 77 have a PATTERN. They are made
by adding a triangle of a number to the square of a number. Seven is
made my adding the triangle of 2 (3) to the square of 2 (4). Forty is
made by adding the triangle of 5 (15) to the square of 5 (25).
Seventy-seven is made by adding the triangle of 7 (28) to the square
of 7 (49).

I have discovered that when you multiply those numbers, 7, 40 and 77
or any other that is the sum of a number's triangle and square, you
end up with another triangle.

Let's look at the number 7, which is made up of 3+4. If we multiply 7
by 3 we get 21 which is the triangle of 6. If we multiply 40, which
is made up of 15 and 25, we get 120 which is the triangle of 15. If
we multiply 77 by 3 we get 231 which is the triangle of 21.

How can we determine the triangle we will get?

We simply multiply 3 times the roots of the numbers. The roots of 7
above was the triangle of 2 and the square of 2 so multiply 2 by 3
and get 6 and 21 is the triangle of 6.

The roots of 40 was the triangle of 5 and the square of 5 so simply
multiply 3 times 5 and we get 15 and the triangle of 15 is 120.

The roots of 77 is the triangle of 7 and the square of 7. Multiply 3
times 7 and that is 21 and the triangle of 21 is 231.

Now can you do it with 12.

The triangle of 12 is 78 and the square of 12 is 144. Add them and
get 222. When we multiply by 3 we get 666 and we know that is the
triangle of 36. And 3 times 12 is 36.



Appendix 15
The Number 3 and the Difference in the Cubes .

I showed you that 6 times any triangular number plus 1 will always be
the difference in two successive cubes and the cubs would be the cube
of the root of the triangle and the root of the next triangle.

For instance we could multiply 6 times 28 and add 1 and get 169 which
is the difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of 8 since 28 is the
triangle of 7. Those numbers I have firmly in mind as well as the
triangle of number up to about 25. After that it gets a little hazy
in my mind.

                                                                        372
So I found an easier way of doing it. Say I wanted to find the
difference in the cubes of 144 and 145. First I would have to find
the triangle of 144 and then multiply the answer by 6 and add 1.

But let's look at that easier way.

We know that when we want to find the difference in the cubes of 7
and 8 we would have to find the triangle of 7 by multiplying 7 times
8 and divide by 2 to get 28. Then we would multiply 28 times 6 and
add 1 like we did above to get 169.

We could also say 7x8x6 divided by two and then plus 1. But why not
divide the 6 by 2 and get 3.

Then we could simply say 7x8x3 and then plus 1.

7x8 is 56 and when we multiply by 3 we get 168 and when we add our 1
we get 169 which is the difference in the cube of 7 and the cube of
8.

So back to our difference in the cubes of 144 and 145. We would
simply say 144x145x3 and then add our 1.

That number 3 certainly gets around!



Appendix 16
NUMBERS BOTH TRIANGULAR AND SQUARE

There are some numbers that are both triangular and square. The
number 36 is both the triangle of 8 and the square of 6.

The number 1225 is both the triangle of 49 and the square of 35. I
was trying to figure out what other numbers would be triangular and
square and how I would find those numbers. With a little playing
around I finally figured it out.

Can you do it? Can you tell me the next number that would be both
triangular and square?

We know that to make a triangular number we multiply a number by the
next and divide by 2. We also know that a square times a square is a
square. Can you take it from there?

Let's look at our first number, 36, which is the triangle of 8 and
the square of 6.

We know that to make the triangle of 8 we can multiply 8 times 9 and
divide by 2 and get 36.

But there is something else we could do. We could take half of 8

                                                                       373
which is 4 and multiply by 9 and get 36.

Do you have it now?

When we divided by 8 and got 4 we got a square (2x2) and when we
multiplied by 9 (3x3) we got 36.

Got it now?

Think of 8 as a double square and when we divide by two we get a
square.

So what we need are two successive numbers in which one is a square
(in this case 9) and the number before or after it is a double square
(in this case 8).

The 1225 above is both triangular and square. It is the triangle of
49 and the square of 35. To make the triangle of 49 we would multiply
by 50 and divided by 2. We see that 50 is a double square (the double
of 25 which is 5x5) and we get the square of 35 because 7x7x5x5 is
35x35.

The next number that would be both triangular and square I figured in
my head one night. I was looking for a square that had a double
square before it or after it.

We have already done the square of 7 so let's work up from there. I
will put down some squares and we will look at the number next to it
both before and after to see if it is a double square. We can divide
those numbers by 2 and take the square root to see if we have the
square of a natural number.

8x8=64 (63, 64, 65). No double square
9x9=81 (80, 81, 82). No double square
10x10=100 (99, 100, 101). No double square
11x11=121 (120,121,122). No double square
12x12=144 (143, 144, 145). No double square
13x13=169 (168, 169, 170). No double square
14x14=196 (195, 196, 197). No double square
15x15=225 (224, 225, 226). No double square
16x16=256 (255, 256, 257). No double square
17x17=289 (288, 289, 290). We have a double square!

Do you see it?

Yes from all of your Gann reading you should know that 288 is two
squares of 144.

So if we found the triangle of 288 we would have a triangular number
which is also a square.

So multiply 144 times 279 and we would have 12x17x12x17 and the
answer will be the square of 204 and the triangle of 288.



                                                                        374
The numbers 12 and 17 are intriguing since if we had a square of 12,
its diagonal would almost be 17.



Appendix 17
FINDING THE TRIANGLE OF DOUBLE OF A NUMBER

(Discovered Dec. 24, 1998)

When reading "Square of the Magi," the author had 28 plus 36 plus 36 plus
36. Couldn't figure out why he didn't stop at just adding 28 and 36
to arrive at square of 8. But then it dawned on me. He carried it out
until he had the triangle of 16 which is 2x8.

Thought I had something new. But then I saw that when 28 is added to
36 we get the square of 8 and I knew that a square plus two triangles
of its root equals the triangle of a number that is twice as big.

Example: Thd square of 4 plus 10 plus 10 equals 36 which is triangle
of 8. We could say triangle of 4 plus square of 4 plus triangle of 4.

But we can find some interesting numbers if we keep on adding
triangles.

Starting with 15 (the triangle of 5) and adding 21 (triangle of 6) we
get

15
36 (the square of 6)
57
78 (the triangle of 12 naturally)
99
120
141
162
183
204
225 (the square of 15)
246
267 (where Gann stopped in weeks on the bean chart)
288 (double square of 144)
309
330
351
372
393
414
435 (just one cent short of his high on beans)

When I saw the 15 on top of this list and the 225 (the square of 15)
down the list I thought I saw a germ of a PATTERN.


                                                                            375
I saw that when I subtracted 15 from 225 and got 210 and divided it
by 21 I got 10 and that is the triangle of 4. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. But
after I gave it a little thought I found that we had already
discovered that.

Remember when we looked at some of the properties of triangles we
found that if we took three successive triangular numbers like 10,
15, 21, we could multiply the two end terms and add the middle term
and would have the square of the middle term. So that is what was
happening above. I took 15 and after adding 21 for a total of 10
times I came to the square of 15.

Let's extend our list and see what else we can find.

15
36 (the square of 6)
57
78 (the triangle of 12 naturally)
99
120
141
162
183
204
225 (the square of 15)
246
267 (where Gann stopped in weeks on the bean chart)
288 (double square of 144)
309
330
351
372
393
414
435 (just one cent short of his high on beans)
456
477
498
519
540
561
582
603
624
645
666 the triangle of 36 (the square of 6)

Note that we started by adding 15 and 21 and got the square of 6 or
36 and here we have arrived at 666 which is the triangle of 36.

Note that when we subtract 36 from 666 we get 330 and when we divide
330 by 21 we get 30. PATTERN?

Yes, we see that we started with the triangle of 5 (15) and the
triangle of 6 (21) and we know that 5x6 is 30.
                                                                        376
We saw earlier how triangles of squares can be made, but now we have
a new one.

For the triangle of the square of 7 (49) which is 1225 we could say
6x7=42 and 42 times 28 is 1176. Add 49 and we get 1225. Why 6x7 or
42. Remember that the triangle of 6 and the triangle of 7 when added
equals the square of 7. So taking the square of 7 (49) and adding 42
times the triangle of 7 (28) gives us 1225, the triangle of the
square of 7.



Appendix 18
THE CUBES AND THE TRIANGLE OF THE SQUARE

We saw earlier that the cubes are contained in the squares of the
triangle. For instance if we take the triangle of 7 which is 28 and
square 28 the answer will include all the cubes up through the cube
of 7.

The cube is also connected to the triangle of the square. I
discovered this in one of my usual PATTERN searches.

Gann had talked about a change in cycles when you come to 325. I knew
that 325 was the triangle of a square, the triangle of 25 which is
the square of 5.

I was curious about how the cube of 5 might be involved with 325, so
I subtracted 125 from 325 and got 200. 200 is a double square, two
times 10x10. And I knew that 10 was the triangle of 4 and 4 is one
unit less than 5.

Looks like there is a PATTERN there so let's check it out. If we are
right then:

Double square of triangle of 3 plus cube of 4 will equal 136 which is
the triangle of the square of 4.

The triangle of 3 is 6. The square of 6 is 36 and the double square
of 6 is 72.

The cube of 4 is 64 and 64 plus 72 is 136.

And 136 is the triangle of the square of 4 which is 16.

PATTERN made!

I still don't know what Gann meant by the change of cycles at 325,
but I still believe it has to do with the fact that it is a triangle
of a square.



                                                                        377
