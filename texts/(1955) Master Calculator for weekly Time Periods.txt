MASTER CALCULATOR FOR WEEKLY TIME PERIODS
70 DETERIINE TEE TREND OF STOCKS AND COMMODITIES

dy-W. D. GAME

This Master Calculator shows Weekly Time Periods of 7 days each or a totel of
52 weeks in one year. This represents S64 calender days, therefore at the end
of each year there is a gain of one day and at the end of 7 years a gein of

7 days, the time period coming out one week before the dete of the importent
high end low prices. You must also add one day for each leep year. Suppose
you want to get the time period for 15 years, you mltiply S65 by 15, add the
number of leep years and then divide the total deys by 7 to get the weekly
periods of 7 deys each in order to use the Calculator. ‘See Tables for Price
and Time Periods.)

The total souare of 52 is 2704, which we can use to measure weeks, days, months,
yeers or hours. In using days, it would, of course, require 2704 deys to pass
thru the square of 52. This would give 586 weeks and 2 deys_or approximately

7 years and 5 months, very close to the important cycle of 1% years, which is
90 months.

if we use hours to belance or square 2704, we get 112-2/3 days by dividing 2704
by 24, the total number of hours in @ day during vhich time the earth makes one
complete revolution on its axis.

The Squere of 52, which is composed of 7-dey periods, is one of the most import-
ant for measuring Price end Time. ‘The number 7 is referred to in the Bible
more times than any other number, except the nunter 5. Both of these numbers
ere very important to use in connection with price and time chenges.

You start time periods from the actual dates of importent high ond importent
low prices and not fron the first day of each month or the first dey of each
year.

The Celculetor is 104 weeks wide, which equals 2 years. The time periods

run ecross the bottom of the Celculator from left to right to 104, which com-
pletes 2 years, and to 208, which completes 4 yeers, At the top of the Calcula-
tor, ruoning across to the left, the time periods yun to 312 which ends 6 yeers,
and to 416, which ends 8 years, and to 520, which completes a 10-year cycle.

DIVISIONS OF TIE PERIODS

The year is divided by 1/8, which equals 63 weeks

THIND AND FOURTH DIMENSIONS
OF TIME AND PRICE

We kaow of three dimensions--height, width and length--but there is & fourth
dimension o> element in market movenents. We prove the fourth dimension with
the Master Calcuiator or Squere of 52 in Time Periods of 7 days each for 7
weeks or more and the same price relation, 7x 52 equals 364 or 7 years,

THE CIRCLE, TRIANGLE AND SQURE

The circle of 360° and the nine digits ere the basis of 21] mathematical cal-
culations. The Square and the Triangle form within the circle but there is an
inner circle and an inner square, as well as ean outer square and én outer cir-
ele which prove the fourth dimension in working out merket movements.

PRICE
The most important points to consider ere:

1. Lowest price.
2. Highest price.
3. The Ve point, mean or averege betreen the extreme high and the extreme low.
We ges the fourth Gimensicn, as shown on the Kaster Calculator, by érewing 45°
angles from the 1/2 poist or grevity center, which is the most important for
price resistance.
4. Volume of Sales. This is the power which drives the market up or down but
remenber that TIME is the most essential element end vhen Time is cozmpleted,
the volune of sales stsrts to move the merket up or down.

THE

Time is divided into secticns or cycles by which we determine the chenge in
trend.

1. Deily high end low prices

2. Weekly high and low prices

3. Monthly nigh and low prices

4. Yearly high and low prices

The Weekly and the Yearly Time Periods are nost importent for trend indications
and for chenges in tread.

The day is divided into hours, minutes and seconds. The 4 divisions of the day
are: Sunrise, Hoon, Sunset snd Midnight. Of these the most important are:
Noon, wren the Sun is strsight overhead or on s 90° angle, end Hi¢night, the
opposite point or 180° from Noon and 20° from Sunset.

Beceuse we are using 7-cay Time Periods with the Celcwlator, 1/2 of 7 days or
3} days is impertant to watch for change in trend. Always watch the 3rd and
4th €ay from eny important high or low level for a miner chenge in trend which
leter mey become a mejor chengs.
