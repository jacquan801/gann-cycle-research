SPECULATION A PROFITABLE PROFESSION

4 Course of Instructions With Rules for Trading in Stocks

FOREWORD

Be ready for opportunities. Knowledge more important than
capital, To succeed in any business you must be prepared, and in
preparing for a speculative or investment business you must look
up the greatest advance or the greatest decline a stock has ever
had and the greetest time period from the high or low. Most
profits are made in active fast moving markets, Example s;
Stocks 1924-1929- eptember 29th to November 15th, 1929; Novem-
ber 13, 1929 to April 17, 1930.

FAST ADVANCES

You will find these from June 1949 to June 1950; June 13,
1950 to July 14, 1950 this was a fast decline.
1952 and 1953 - September 1953 to April 1954, fast advance.

SLOW TRADING MARKET

wou should keep out of slow trading markets or watch until
you get a definite indication of a change in trend. There was &
Slow trading market from November 1946 to November 1949, that
is the range in most stocks was narrow because. the market was
going through a period of consolidation or accumulation and
getting ready for the big bull market which followed later.

CROSS CURRENTS

fou must learn to know that some stocks Sometimes are de-
glining while others are advancing, pnd that there are cross
gurrents, and you must know about these. Example: 1952 to 1954
Studebaker, Chrysler, Gelanese declined while Vanadium, Steel,
DuPont and Aircraft stocks advanced. Only by a study of the
individual stocks and the different groups can you determine what
stock is supposed to decline at the time whon another stock is
going to ddvance.

HOW TO SELECT THE GROUP oF sTOOKS WHICH WILL LEAD AN ADFANCE oR
A DECLINE

During 1953 - 1954 the Aircrafts were big leaders. You
Gan see from the chart and the Group of the averages on Aircrafte
where they broke into now high levels. Example: Douglass Air-
oraft, Boeing Aircraft,United, Glenn Martin and Lockheed all
indicated that they were in a position to advance when the av-
erage price or average value of the group of stocks indicated a

atrong position. Without a knowledge of these things you
could not make  suocasa.

LOW PRICE STOCKS DIS APPOINTING

A study °* rast history proves that buying low prica
stocks often ties up capital for a long period of time. You
Wait, and if you do not lose money you lose your patienos and
whon: your patience is exhausted in advance of the start you
get out. Many low price stocks haye held in a narrow trading
for 5, 10 years or more before they started to advance or to
decline and some, after remaining in a narrow trading renge
for a long périod of time, declined to new low levela. The
best way to make money is to teke higher price stocks and buy
then efter they have broken into new high ground and show
aBotivity as outlined under the rules below.

NEW INDUSTRIES AND GROWTH STOCKS

Seloot stocks to buy in new industries but maka oareful
study of their proapeots and make up charts _on stooks that you |
fitend to trade in, and if they are part of a.group that you :
om get a record of, study this group and then pick the indj-
vidual stook to buy that shows indioation of leading the group.

STOCKS OF THE FUTURE

When considering what stocks to buy in qhe future, you
must make up charts and study the companies which are produoing
Uranium and are developing Atomic Energy machinery for commeroial
purposes. Among this group of stocks are Babcook & Wiloox Co.,
Bendix Aviation Corp., Dow Chemical Co., DuPont , General
Dynamios Corp., General Blectric (which is one of the largest
in the businass and hes crdersa from the U. S. Government as
well as a.few cofmercial concerns), Newport News Shipbuilding,
Phillips Petroleum, Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., Union
Carbide and Carbon Corp., Vanadium Corp. of America and
Westinghouse Eleotric Corp.

fmong the very best of these stooks for the future we
consider Vanadium, Molybedeum, General Dynamics Corp., whioh
has now consolidated with Consolidated Vultee.

dmong the low pricod stocka with future possibilities of
enhacement in value due to Uranium deposits is New Park Mining
Listed on the American Exchange. Fairchilds Engine md Airoraft
Corp. also has possibilities of becoming a future leader.

You must, of course, buy any of these stocks at the time !
the total value of all stooks on tho N. ¥. Stook Exchange show

De

up~trend and buy the bost of the individual stocks when the
individual groups show up-trend, selecting the one you buy thé
is in the strongest vosi tion.

You would not. buy any of these higher priced stocks at
the present time because the total value of all stocks on the
N. ¥. Stock Exchange is at the highest levels in history and
because the trend of stccks has been up in a general way since
1932 and the last extreme. low was. April 1942 and the present
swing in the bull market started in June, 1949. Therefore
it is natural to expect a decline in stocks during the last
half of 1954 and you must bo cautious on the buying side.

HOW TO MAKE SPECULATION A PROFITABLE PROFESSION

Speculation or investment is the best business in the
world if you make a tusiness of it. But in order to make a
success of it you must study and bé prepared and not guess,
follow inside information cr depend on hope or fear. If you
do you will fail. Your success depends on knowing the right
kind of rules and following them.

CUNDAMENT AL RULES-

Keep this well in mind. For_stooks to show up-trend
and continue to advance they must make higher bottoms and higher
tops. When the trend is down they must make lower tops and
Lower bottoms end continue on down to lower loveis, But re-
member, prices can move in’a narrow trading range for weeks or
months or even years and not make a new high or a new low. But
after a long period of time when the stocks break into new Lows
they indicate lower prices and after a long period of time vhen
they advance above old highs or old tops they are in a stronger
position and indicate higher prices. This is the reason why
you must have a chart a long way back in order to see just
what position the stock is in and at what stage it is between
extreme high and extreme low. :

THE KIND OF CHARTS TO KEEP UP

Rembmber the old Chinese proverb, "One good picture is
worth 10,000 words". You should make up charts and study the
picture of a stock before you make a trade. You should have a
weekly high and low chart, a monthly high- and low chart, and a
yearly high and low chart. A yearly high and low chart should
run back 5, 10 or 20 years, if you can get records thet far.
Monthly high end low chart should run back for at least 10 years
and the weekly high and low chart should run back for 2 or 3
years. When stocks are very active you should have a daily
high end low chart. This need not go back more than a fev
months, especially start the daily chart after the stook broalcs
Tnto great activity.

FOLLOW THI MAIN REND

You will always make money by following the main trend
of stocks up or down, Romember that stooks are never too high
to buy as long as the trend is up and they are never too low to
sell as long as the trend is down. Hever sell short just be-~
cause the stock is high or because you think it 1s too high.
Never sell out and take profits just beoause the price is high.
Buy and sell sooording to definite rules and not on hope, fear
orm-guesswork. Never buy_a stock just begause tho stock is low.
There is usually a good reason why it is low end it osn go lower.

RULES FOR BUYING AND SELLING

The first thing to remember before you start to apply
any rules is that you must always use a STOP LOSS order to
proteot your capital. When making a trade remember that you
oan be wrong or that the market may change its trend and the
STOP LOSS order will proteot you and limit your loss. A small
dess or several small losses can easily be made baok with one
Large profit but when you let large losses run against you
itis hard to make them back.

PROVE ALL THINGS AND HOLD FAST 10 THAT WHICH IS GOOD

The Bible tells us this and it is well worth remembering.
Many people believe that it is wrong to buy at new high levels
or to sell at new low levels but, it’ is.most profitable and you
must prove this to yourself because when you do buy at, now high
Levels or Bell at new low levels you are ‘going with the trend
of the market md y your chences for mac ing profits are muoh
better than any guesswork or buying or selling on hope or fear.

PROLONGED ADVANCES

ffter stocks nave had a prolonged advance and wind up
with_o fast, active, runaway market in most cases thoy coma
“gown very quiokly and much faster or in a shorter period of
time than when they go up. That is why you must keep up some
daily charts at the end of a fast move and keep up the weekly
charts to determine the first ohange in trend and be able to
go with it.

SHARP DECLINE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

This usually follows a rapid advance and the first sharp
declings which may last from one month to as much as seven weeks
usually corrects an overbought position and leaves the market in.
position for a secondary advance.

Whon_ you aro able to catch extremes at_the end of any.
great time cycle you can make a large amount of money in one
year's time trading in fast active markets. It meékes no
difference whether you catch the extreme low or the extreme
high; the opportunitiss are great for making money providing
you select the stocks that will lead.

LARGE PROFITS ON SMALL RISKS

You oan make large profits on small risks provided you
use_a STOP LOSS order snd apply all the rules, then wait for a.
definite indication of a change in trend up or dowm before you
make a trade. :

FIXED IDEAS AND FIXED PRICES

Never get a fixed idea of just how high any price is
going to go or just how low. they are going. Never buy or sell
on a price that you fix beoause you may be trading on hope or
foar and not following the trend of the market md applying
rules vhich will determine when the trend is changing.

HOW TO PROTECT PROFITS

After you have accumulated profits it is just as impor-
tant to proteot them with STOP LOSS orders as it is to protect
your original capital because once you have, made profits it is
your capital and STOP LOSS orders must be used to protect it.
The most dangerous thing that you can do is to let a trade
start going azainst you. You lose baok your profite. <A STOP
LOSS order will protect the profits and you can always get in
again when you are out with capital. Remember when you are
out of the market, the only thing you can lose or iniss is an

opportunity.

My 52 yeors' experience has taught me that thousands of
people have gone broke trying to hold on until the trend turned.
Avold getting out of the market tao soon after move starts when
you have a small profit. This can be a groat-mistake. Get out
of the market quickly as soon as you see that you have made a
mistake. If you place a STOP LOSS order this will put you out
of the market automatically.

TOO LATE OR TOO SOON

You can lose money or miss opportunity by getting into
the market too soon or getting out too Tate, That is, nob
woiting until a definite change in trend is indicated or
falling to act in time when you see a definite change in trend,
Wait until you have a well defined indication that the trend

has changed, then buy or gall. Follow all the rules in my book
"a5 YEARS IN WALL STREET", There ore many rules in my book
"a5 YEARS IN WALL STREET" which are not in this course of in-
struction and by using-all the rules you will moke a greater
BUCC OES.

HOPE AND FEAR

I repeat this because I have seen so many people go broke
trading om hope or feare You will never succeed buying or solling
when you hope the market is going up or down. You will never
Succeed by making a trade bacalse you fear the market is going
up or down, Hope will ruin you because it is nothing more than
wishful thinking and provides no basis for action, Fear will
often save you if you act quiokly when you-see that ‘you are
wrong. "fhe fear of the market is the boginning of wisdom’.
Knowledge whioh you can only obtain by deep study will help
you to make a success. The mote you study past records the
suror you are to be able to detect the trend of the future.

MAKE THE MARKET MOVE YOUR WAY

You must learn to realize thet you oannot make the mar-
ket go your way, you must go the market's way and must follow
the trend. Many successful business men who are accustomed to
giving orders to others and have them oarried out will often,
when they get into the market, especially for the first time,
expeot the market to follow their orders or move their way.
They must learn that they cannot make the market trend go their
way. They: must follow the market troid as 1b indicated by fixed
rules and proteot their capital and profits by the use of STOP
LOSS orders. There is no harm in making a few mistekes and 4 |
few small losses because ‘small losses are the expense of a
successful speculator.

NEVER AVERAGE A LOSS

This is the surést way to lose all or a great part of your
capital. If you have bought a atock aml it shows you a loss, the
trend is moving against you, and it is very foolish to buy more,
whioh will only ihorease your losses. The tims to inorease
buying is when the market is moving in your favor, and you have
a profit. If you intend to make apeoulation a profiteble pro-
fession, you must learn all the rules and apply all of them to
determine the trend. Professional men, such as lawyers, dootors,
acoountantsa and engineere spend years in training and a le ge
emount of money to learn how to succeed in their chosen p? ofaa-
sion, You must spond timo ond monoy to learn tho profession
and, become a successful epeoulator or investor.

RULES FOR TRADDUG IN STOCKS

RULE 1. Buy at new high prices or old top levels.

RULE 2. Buy when prices advance above old low price levels. |

RULE 8, Sel) when prioss decline below old top levels or high
prices.

RULE 4. Sell at now low price levels. As a general rule it is
safer to wait until prices advance at least 1 to 2 points above
high levels and still more important to wait until they close
above these levels before buying and at the samo time it is
safer to wait until prices deoline 1 to 2 points below old
levels’ and still safer to wait until they close below these

old levels before making a tradé.

RULE 5, Closing Prioes. Wait to buy or sell until prices
olose above old highs or below old lows on the daily or weekly
oharte when markets are very active and moving fast; it is
important to use the daily high and low chart and the closing
price above highs or below lows. Prices may advance rapidly
during the day but when it comes to closing time they may

run off several points and olose lower than the previous day,
and at the same time when there is a sharp decline, pricos may
go below the low of the previous day but when they close they
close near the high levels; therefore, it is the closing price
‘that is always important to keep up on the auily, weacly or
monthly high or low charts, The longer the time period in days,
weeks, months or years when prices exceed old highs or break old
lows, the greater the importance of the change in trend and the
move up or dow, Remember the general rule, when ‘prices ad-
vance to new high levels they generally react back to the old
tops which is a safe place to buy.and when they decline below
old lows, as a rule they rally back to the old lows which is a
safe place to sell. Always, of course, protect with STOP LOSS

orders.

RULE 6. STOP LOSS ORDERS. Your capital and your profits must be
protected at all times with STOP LOSS orders which must he
placed when yrou make the trade and not later.

RULE 7. mount of capital required. It is very important to
know exactly how much of your capital you can risk on any one
trade and never lose all of your capital. When you make a trade
you should never risk more than 10% of the capital you have to
trade with, and if you have one or two losses, reduce your units
of trading. ~~

THE BEST BUYING POINT. This point is when prices decline to 50%
of the highest price at which a stock has ever sold; the next
strongest and best buying price is 50% between the extreme low
and the extreme high (See example on Chrysler Motors).

&.

SELLING LEVEL: When prices advance after they havo been con-
siderably below the 50% point and advance for the FIRST TIME,
it is a selling level and 4 price to sell short, protected
with STOP LOSS orders 3 points above the 50% level, The first
time a stock reaches these levels, if the indications on the
daily chart and the weekly chart show it is making tops, you
should sell out long stocks and sell short.

The next important selling level is 50% between the ex-
treme low and the extreme high.

CHRYSLER MOTORS: Example of 50% price.

1946, February high 1414, divide by two and get 50% of
the highest selling price. This gives 70 3/4. After Chrysler
was split up and sold ex-stock dividend in 1947, it declined to
44 in June 1949; from this level, which was a buying point, the
trend started up.

1953, January high 98%; we always expect selling just
under 100 and Chrysler made top at this level. We figure the
range being 44 and 98% which gives a 50% price at 71d.

1953, June Chrysler low 70, just below the 50% price.
It rallied to 73 in August which was a very feeble rally and
closed at 71 indicating lower and was a short sale.

1932, Chrysler extreme low 95 per share; 1953 high 1414,
50% of these extremes is 7325 when Chrysler can advance and
close above 73$ it will indicate higher prices. .

1954, February Chrysler declined to 57 and has shown very
little rallying power. At the time of this writing the main
trond 4s down and when it closes below 57 it vill indicate
lower. The next price to watch is the old low of 44 made in
June 1949.

Look up the extremes highs and lows ond figure all other
stocks in the same way to get buying and selling points and re-
sistance levels.

When you start trading be sure that you know all of the
rules ond that you follow them, and be sure that you place a
STOP LOSS order.

WHERE TO PLACE STOP LOSS ORDERS: You must place STOP.LOSS orders

below the lows of swings and not just below the lows on the -
daily chart. STOPS must be above old tops or below old bottoms
on 8 & weekly or- “monthly < chart.

o

STOP LOSS orders should be placed below closing prices
on the daily, weekly or monthly chart. They are much safer
under closing prices and less likely to be caught, because you
are trading with the trend. STOP LOSS orders placed above clos
ing prices on the daily or weekly chart are caught a smaller
number of times than if you place them below the daily bottoms
or daily tops.

The swings or reversals in the market are the prices to
place STOP LOSS orders below the price of the swing or above the
price of the swing, It is of great importance to know where to
piace SLOP LOSS orders properly.

For stocks selling around $10 a STOP LOSS order is us-
ually safe if you place it 1-point below closing price.

‘For stocks Selling between 20 and 30, STOPS should de
placed 2-points below bottoms ov below closing prices

Stocks selling between 90 and 150; in this range of
prices SROPS should be 3-points under the lows or closing prices,
and 5-points above. the high*oy ‘low~ciosing .priocas,

When stocks are very active and selling at these extreme
high prices, you must depend upon the daily high and Low chart to
give you the first indication of a change in trend which will
later be confirmed on the weekly high and low charts.

“hen stocks are selling at extreme high levels, follow
all the rules in my book, “45 YEARS IN WALL STREET", and if
you have taken my Master Foreoasting Course apply the rules on
Great Time Cycles as well as the minor time periods,

Remember you can never have too much knowledge. Continue
“to study and learn more for the knowledge can always be turned
into prcfits later, :

WHAT TO DO BEFORE YOU MAKE A TRADE. Check all records
of prices, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly and- note all time
periods. Note when the prices ure neat some old high levels or
nearsome old low levels of recent weeks or years, Then calculate
just what your risk will be before you make the-trade and after
you make it, place the STOP LOSS order for your protection in
case you sre wrong,

WEEKLY HIGH AND Loi CHART: The weekly high and low chart is a
very important trend indicator. When prices get above a ser
of weekly highs or lows, or decline below a series of weekl
lows, “it is of greater importance and indicates
in trend which may lust for many weeks,

MONTHLY HIGHS AND LOWS: When prices advance above or, decline be-
low prices which have occurred for many wonths past, it means a
greater change in trend which can lest for several months.

YEARLY HIGHS aND LOWS: ‘When prices advance above or decline be-
low the prices made several years in the past, it is nearly al-
ways a sure sign of big moves which will last for a long period
of time or at. Teast have a greater advance or decline in a
short period of timé, and when these: old highs are crossed, or
‘Lowa broken, alwaya watch for a reaotion to come back to around
the old highs or slightly lower and after they are broken, ‘ex-.
pect the rally to advance back to.dround the ‘old highs or
slightly below. © oF ° :

Study the yearly highs and lows and you will see the
proof. Reinembex the greater thé time period when it is ex-
oeeded, the greater the move up or ‘down.

RULES FOR STOCKS:

A, How much decline ‘to expect in a pull. market and how
much rally to expect in a bear market.

Afcer a bull market gets under way and stocks are mov-
ing up fast, the reactions are likely to be quick and sharp but
they will never last more than 3 to 4 weeks as a general rule
and then the upward trend will be resimed, so you can, always’
figure that stocks: area buy on a reaotion of about 2 month in
a bull market. In a bear market after the gmain trend has been
established dovnward, the rallies wiil run. three weeka bo
four weeks and seldom ever more than one month,. but in some
oases after sharp, severe deslines in a short: periodof time
rallies will last as much. as 2 months - just.the same there
is a possibility of a reaction in a bull market running 2 months
after extremes. By keeping theserules ‘in mind you will have
a guide as to when the main trend is changing up or down.

B, How to make tlie. most money in the shortest period
of time.

People want to get rich quick, that is:.why they lose their
money because they try to get rich quick without first pre-
paring themselves for getting ready or having the knowledge
to know how md-‘when to make the most money in the shortest
period: of time. I om going to prove to you, by examples, and
you oan also prove to yourself, when you can moke the most money
in the shortest period of time. Do not try to lead the market
or make the market. Follow the big men with big money and
you will make’ big money. Buy when the big market makers are- ready
for prices to move up fast and you will make the most money in
& short period of timo, Sell whon tho big market money makera
have distributed stocks ond are ready for them to go down md
there is indication of a definite trend doynward. Then sell

short and you will make the most money in the shortest per‘od
of time.

It requires time for a market to get ready, time for
stooks to be absorbed or accumulated but once we have passed
from weak into strong hands, then they move up fast bedense
the offerings are smaller and the big people just have to let
the market roll and do a little buying and it goes up easy.

It also requires a long period of time to sell out
stocks or distribute them once they have reached the high
levels and let the stocks pass from strong ‘hands into weal
nanda- When this period is over and the market is ready, then
3* declines fast and if you trade this way and wait until there
42 a definite indication that the trend has changed, you really
coo meke the most money in the shortest period of time.

Below I am giving you some examples to prove that
these rules work and that the market goes up the fastest
after a long period of time ond iow fastest in the last
atages after a long period of declining market.

BORING AIRCRAPY 1949, June low Liz: 1950, May high 313, UF:
14 points ‘in 1] months.

1950, September. Buy at 37 in new highs; 1951, Febru-
ary high 56, up 19 points in 5 months. This is making the most
profits in the quickest and shortest period of time..

1954, February. Buy at 57 at new highs. 1954, Aprid
Sell ‘at 83, UP 26 points in 2 months. It takes nerve to buy
at aew highs but that is what big people do and you are only
following them when you buy at new high levels and then’ you
make the mast money in the shortest period of time.

DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT: 1951, June low 434; October 1951 high 66%,
UP 23 points in 4 months.

GLENN L. MARTIN: 1949, June low 7; 1952 high 22; 1952, July low 9.
Therefore, the low of 9 in July 1952 was a higher bottom, a
support and buying level. The trend was up_until February

1953. high 184. Note last previous high 194 in September 1951;
from this lower top the trend started down.

1953, June to September low 12 at the old tops of April
sayzember 1952, remaining for four months in a range of* 2:
points snd indicated good support and a buying level and you
should ouy,

February crossed led, the high of February 1953.
Here you would follow the vule and buy at new high levels.

1954, high is 25% on a volume of $84 thousand shares for the
woek ending April 3, 1954. The large volume indioated public
buying at high levels snd short covering and a reaction was due.

Note April 1948 high 22k and January 1951 high 22;
the price of 254 was $4 points above these old high levels
indicating a possibility of higher prices.

Later, The reaction during the week ending May 8
brought prices down to 21 3/4 which was at the old high levels
of 1948-1961 md a rally started up from 21 3/4.

UNITED AIRCRAFT: 195], May high 413; 1961, July low 26; 1951,
Ootober high 33; 1951, December low 284; 1952, February high
333, same high as Ootober 1951 and a selling level.

1952, May low 27%, about the same low as December 1951
and higher than June 1951 low.

1952, September orossed 33, the old high, Buy at new highs.

1953, April high 404, just below 41%, the high of May
1951, moking this a selling level.

1953, April and May low 32 to 3 4, just below the old
tops of 33, a buying level, then the advance was resumed.

1953, October prices crossed 41%, thezhigh of May 1951.
Follow the rule and buy at new high levels as the trend was up
and continued up-with very small reactiona.

1954, April high S94, the highest price aince September
1930 when the last high was 65 and the two previous highs were
64; therefore, 64-65 is the next resistance level to watch for
tops. The price is now up more than 100% from May 1952 and a
natural reaction often comes when stocks have advanced 100%.

fnalyze any other Aircraft stock in the same way in
vhich we have analyzed these stocks and in fact any other stock
of any other group. First you should keep a chart of the total
value of the group as published by the New York Stock Exchange
Statistical Bureau and then keep up weekly, monthly and yearly
highs and lows on the different individual stocks so that you
will have a record far enough back that you will know where
the important tops and bottoms are and know when change. in
trend comes by prices advancing above old highe or ‘breaking
below old lows. You cannot have too much information or too many
records when you are going to risk your cepital. You must be
fully prepared and ready, then you can take advantage of op-
portunities when they come based on scientific mathematical de-
dustions and not hope, fear or guesswork.
DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT: 1953, Octobor buy at now high 74. 1954, April
seil at 133, UP 59 pointe in 6 months. This was making the most
money in a short period of time efter you bought it at very high
levels, Why? Because the big people had absorbed all the stock
offered below and offerings were very small, so when buyers come
in the market advanced rapidly and profits to the. buyers who
bought at high levels made profits fast in a short period of time.

LOCKHEED AIRCRAFT: 1943, November low 124; 1944, August high 24,
114 points profit in 21 months.

1945, August low 25; 1946, May high 45+, up 21% pointa
in 5 months. Here you were making nearly as much in 5 months as
- you mede in 21 months previously.

1961, July low 1735 1953, March 263, UP 9 points in @
montha., A small profit in a long period of time.

1954, March. Buy at’A7 at a now high, 1.054, Aprid high
59 3/4. UP 12°3/4-points in.1 month, Here you would make the most
profits in the shortest: period of.. time after buying at a new high
level. Why was this move 60, fast? ‘Because after a long period
of time the insiders or people who were in the know had bought
ell the Vanadium that wes offered and when it all was absorbed and
bidding started to come into the market, it advaenoed very ra-
pidly. In this way, when you .buy you are going with the trend and
following people who make the market. Therefore, you make the
moat money in the shortest period of time.

These examples of seven stocks are not exceptions, You
oan go over the list of stooks and pick out hundreds of them that
make moves of a similar.nature and you should always have the
average of the different groups, and when the average of the
groups show up or down, then pick out the stocks in strong
or weak position end watch them and buy when they make new highs,
or sell them at new lows; in the first.and. last stage of the mar-
ket you meke the most money in’ the shortest period of time.

You cannot make money without getting ready to make it
and in doing this you have to spend some money for charts, re-
coords, books and course of instruction. In this way you are
ready to follow the big men who make the market and make big
money.

STOCKS HOT MANIPULATED: Before the Stock Exchange started
regulating brokers and the control of markets}; there was maui-
pulation and pools often were organized that could advance low.
priced stocks that had very little merit to-extreme high levels.
This does not happen under present condiblors;..therefore, most
of the buying is by invostors and long term speculators and
there is practically no manipulation;. for this reason it is more
necessary to study the market carefully and study individual
stocks and get definite. indications that they are going to move
up, because they will not be put up just by manipulation, x6
they were years in the past. ‘Under’ present conditions more
traders and investors buy stooks on the prospects of dividends
and an increase in their investment. This you can do by-a
oareful study of all the rules:

NEW INDUSTRIES AND GROWTH-OF STOCKS: In the future, stocks
connected with thd atomic energy wikl naturally be leaders because
Like all new discoveries and inventions, it will prove to be very
valusble and a lot of companies will make a lot of money. These
compahias with prospects on the atomio stocks will be covered
later. In selecting stocks to buy under new industries, you.
should meke a careful study of their prospects and make :up cnerts
on the individual stocks that you intend to trade din, and if
they aro part of the group, you can get o record of the group
averago, study this. group avorage and then pick the individual
stock to buy that shows an indication of leading the group.

WRANIUM STOCKS: Uranium ia now one of the most valuable of all
pr-e of ous metols. Jt is much more valuable than gold end the
stooks that havo made divooverieas end havo Uranium deposits, such
stocks ag Vanadium have better prospects to be leaders in the
future. We will cover the other stocks later under the Uranium
Stooks.

VALUE OF ALL STOCKS LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHINGE: Tne
Department of Research and Statistios of the New York Stock
Exohange has done o mést valuable work for investors and they
deserve great oredit for it. At the end of each month they pub~
lish a total value of all stocks listed on the N. Y. Stock Ex-
change, the average value. of all stocks, the total mumber of
Btooka listed and the total number of shares and the total
value, that ia, the market value of each grap of stocks and
the average of 39 or more different groups. This is of great
value to any investor and trader who will study these records
and use them, as { will show how to do later with the charts
covering these averages and total value of stocks. Tho number
of stooka listed on the N. Y. Stock Exchange is 1536, The
total number of shares listed 4s 2 billion 936 million, nearly
S billion shares. The market value of all stocks listed on the
N. Y. Stock Exchange at the end of March 1934 was-nearly 125
billion dollara and the average price of all stocks wes 42.53,
this is the highest price in recent years.

1982, June - the total value of all stqcks was a little
léss than 16 billion dollars.

1928, November - the flat average price was 97.80 and
in March 1929 the average price was 96.67. August 31, 1929
tha total value of all stooks on the N. Y. Stock Exchange was
89 billion, 668 hundred million dollars.

1952, July 1 - the total number of companies on the
N.Y. Stock Exchange was 831; the total number of issues was
1255, and the number of shares was 1 billion, 315,334,428 and
at the present time the total number of shares listed is nearly
% billion. From this you can see that while the value of stocks
Vuererues, the number of shares is increasing all of the time.

1941, June was the last extreme low in stocks. At that
time the average price was 40.74 and the total value of all
stocks was$63,921,054, 342,

1960, May. The value of all stocks $85,624, 559,669.
The average price 48,48, When prices crossed the high of May
1946, they indicated much higher prices but of course, you
have to learn to pick the stocks in the strong groups to buy.

This was $3 1/3%. more than 1929 high.

1953, February low just below 119 billions. This was
$ montha with no gain, an indication that a reaction was due,
since June 1949 no reaction had been more than 5 billions
and e greater reaction was due, possibly 10 billions.

1953, August and September low slightly below 10 billions
or 2 times the previous reaction.

1953, October Average 116 billions above July 1953 high,
on indloation of higher prices.

1954, January the prices crossed 120 billions, the high
ef Dooember 1952. Again we would follow tho rule and buy at
new high levels, selecting the stocks in the groups which
showed strong up trend. (See.charts on U.S.Steel, Vanadium Steel,
and the Aircrafts end the average value of these). You can see
by the charts on Boeing, Douglas Aircraft, Glen Martin and
Vanadium Steel why we would select these stocks to buy and the
price of these stocks moved up fast in March and April 1954,

1954, Morch 31 the average value of ail stocks in the New
York Stock Exchange was just above 129 billion dollars. We now
come to the problem of estimating. when the average will meet
resigtenoe and good selling. fe use 1929 high of 90 billion
dollars and add 50% of this which would give 155 billion.

If we add or use approximately 325% on the high of April
1944, we get close to 135 billions as a selling level.

April 30, 1954 is 12 years from the low of April 30, 1942
and from Juno 30, 1932 low to April 30, 1954 is 262 months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averages made secondary highs at 2973
in April 1930. By going back over the past history you find
many changes in trend in April and May, therefore, the time is
near to watch for a change in trend in Stocks and groups like
Airorafte and Steels which have led the 1954 advanoe.

HOW MICH DECLINE TO EXPECT: Tha greatest decline since 1942 lows
was from February 1937 to March and April 1938. ‘The decline
was 3] billion 168 million dollars. The decline from May 1946
to February 1948 and June 1949 was 21 billion 785 million
dollars. This gives you a guide as to how much the first de-
oline may amount to.
206

The advance from June 1949 to dato has already exceeded
100% gain in value of all stocks and this would indicate that the
time is near for ot least a substantial corrective decline but
groups and. individual stocks must be studied to indicate their
strongth and weakness in relation to the average value of all
stocks.

WHEN STOCKS ARE IN THE STRONGEST AND WEAKEST PCSITION. When
a stock haa sold at very high levels declines and remains for
a very long timo at low levels and then finally crosses 50%
of. the highest prices at which it ever sold, or 50% between
the extreme Low and the oxtreme high, it is then in a very
strong position and indicates higher prices.

When a stock declines and breaks 50% of tne highest
prices ever aold, it is in a very weak position and as a gen-
eral rule when the stocks reach, this point they have a mo-
derate rally and sometimes it.is a final bottom for a big ad-
vance. The next important point is 50% between the extreme
high and the extreme low when stocks cannot hold this level
and break below it Hey are in the weakest possible position and
{ndioate much lower prices. In many cases a deoline tothese
points or a rally to these important 50% points remains for
weeks or months without advancing above the halfway point of
50% or breaking below it, but when once these points are ex-
ceeded, you should reverse the position. If you are short
oover shorts and buy. If you are long, sel} out longs and
sell short. In this way you will make mondy because you will
be going with the trend buying the stocks in the strongest
position and selling the stocks in the weakest position. You
must remember if it is time to gel] out a stook you are doing
it because in a weak position the trend is down and it .is
also equally good then to sell short following, of course, all
rules given in this book and all rules given in my book,

"45 YEARS IN WALL STREET". -

You must give the market time to show a ohange in
trend. Suppose people in the last two years have bought
Studebaker too high, Chrysler at high levels or Celanese.
When they saw thet the main trend had -changed,if.“they had a
5 point loss or even a 10 point lossif.'they sold out, took
the loss and went short, they would riot only make back the
loss they had but make big profits on the short side. This
is how money is made by going with the trend. Example: Celanese
high 58 in 1951, 50% of this is 29 in April 1953, Celanese
broke 29 ond never scold 2 points higher before it deolined
to 16 in April 1954. This is the proof of how weak stooks
get when once they have lost 50% of their value.

In 1953 Studebaker high 43%. 50% of this high prioe
is 21 3/45 after it broke this level in December 1953 it
never rallied 2 points befora it sold at 15 in April 1964,

another proof of why it pays to sell stocks short when they are
down 50% from the high level, because when you do this you are
going with the trend.

WHY IT 1S PROFITABLE TO BUY AT NEWHIGH PRICES AND SELL At
NEW LOW LEVELS :

When the stock is in a strong enough position to advance
to new highs after several months, weeka. or years it has re-
mained below these highs, it 1s strong as a sesult of good de-
mand and because powerful interests are buying; therefore, when
you buy you are going with the main trend and that's the right
way to make profits,

Never buck the trend, go with the trend always and
you'll make money.

When stocks decline to new low levels they are in a
weak position because the supply is greater than the cemand
and the selling is bottor than the buying, and for this good
reason you will be right 90% of the time if you sell stocks
when they are weak but olways protecting with a STCP LOSS
order based upon the rules.

MORE PROFITS IN SWINGS: If you will go over any active stock
over a périod of 5, 10 or 20 years ond note all moves of 10
points or more, you will see that there is mere profit trad-
ing for these swings than there is trading for dividends or
holding for big increase in capital.

From 1925, where Chrysler has started around 28, it
moved up to 141 and after having many swings up and dovm, ruh-
ning 10 to 50 and 75 points, it finally declined to 5 in 1932.
From 1932 up to 1954 Chrysler has made'a range from §5a share
to 141, a total of 136 points which would sive a profit of
£13,600 on 100 shares, During this same time, Chrysler, fi-
guring 10 point moves or more has made a total move of 1458
points, Just suppose you could catch 1/2 or 50% % of these
moves which would give 729 points profit against the range of
136 points. This is proof that it pays to trade for the swings.
That is, get out of the market when it shows an indication that
prices have reachod high and go short and then get in again
when thera is a definite indication that they have made low
trading in ond out and not holding and letting the market go up
and down over a poriod of years and receiving nothing but divi-
dends, finally winding up with a smallreturn on your capital
counting interest from the time you bought up‘to the time you
sold out. Go over any active stocks end you em prove this
to yourself.

iw
is

CHANGE WHEN THE TREND CHANGES: Conditions change from time to
time and tronds change after a period of time, and to moke
profits you must ohange with the trend and with the time.

Do not hold too long or hold just because you are reoceiv-

ing dividends; trade to increase your capital end do not worry
too much about dividends. ‘The value of any rules is, “¥11
it stand the test of time in astual trading?™. I offer
proof of all my rules such as buying at new highs and selling
at new lows by actual practice and prove to you that it does
pay to go with the trend and buy when stocks are reaching new
high levels end sell when they break into new low levels.

Go over the charts in the Course, Celanese, Douglas Aircraft,
Boeing, Lockheed, Glen Martin, Studebaker, United Aircraft
and Vanadium Steel and in this way you oan prove to yourself
how the: rulea work.

BUYING ONE STOCK AND SELLING ANOTHER SHORT AT THE SAME TIME:
fo prove iis rule, I show the chart on Celanese and Douglas
Airoraft and Studebaker and Vanadium Steel.

BUYING AND SELLING A DIFFERENT GROUP OF STOCKS AT THE SAME
TIME: 1951, July bought 100 Douglas at 48, August sold 100
Celenese at 52 when both stocks were selling at around the same
levels, Suppose you piaced a STOP LOSS order on Houglas at 45
and when you sold Celanese at 52 you placed a STOP at 59, 1
point abo’ 2 high of 56 in August. Suppose you do not buy
more Dougias which you should many times, baged on the rules
and shoula have scold short more Celanese based on the rules,
and could heave inads 9 lerger amount of money on a very small
risk. ,

Suppose in fpril 1954 when Douglas made the final grand
rush and was advarced crossing the high of 110, you finally
soldthe Douglas at 130; you wouH make 72 points on the Douglas
or £7,200 less interest and commission and at the same time you
buy in 100 short Celanese at 16 making 34 points at (3,400
profit, less commission, or a. total on the two trades of +10, 600
on a capital of 45,200, more than 100% in less than 3 years.
Refer to the chart on Studebaker and Vanadium Steel where we

show why, by buying Vanadium and selling Studebeker short, big
profits were made.

1951, March sell 100 Studebaker at 34 short because
there were twotops at 36 and tne third top was 35, a lower top,
place STOP at 37,

1951, August bought 100 Studebaker at 26 becanse 3 lows
around this same level and bought 100 Studebaker for long account.

195i, March bought 100 Vanadium at 32 because it was 6
months around ‘this low level at 31. Place STOP at 29.
1963, March sell 100 Vanadium at 444 because the higha
previously were 45 and 45% in August 1952 and Maroh 1952, making
this a doublé top.

1953, Merch sell 100 Vanadium short at 44%, place STOP
MG 47.

1953, February Studebaker high at 434 near the same level
as Vanadium. ; :

1953, March sold 100 Studebaker short at 384 and sold
100 Studebaker that we had for long account at 384, When it
broke under the low ofFebruary and the low of 39% made in May
1952, Place a STOP LOSS order on Studebaker, sold short at 4536

1953, June Studebaker broke 34, the low of October-
November 1952 and you should seil more at 31,

1953, June make STOP on 200 short at 34, Studebaker
continues to go down and_in September 1963 broke below 21 3/4,
a dooline of 50% from 434, rallied to only 26 and then broke
21 3/4 which indicated much lower.

1954, January and Fobruary high .21 3/4, avery weak rally,
remain. short of the 200 shares with STOP 22 3/46

1954, April 30 Studebaker low 15 main trand down. Profits,
4f you close all the Studebaker, is 60 points ‘or $6,000.

1961 March bought 100 Vanadium at 323-1953 sold 100 at
44% and sold short 100 at 44%,

1963 bought 100 to cover shorts of 31 because it was at
the low of April end May 1951 and at the same time we bought
100 Vanadium for long account at 31 md placed a STOP LOSS
order at 29, .

1954, February bought 100 Vanadium at 41 because it
was at the new high above 2 tops of 39% in July md August
1953, and above 2 tops of 395 in December 1953 and January 1954.

1954, March bought 100 Vanadium at 47 because it was
at new high levels above the high of August &: December “4998 & March 1953
showing main trend up and at the highest level since 1931,
indloating a very strong position.

1954, April Vanadium reached a high of 59 3/4. Note
September 1953 low of 302, add 50% gives 61 and a possible high.
The volume of sales was the largest for years indicating that it
might be reaching a possible top for reaotion anyway. So we
sell 300 gharos that were long at 5oy but would not go short be-
cause the main trond is stilj up. These shares which we sold
24,

wore bought at 31, 41, and 47. This gives a total of 57 points
profit or $5,700 less interest and commissione Add this to
$6,000. profit on Studebaker gives $11,500. in 3 years time on
a capital of about $3,500. or over 300% on the capital, or 1.00%
profit for each year by following rules and not guessing.

I have not picked these stocks because they wero exoep~
tions. There are many more in different groups thet would hava
made a showing equaily as good.

1955, Vanadium low 30% and Studebaker 28, just 4 points
apart

1954, April Vanadium was approximately 45 points higher
than Studebaker, a spread of 45 points in 7 months time. This
yroves that it pays to buy the stocks in strong position and

sell the ones jn weak position, which indicates main trend down.

LOW PRICED STOCKS DO NOT MOVE UF:

Changed conditions are the cause why low price stocks
er so called "cets and dogs have not followed the advance frou
September 1953 to April 1954, With the Dow Jones Stocks up 66
points in 7 months and the total value of al1 stocks listed
on the N Y Stook Exchange up about 24 billion dollars, thera
must be some reason why the low priced stocks have not followed
Foie advance.

In the old deys when pools operated and manipulation
end watchecd sales were permitted, the low priced stocks nearly
always advanced in the last stage of a bull market but it is not
the oase now because no pools are operating. The Investment
frusts, and the people with large amounts of money for invest~
ment buy into the strong companies where the earnings are good
and the dividend prospects are good. They buy good stocka
like General Motors, Standard of New Jersey, Amerioan Tel. &
Tel., Dupont, General Electric, Westinghouse, Douglas, U.S»
Steel, Bethlehem Steel and Vanadium Steel.

The public buys and holds the low priced stocks hoping
they will follow the high priced stocks and go up, but hope
will not put these low priced stocks up. fhe big people
don't want them and the result will be “many low priced stock
will decline faster in the next bear-market than the high pricad
stocks, Of coirse, the day will come when the great time cycle
indicates a great depression, that large and small investors
will lose confidence and sel} the blue chips when they are at
very low levels.
AIR CRAFT STOCKS ON THE WEW YORK Stock XCHANGE.

The Now York Stock Exohange, Department of desearch,
publishes at the ena of cach month the total value of all ;
airoroft stooks listed on the Exchange, and: this. chart ia very
veluable as a guide in selecting the best airoraft stooks to
buy on s31l, The chart woich we have made up on these aver-
ages we cail the Dollar Trend because it is not the average
price cf ytooka but the velue in dollars of the entire group,
aud thir 19 & more important trend. indicator than the average
price. Nuwsver, the Researoh Department does publish the
average value ofall airoraft stooks at the end of each month
48 woll as all other groups.

1951, September total value 1 billion, 136 mizlion
dollera. November low 955 million dollars,

1962, January 1 billion 10 million dollars, april
low 892 million dollars, This was the extreme low. At this
time you would look up the monthly high. and low, and weekly
high and low ohart on the individual atroraft stooks to dex
oide which 1s the best buy.

SELL ALRCRAPT.

April 1962, in a slow trading range, had been split
up and was not one of the best +o ouy at that time,

1953, September ~ it was making higher bottoma and
was better to buy. :

FORING AIRCRAFT.

April 1952, Made low in June after the stook was
#plit up and was good to buy, but was vetter to buy in
September 1963 because tho average value of all Airoraft
Stocks had made « now low, and were higher in September indionte
iug that the trend was turning up.

1064, February was the timo to buy Boeing for quiok

profits in a short period of time because it had-orosged old
high levels.

DIUGLASS AIRCRAFT,

. April 1952 was the very best buy among the Airoratts
havanse it had deolinea from 66% to 62, and 50% of the rango
from 434 to 664 was 55 and it closed in April 1962 at 67,
making it 9 good Ouy with STOP at BL.
1955, Soptembor Douglaas made low of G2. Tt had
making highar bottoms sinco April 1952 and 1t was one of t
very best stocks to buy, protected with STCP at 60. In De-
oember 1953 it orossed 74, the old high level, and was one Cs
the best stocks to buy fer a fast move up and large profits
in a short period.of time.

LOCKHEED AIRCRAFT.

In April 1952 it made higher bottoms but was slow be-
oause it had been split up, It was a much better stock to
buy in October 1953 when it crossed old tops.

GLEN L. MARTIN.

April 1952 was good to buy because it had held for
four months making higher bottoms than 1949 low, It was a
still better buy in September 1953 when it was crossing old
tops.

UNITED ATRCRAFT.

April, 1953 was a good stock to buy because it was
making higher bottoms but the big profits in’a short period
of time could have been made by buying in September 1953.

ALL ATRCRAFT STOCK AVERAGES.

1953, February the average was 1 billion 180 million
dollars,

1954, January the averages made a new high and in Fe-
bruary 1954 they were higher, and if you bought Douglass or
almost any other Aircraft Stock at that time you could have
made lerge profits in a short period of time.

1954, March $1 the average of all Airoraft Stocks was
1 billion 504 million dollars, the highest for many years,
and at the end of April 1954 they ‘had probably advanced 100%
from the oxtreme low of April 1952. (At this writing we do
not have the figures for the end of Aprit 1954).

39 STEEL AND IRON STCCKS AVERAGE VALUE.

Those figures are for the average price on tad last day
of each month. Study the chart in back of the book of in-
structions and it will help you to determine the trend cf tae
entire grotip of steel stocks and when you want to select the
best stosk to buy or sell, study the chart of the individual
steel stocks,
1951, September high 3 billion 805 million dollars.
From this level the trend turned down and made lower tops and
lower bottoma each month with no gain of more than 100 million
dollars in one month until April 1952 when the low was 3 billion
360 million dollars. The trend turned up from this low level
and July high 3 billion 635 million dollars.

1952, September and Ootober low 3 billion 384 million
dollars, a higher bottom and a buying level. At this time you
would look up the individual steel stocks in order to select
the best stocks to buy..

BETHLEHEM STEEL.

September 1952 low 47, higher than May 1952 and good
to buy with a STOP at 45, but it was a much better buy in
September 1953 when the average of all steel stocka waa
3 billion 105 million dollars. At thia time Bethlehem Steel
was gelling at 444, not S-points below the old bottoms and
good to buy with STOP at 43,

VANADIUM STEEL.

April 1952 low 364, good to buy because it was making
higher bottoms and you would have made fair profits buying
it at this time.

1952, September low 304, higher than the lows of 1950
and 1951,°a good buy with a STOP at 29, especially because it
had such good prospects for increased profits through its
Uranium mines. .

1954, February Vanadium was a safe and beat buy at 41
because it crossed the old high and you could buy more in
Merch 1954 when it crossed 47, the old highs, ond the average
value of all steel stocks was up at that time. Vanadium ad-
venced ta 69 3/4 in April 1954, end the volume of sales was
very large. If you were keeping up the daily and weekly high
and low chart, you would sell out at this time. It reacted
to 54 and then advanced to 659 agains It will have to de-
cline below 54 to indicate lower prices and when it crosses
60 ‘and closes above this level, the next resistance level is
-67 - 68; after this price is crossed, the next ‘price to watch
is 76%, the old high in March 191,

It will pay you to keep up the average value of each
group of stocks monthly and the average price of the group,
as well es the total value of all stocks listed on the NY
Stock Exchange oach month. These averages of value give you
the dollar trend which is much more accurato and valuable
than the Dow-Jones 30 Industrial Averages which cover only @
small percentage of tho total stocks listed.

Remember that the harder you work, the more knowledge
you will get, ond the more profits you will make. King
Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, shows wisdom and
understanding above everything else, You will do well to
follow his example. “Happy-is the man who findeth Wisdom,
and the man who getteth understanding". (Proverbs),

The rules which I have laid down in this course are
practical. I have followed them and made. money, and you can
follow them and make money. My greatest pleasure in life
comes from helping others.

"Tf J can throw a single ray of light,

Across the darkened pathway of another;

If I can aid some soul to clearer sight,

Of life and duty, and thus bless my brother;

If I can wipe from any human’ cheek a tear,

I shall not then have.lived in vain while here."

I am nearing my 76th birthday and I have realized
happiness and success. I feel that I have not lived in vain,
because thousands of people have benefited through my books
and my course of instructions and I feel confident they will
benefit, through the rules in this course, SPECULATION - &
PROFITABLE PROFESSION.
