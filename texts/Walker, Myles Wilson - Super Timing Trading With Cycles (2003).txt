                                      Trading with cycles
      The advantage of using cycles is that you can trade with more confidence.W.D.Gann
      always stated that
      time is more important than price and when time and price come together there is the
      potential for a
      change of trend.
      Also if you limit your trading to making entries on cycle days it substantially increases
      your chances of
      being a net winner.
      Super Timing is a book about cycles and how to find them.The main cycles that we use
      are based on
      the planetary aspects that I discovered when analyzing W.D.Ganns trades.

      An aspect is a term used in astrology.The 360 degrees of the circle are used and the
      distance around
      the edge of the circle is split into measurements of one degree the distances between two
      or more
      planets is called an aspect.

      The important aspects.
      Conjunction: Planets are at exactly the same degree or are seperated by no more than five
      degrees.
      Square: Planets are seperated by a distance of 90 degrees.
      Trine: Planets are seperated by 120 degrees.A grand trine is three planets each seperated
      by a
      distance of 120 degrees so that they each form one point of a triangle.
      Opposition: The planets are opposite each other with a 180 degree seperation.




      The aspects.

      Trading strategies.
      1) Use two or more contracts so that you can take partial profits quickly and then let the
      other run
         using a trailing stop or hold on to it until the next time cycle.
      2) As a general rule trail your entry stop a day before and after the cycle is due.
      3) Always use a stop loss and a stop profit.
      4) Remember that by its nature a cycle entry method is always at a minimum a short term

      counter
         trend trade and this can be stressful because you will be going against (what looks to
      be
        at the time) the crowd.
      5) Cycle points are not always tops or bottoms but can be the end of an area of price
      congestion.
         This is the force behind breakouts.
