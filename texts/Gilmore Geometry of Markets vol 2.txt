GEOMETRY OF MARKETS - II

INTRODUCTION

GEOMETRY OF MARKETS - II is a compilation of all the RELIABLE technical ap-
proaches to TIME, PRICE, PATTERN & TREND analysis I have researched and
studied or developed for my own use over the past 15 years.

Some approaches outlined here are methods directly promoted by well known analysts
such as W.D. Gann and R.N. Elliott or their students as well as many other lesser
known dedicated market experts. Many of the approaches detailed here are now held
out to be public domain knowledge, just the same these methods have been a basis for
further research and discovery given the advent of the computer analysis power we
have experienced in the last decade. Without the input of a dedicated few, those who
understood that markets work to a structure dictated by their past activity, we would
never have been able to advance our knowledge in such a relatively short period of
time.

It is my aim here to demonstrate the validity for the use of TIME, PRICE, PATTERN
& TREND analysis of markets as a LEADING TECHNICAL INDICATOR FOR
PREDICTING CHANGE OF TREND.

In doing so, I will endeavor to illustrate and explain the uses of these lesser known
technical techniques, their pitfalls and ways in which they can be enhanced to give bet-
ter results. To succeed in the volatile trading environment we are experiencing from
todays world of rapid communication requires a most sophisticated approach.

The origins of the mathematical ratios and the numbers I hold out to be important to
the time and price analysis of markets are explained in the appendices. If one can

rasp the significance of the origins of these ratios and numbers it will provide a base
or their successful use in the future.

It should be noted that every mathematical ratio or number employed in the analysis
of markets, put forward in this text, has an ancient origin. In fact every ratio or number
we will use in the analysis of markets has been enshrined in such ancient works as the
Great Pyramid, the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato and Archimedes.

Also the ratios we use are common to the structure of music, works of art, the interre-
lated motion of the planets and in general the natural growth of marine and plant life.

The way in which we utilize these ratios and numbers is termed "philosophical
geometry".

To perform enlightened time and price analysis requires a medium from which to
study market behavior. The GEOMETRY OF MARKETS medium is in the accurate
charting of price movement in time for any commodity contract, stock price or price
series we wish to trade.

The principles and methods outlined in this text will, without doubt, prepare the astute
analyst for the future better than any other doctrine published on the technical analysis
of markets. When used in conjunction with the knowledge of market momentum, wave
structure and "market intuition" the results will be astounding.

The road to success for the market analyst is in studying past time and price patterns,
recognizing repetition and the strength of certain events. When similar patterns occur
in the future they stand out and provide "set ups" for trading opportunity. The future in
many ways is simply a repetition of the past. Price activity may not always be identical
but, it will most surely be similar.

Recognizing opportunity is a prerequisite to success in the markets. Once you have an
understanding of the geometric relationships that manifest themselves within market
activity you will find that "trading set ups" just keep coming one after the other.
GEOMETRY OF MARKETS - II

About the contents of this manual...

The first part of this text devotes itself to the explanation of the most valuable tools
available to students of TIME, PRICE, PATTERN & TREND analysis.

The text begins by outlining only the most important TIME & PRICE TOOLS I use
on a day to day basis. These tools are the result of years of research and study. There
are others, but I have concluded they are not necessary of explanation and are redun-
dant to the overall cause.

I have kept the TECHNICAL TOOLS reference chapters 1 - 7 as brief and to the |
point as I possibly could, this way you will be able to refer to the major points easily in
the future.

Chapter two outlines several reliable DAILY PRICE PATTERNS that can give ad-
vance warning when a change of trend is taking place.

Chapter three contains a summary of the TREND INDICATORS 1 use in my day to
day analysis of markets.

Chapter four gives an outline on ELLIOTT WAVE and the important points I have
found useful for the type of analysis we need to conduct.

Chapter five addresses the concept on CYCLES and how they can influence market
trends. A concise explanation is given to the way in which planetary events can be
monitored as an additional signal to the TIME ANALYSIS: TOOLS explained earlier
in chapter one.

Chapter six contains a summary of the time analysis model, WINDOWS OF OPPOR-
TUNITY, I use to remove the subjectivity from future time calculations.

Chapter seven TRADING FOR PROFITS addresses the important issues necessary
for success when you come to trading markets.

APPENDIX 1 contains a complete outline of the sacred mathematical relationships of
ANCIENT GEOMETRY & NUMEROLOGY.

As an additional reference I have included the WAVE TRADER DIGESTS for the
entire of 1992. These digests were written on a monthly basis with the intention of
alerting users to the geometry, numerology and techniques of trend identification that
are SO Important to the analysis of markets.
TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

TIME & PRICE TOOLS

Before we can start to discuss the intricate possibilities provided by time and price
analysis, we first need to become familiar with the foundations.

By foundations I am referring to the TOOLS or rather the mechanics and theory of
measuring time and price relationships within the market. :

In this chapter I am going to outline all the time and price measuring techniques I
know to be reliable and give you examples of each. Later on in this book I will show
you how you can use these techniques to predict a change of trend in advance, or at
worst on the day it occurs.

TIME measuring techniques center around counting off time between market pivot
points. The time factors of a trend can be either STATIC or DYNAMIC.

° Static time is the COUNT in days, weeks or years from one market trend
change pivot point to another.

e Dynamic time is the RATIO RELATIONSHIP of two static time counts
to one another.

e The analysis procedures we use are called COMPOSITE COUNTS,

TIME CYCLE RATIOS and SOLAR TIME DURATION.

PRICE measuring techniques are similar to time techniques in that we measure the
price change between two market pivot points.

e Price change can be made in either UNITS OF PRICE or PERCENT-
AGE CHANGE TO PRICE.

e Price relationships can be either STATIC or DYNAMIC.

e The analysis procedures we use are called PRICE RETRACEMENTS,
PRICE PROJECTIONS, PRICE SQUARING (% CHANGE) and
PRICE COUNTS.

rane is a combination of TIME & PRICE. I commonly refer to space as VIBRA-

e VIBRATION is the immaginary line drawn between two market pivot
oints. The rate of change of that line can be measured in PRIC
NITS per DAY, WEEK or YEARS.

e Space relationships can be either STATIC or DYNAMIC.

e The analysis procedures we use are called GANN ANGLES and
DYNAMIC VIBRATION RATIOS.

The tools you are about to be shown are known as LEADING INDICATORS. They
should only be used for trading in conjunction with trend and pattern analysis.
TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

BAR CHARTS

The time and price technician needs a source from which to make the necessary cal-
culations. This is provided by a standard BAR CHART.

The benefits of keeping an up to date bar chart of the price movement of any market
are numerous.

° You have a visual picture of the price activity for the duration of the
chart. From this you immediately have a perspective of the long-term
trends.

e You have a diagrammatic record from which to conduct your analysis.

e All your calculations can be recorded for future reference.

The standard conventions used to explain a markets position are:-

° Bull market trend
° Bear market trend
° Minor / Intermediate / Major or Primary degree
e Swing pivot - Minor / Intermediate / Primary
e Impulse wave pattern
e Corrective wave pattern
e Price range = vertical price units moved in a trend
e Time count/cycle = time taken between swing pivots

COMPUTER GENERATED ANALYSIS & ACCURACY

These days I prepare and conduct all of my analysis on computer. It is far easier to
maintain charts and manipulate data. It is also no trouble to follow 20 or more com-
modities or stocks.

When making time and price calculations the time and price analyst needs to follow a
strict set of rules. The data source needs to be accurate and have a built in system to
detect errors. For short term analysis errors need to be detected daily, for long-term
analysis at least on a weekly or monthly basis. If not you could be placing yourself in
jeapody.

When making analysis calculations the rules I use are:-

A PIVOT DAY is always the actual trading day on which the extreme high or low was
registered by the exhausted trend.

TIME COUNTS are always made from the actual date of the pivot day.

PRICE CALCULATIONS are only taken using the EXTREME HIGH OR LOW
registered on the pivot date.

From time to time when double tops or bottoms are made you may have some doubts
about which date is more important, if so make calculations from both dates. Eventual-
ly as the market works its way along it will become evident which top or bottom was
the most harmonious in the bigger picture.

Computer users please take note....

Some software applications do not have the ability to make calculations directly from
the screen price highs or lows. They use a marker system which moves in increments
related to the screen pixels. When making RETRACEMENT calculations these can
normally be up to 5% out in their targets.

The CYCLETRADER software I have used to prepare the illustrations in this book
was designed and exclusively programmed by myself to provide the most accurate way
of implementing the procedures you are about to learn.

CYCLETRADER makes its calculations from the actual price data on the screen, ac-
curacy is guaranteed to three decimal places. You will be amazed sometimes how the
market trades precisely to within less than 1/3rd of 1% tolerance of the ideal calcula-
tion or ratio you are expecting.
TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

COMPOSITE TIME COUNTS

In modern days composite time counts have been popularized by students of EL-
LIOTT WAVE and GANN WORKS.

A trend change could occur at precise time intervals counted from previous market
pivot points.

DIVISIONS AND MULTIPLES OF A YEAR

0.236, 0.25, 0.333, 0.382, 0.50, 0.618, 0.667, 0.707, 0.75, 0.786, 0.
1.414, 1.50, 1.618, 1.732, 1.75, 2.000, 2.236, 2.50, 2.618, 3.000, 3.
6.00 and 6.854.

From thereon be aware of anniversaries from important major trend change pivots.

33, 4.000, 4.236, 5.00,

FIBONACCI SERIES

The most common counter series used today is the FIBONACCI SERIES of numbers.
Anyone familiar with R.N. Elliott’s WAVE PRINCIPLE will be aware of the impor-
tance attached to this series, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987
and so forth with each future number maintaining a 1.618 relationship to its predeces-
sor.

Counts can be performed in TRADING DAYS, CALENDAR DAYS, SOLAR
DEGREES, WEEKS, MONTHS and even YEARS.

Multiples and squares of the Fibonacci series, such as:-

34 68, 102, 136, 170, 204, 238.
55 110, 165, 220, 275, 330, 385.
89 178, 267, 356, 445, 534, 623.
144 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008.
233 466, 699, 932, 1165

13 squared = 169

21 squared = 441

34 squared = 1156

55 squared = 3025

Some of these numbers can be arrived at by different means for instance 238 calendar
days = 34 weeks, 385 a master number in days = 55 weeks. 3025 a master number in
days = 432 weeks.

I’ve highlighted the medium term counts I’ve seen occur regularly in calendar days.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

LUCAS NUMBER SERIES

These numbers have the same properties as the Fibonacci series in so far as each suc-
cessive number in the series relates to its predecessor by the ratio of 1.618.

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364, et cetera.

These numbers can have a dynamic relationship with the Fibonacci series of numbers.
For instance 322 divided by 144 results in 2.236 or \/5. (2.236 = » + /¢)

There are other numbers we could place importance on for composite time counts,
these are mentioned in the appendices under Ancient Numerology.

WHAT CONSTITUTES A VALID COMPOSITE COUNT SIGNAL ?

The most reliable COMPOSITE TIME SIGNALS I have experienced are when you
et a combination of DIVISIONS OF A YEAR together with FIBONACCI or
UCAS COUNTS in days and weeks. Weekly time counts are extremely reliable.

The reason for this is due to the fact that these counts will form dynamic time relation-
ships between the various market pivot points and the current point where you are ex-
pecting an exhaustion of trend.

For instance a termination of trend is more likely to occur when you have multiple
counts from a series of previous market pivots. Fnormally check the past 8 INTER-
MEDIATE DEGREE market pivots for COMPOSITE TIME COUNTS before worry-
ing about pivots further afield.

When calculating composite counts you should allow for some under or over shooting
of the ideal number. A difference of 1% is not uncommon. Here is an example of
some composite counts I saw when the JAPANESE YEN made high on July 2, 1992.

TIME CYCLE RATIOS

Time cycle ratio analysis of market activity is the single most important technical tool
in determining the termination of a trend. The objective is to evaluate the strength of
the signals; first having regard to the QUALITY of the ratios signaled, secondly the
QUANTITY of the signals and thirdly the RHYTHM of the signals.

All the ratios used for time and price analysis can be divided into families. The family
groups are called GEOMETRIC, HARMONIC and ARITHMETIC ratios.

GROUPS CONTRACTING EXPANDING
GEOMETRIC 1.000 1.000
0.786 1.272

0.167 6.000
ROOT 5 0.447 2.236
0.200 5.000
TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

QUALITY ratios in the primary sense are the ones I have highlighted.

I feel quite confident in Predicting a change of trend in advance when I see multiple
time cycle ratios of 0.382, 0.500, 0.707, 1.000, 1.414, 1.618 and 2.000 appearing in con-
junction with important COMPOSITE COUNTS.

Nevertheless it must be remembered that every market turning point cannot keep
vibrating on these ratios alone. If it did it would be a perfect system and this just isn't
the case. This is why it is important to look for RHYTHM as well as QU ITY.

QUANTITY can be made up from any of the ratios, the more prime ratios the better.

RHYTHM is a matter of judgement, I will give you some examples as we move along.
If you study the tables on the previous page you will see how I have grouped the ratio
series for each of the NAMED families. When you are analysing your charts and you
can identify a pattern of previous market Pivots being made on an expanding or con-
tracting series of ratios from the one family, you are seeing what I call rhythm.

Once a rhythm is identified it gives you a better focus on where to expect the next
trend change. If a new shock hits a market "out of the blue", for instance a war breaks
out or the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates by an excessive amount and the market
goes "haywire" for a while, then you can expect to see the rhythm change. It may well
return after the dust settles so don’t forget about it entirely.

WHAT IS A TIME CYCLE RATIO?

A time cycle ratio is the projection of time of a previous market trend or a series of
market trends (pivot date to pivot date) into the future, using the ratios listed. A time
cycle is the length of time of a previous trend, be it a bear or bull trend. Since each
larger degree trend is broken into smaller trends with counter degree trends we have
to look at time cycles in the context of degree. The degrees I will talk about are
PRIMARY, INTERMEDIATE and MINOR.

TIME CYCLE RATIOS IN PRACTICE

As a market moves along I tag each of the confirmed MINOR, INTERMEDIATE and
PRIMARY degree SWINGS. I keep this information in a computer fact file for rapid

analysis into the past and future of the market in question.

The IMM DEUTSCHE MARK recently made a major low on the 20th March, 1992. The

CALCULATING TIME CYCLE RATIOS IN ADVANCE

When one has the knowledge of how market TIME CYCLE RATIOS manifest them-
selves within market activity it is a simple matter to calculate them in advance.

The objective is to isolate the future dates where there is a QUANTITY of QUALITY
SIGNALS. In the case of the previous Deutsche Mark example I have prepared a
TIME CYCLE REPORT sorted into chronological order for the area of the March 20
ow.

This report was prepared from the information obtainable after the 7th February, 1992
swing high was identified.

Remember all of these calculations were made prior to the actual market reversal day.

PRIMARY DEGREE TIME CYCLE RATIOS

Whenever a market makes an IMPORTANT DEGREE trend change there should al-
ways be evidence of TIME CYCLE RATIOS originating from previous swings of
primary degree.

To take the 20th March, 1992 DEUTSCHE MARK example further I have illustrated
below how several long-term market swings added to the QUALITY and QUANTITY
of the signals already discussed.

The first high on the chart 871231 came at the end of a bull market that began in early
1985. You can see from the chart that the other two swings used, ie., 890615 and
910211 are visually the extreme low and high made after the 871231 high. The three
most important highs and lows in seven years.

The TIME CYCLE RATIO of 871231-910211 to 920320 came out at precisely 0.354
(one quarter of root 2).

890615-910211 to 920320 came in at 0.665 and the total time from 890615 to 920320
was 1009 days or 144 weeks.

The analysis presented here is not difficult to obtain either in advance or at the time of
interrogation of a new swing high or low, so long as you have the COMPUTER

To extract the information presented here took me approximately 10 minutes to work
out on the 19th March, 1992. Although it has taken me ten years to perfect my system
to perform this task that’s another matter.

If you would like to perform accurate TIME & PRICE analysis as quickly as I do you
will need to set yourself up as I have. CYCLETRADER is easy to use once you under-
stand the philosophies explained within this text.

KEEPING TRACK OF TIME CYCLE RATIOS

It is important to keep your records in a methodical manner if you wish to keep track
of the market cycles.

I do it by keeping an ongoing SWING FILE for each commodity or stock I follow. The
swing file contains all the dates and prices of the past INTERMEDIATE &
PRIMARY SWINGS.

I edit out the lesser degree swings as they become redundant to my future analysis.

By having the swing information on hand I can calculate TIME CYCLE RATIOS for
ranges that may have taken decades, accurately to the day.

Below is an example of my IMM DEUTSCHE MARK swing file and the raw informa-
tion I keep in it.

PROJECTING PRIMARY TIME CYCLE RATIOS
I normally project single cycles and dual cycles from common pivots.

For instance to identity the QUANTITY and QUALITY of signals for the IMM
Deutsene Mark 920320 low would have required multiple TIME CYCLE PROJEC-

Of the eight (8) TIME CYCLE PROJECTIONS listed below four (4) had vibrations falling
between the 19th and 22nd March, 1992. These types of TCR’s can be calculated wel
in advance of a projected change in trend if needs be. The TCR report begins the |
projection calculations at 0.236 then uses the Geometric, Harmonic and Arithmetic

progressions.

FUTURE TIME CYCLE RATIO PROJECTIONS

After new highs or lows are identified and confirmed as primary swing points one simp-
ly adds these into the future time cycle projection file.

For instance, now that the Deutsche Mark March 20, 1992 low has been confirmed as
an IMPORTANT DEGREE SWING I can add these to the existing time cycle projec-
tions.

920108 - 920320 Most recent high to low.
920702 - 920320 Most recent low to low.

After new time cycles are added to the report file I can run a sort for any future period
of time. I normally look for primary trend changes to occur between three and six
months ahead to begin with. I can always prepare another report if I need to look fur-
ther ahead.

SOLAR TIME

Throughout this text I will be talking about SOLAR TIME. By solar time I am refer-
ring to the TIME PERIODS IN DEGREES FROM THE CIRCLE OF ONE YEAR.

Each year the Earth passes through one orbit around the Sun. Each orbit can be
divided into 360 degrees as opposed to 365.25 days. Because the path the Earth takes
in its orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle but in fact an ellipse (an oval), the
passage of time in degrees is not constant with the calendar days.

For instance each 90 degree segment of the 360 degree circle is not regular in days by
direct proportion as 1/4 of 365.25 or 91.3 days. Depending upon. the seasonal time of
the year 90 degrees on the SOLAR CIRCLE could take 89 days, 93 days or some-
where. in between.

Now the consequence of this speeding up and slowing down in the relationship be-
tween days and degrees can create errors when one converts calendar days into
divisions of a year. For instance half a year 0.500 (180 degrees) is not always going to
be 182.5 days, in fact it could on occasions be either 180 days, 185 days or somewhere
in between.

One might say this difference is marginal and not particularly important! Well 5 days

in the market can be an awefully long time when you are trying to pinpoint a
CHANGE OF TREND DATE.

DIVISIONS OF A YEAR TIME COUNTS

The only accurate way to count divisions of a year correctly is by using the 360 degree
circle and the passing of time in SOLAR DEGREES.

GANN SQUARES OF 90 & 144

Gann squares of 90 and 144 are directly related to the circle. 90 degrees is a 1/4 (one
quarter) and 144 degrees is 2/5 (two fifths).

The GANN way to use these squares in the analysis of time within market cycles is by
COUNTING OFF SQUARES OF TIME IN SOLAR DEGREES.

FIBONACCI COUNTS IN SOLAR DEGREES

It is a legitimate analysis technique to count off SOLAR DEGREES in Fibonacci num-
bers. Interestingly it often happens that 233 degrees falls exactly on 34 weeks and 377
degrees falls exactly on 55 weeks, all Fibonacci numbers. The Gold complex vibrates
reliably to these time counts, in the past I have nailed many intermediate degree highs
and lows because of this knowledge.

TIME CYCLE RATIOS IN SOLAR DEGREES

It is important that you are aware of the time cycle vibrations between market pivots
in both SOLAR DEGREES and CALENDAR DAYS.

There is little need to worry about SOLAR DEGREES once the time span being

projected is greater than two years, for long durations CALENDAR DAYS will give
the result quite accurately.

You could perhaps use horoscope circle charts sold in "mystical book shops" or you
could use a HELIOCENTRIC EPHEMERIS.

I have produced an accurate TIME CALCULATOR to measure both calendar days
and SOLAR DEGREES between any two dates that I choose.

Here is an example of one report I use to measure the various time counts from pre-
vious market swing dates to a future date. As each time period is calculated I have it
checked with a number bank to see if it fits any of the criteria I have outlined so far.

The codes beside the counts are an abrieviation for the various COMPOSITE TIME

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

PRICE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN MARKET TRENDS

The PRICE measuring techniques I will show you will always identify a market rever-
sal. The nature of the reversal can be estimated by the TIME signals present when the
PRICE signals are evident, taking into account the degree of market activity you are
measuring.

L use the same filtering mechanism QUALITY, QUANTITY and RHYTHM for price as
I do with time.

Price calculations are made using the same ratios I listed on page 8 of this manual.

Two important analysis rules I always use:-

PRICE SIGNALS WITHOUT TIME SIGNALS are never a reliable indication of a
trend change - at best they can be tradable reaction points.

PRICE SIGNALS AND TIME SIGNALS TOGETHER will generally signal a setup
for a reversal of trend, PROVIDED there is multiplicity and rhythm evident within the
ratios.

The measuring techniques IJ always consider for price analysis are:-

° PRICE UNIT RETRACEMENTS (INTERNAL & EXTERNAL)

e PRICE UNIT RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVIOUS RANGES

° PRICE RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVIOUS RANGES IN % CHANGE
° PRICE UNIT PROJECTIONS

e PRICE UNIT EXPANSIONS

e COUNTING % CHANGE IN PRICE

e COUNTING PRICE UNITS

One should not be overcome by the number of measuring techniques available for
price.

The primary tools I use are:-

RETRACEMENTS, RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVIOUS RANGES IN UNITS AND
PERCENTAGE CHANGE.

Nearly every important change in trend in any market will have signals generated by
these three tools.

My important filter when using the other techniques is this - if no signals are evident

from my primary techniques I fade the signal day, at least until I get proper confirma-
tion of a change in trend.

18
TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

PRICE UNIT RETRACEMENTS (INTERNAL)

This tool is the most common technique used in the analysis of market price move-
ment.

Nevertheless it has limitations!

Retracement is the term used to describe the price movement when a market is trad-
ing within the confines of a previous range.

Whilst a current trend is trading within the confines of a previous range it should be
considered as a correction to the previous range.

Markets can make a full (100%) retracement of a previous range and still be correc-
tive in the longer-term perspective.

When calculating retracement targets there are several rules that can be used, these re-
late to an Elliott Wave perspective. For instance 0.236, 0.333, 0.382 and 0.447 price
retracements are more common in 4th and 6th waves. 0.500, 0.618, 0.786 and 1.000
retracements are more likely to occur in 2nd waves. 0.500, 0.526, 0.577, 0.667 and

0.707 are likely to occur in "B" waves. Retracements of less than 0.500, ie., 0.236, 0.333,
0.382 and 0.447 generally infer that the next expansion wave will be dynamic and ex-
ceed the previous high or low of the range from which it has been measured.

In the time examples I showed how the DEUTSCHE MARK low on 20th March, 1992
was made on QUALITY time signals, now I can show you how these signals coincided
with the geometric price activity that day.

DEUTSCHE MARK makes a 0.618 price retracement to the previous PRIMARY DE-
GREE TREND 20th March, 1992.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

PRICE UNIT RETRACEMENTS (EXTERNAL)

External price retracements are another way of measuring relationships between ad-
jacent trends once the new trend has exceeded the 100% level.

This technique is used for measuring the structure of an ongoing trend within a larger
degree trend.

The DEUTSCHE MARK correction from 8th January, 1992 to 20th March, 1992 un-

folded in three minor degree waves. The last two waves, made up of the first correc-

tion from the 920108 high and the thrust into the 0.618 level shown on the previous

pase, Should normally be related if a change in trend was to be expected on 20th
arch, .

The relationship unfolded in an ideal way in this example because the final thrust re-
lated to the previous correction by a factor of 1.618.

The ideal ratios to watch for in circumstances like this are 1.414, 1.618, 1.732, 2.000,
2.236 and 2.618.

In this example the CYCLETRADER has measured the relationship of the correction
as 3.25 basis points and the thrust as 5.30 basis points, The relationship of 5.30 divided
by 3.25 is 1.631. If the ratio was going to be exactly 1.618 the price move in the thrust
would have been 1.618 of 3.25 or 5.26. The overlap of 0.04 is acceptable given that it
was needed to get the price level closer to the PRIMARY 0.618 target.

Often price relationships will unfold in perfect ratios other times they can fall short or
overshoot and have what GANN referred to as "lost motion". In the past I have stuck
to a rule of not allowing for more than a 2% "lost motion" factor when placing a
market order and stop loss. For instance 1% of 3.25 equals 0.0325 therefore the ex-
treme of 2% equals 0.065. You can’t trade 0.005 tics so your extreme point needs to be
set at 0.07, ie., 3.25 by 1.618 = 5.26 +/- 0.07. Anywhere between 5.19 and 5.33 would
be acceptable for a 1.618 relationship with 3.25. When the ranges increase in mag-
nitude I normally reduce my percentage degree margin for "lost motion" and wor
strictly on a managable dollar value in trading tics. On many occasions my percentage
error factor is down to 1/3rd of 1% tolerance.

PRICE UNIT RELATIONSHIP TO 1st ALTERNATE WAVE

The Ist ALTERNATE wave is that wave once removed from the current wave that
trended in the same direction. The 1st Alternate wave will not always show relation-
ships with the current trend, but in any case where the retracement wave does not
register relationships, the Ist Alternate should do so if a reversal in trend is to occur.

In a 5 wave movement where the Sth wave is an impulse wave you can compare wave 5
to the 1st Alternate (wave 3) and the 2nd Alternate (wave 1). In a case where you get
1st and 2nd Alternate wave relationships together with a retracement relationship of
larger degree, you have a very strong signal.

The ist and 2nd Alternate waves should also be given high priority when evaluating
sideways markets.

When the current wave in progress is considered a wave 4 (corrective wave) then this
wave should not exceed 100% of the 1st Alternate wave, ie., the first correction in the
series, wave 2. If the magnitude of wave 4 exceeds wave 2 this is known as OVER
BALANCING PRICE. In the event that price is being overbalanced you could get an
early warning of a new trend of larger degree in progress.

A simple rule to follow is - corrections should continue to become smaller as a trend
progresses. If not the degree of trend has changed.

Below we see the example of the 1st Alternate wave, in the DEUTSCHE MARK
decline from 8th January, 1992 to 20th March, 1992, relating 1.000 to 1.000 ap-
proximately with the final wave in a three wave movement, which terminated on a
retracement level of the wave of larger degree. There is again some "lost motion" in
this example.

PRICE RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVIOUS RANGES IN % CHANGE

PERCENTAGE CHANGE is the percentage difference of the starting price of a
range to its ending price. For example if a market range started at 100 and ended at
150 the percentage change of the range would be 50%:

In the example below the % change of the bull move was 21.74%

Starting price 54.01 DMARK 910702 LOW

Ending price 65.75 DMARK 920108 HIGH

price units in range 11.74 65.75 LESS 54.01

% change 21.74% 11.74 divided by 54.01 mult by 100

To calculate percentage change the price units in the range are always divided by the
Starting price.

The % change in the bearish move was 10.95%

Starting price 65.75 DMARK 920108 HIGH
Ending price 58.55 DMARK 920320 LOW

price units in range 7.20 65.75 LESS 58.55

% change 10.95% 7.20 divided by 65.75 mult by 100

The percentage change relationship in the retracement was 10.95% divided by 21.74%
in the expansion results in 0.504. This coincided with a price retracement of 0.618 (see
page 19). The two signals together are extremely important to market analysis for locat-
ing "set ups" and a reversal of trend.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

Percentage change relationships between adjacent price ranges and the ist Alternate
price range are the most important. Quite often when there is little or no evidence of
price unit relationships between market pivots % CHANGE will provide the answer.

Some exchange contracts such as INTEREST RATE FUTURES, T-BOND FU- |
TURES and CURRENCY RATE FUTURES will manifest % change relationships
more often than price unit relationships. So it is important to monitor them when
TIME is signalling a potential for a change in trend.

It must be remembered that each individual market will form geometric patterns, in
important ratios, as it moves from low to high and high to low. These patterns can only
be identified by using all of the tools all of the time.

If you choose to use only some of the tools, some of the time, you will never be in a
position to make fast judgements on the market position.

So far I have outlined the most important tools for price analysis.

Before we move on here is one more example of % CHANGE relationship for the
DEUTSCHE MARK low of March 20, 1992.

The preceding BEAR MARKET from 910211 to 910702 declined 21.86% in value.
The following BULL MARKET from 910702 to 920108 rose 21.74% (see previous
page). These two waves related 1.00 to 1.00 in % CHANGE at the 920108 high. The
AR TREND down to 920320 declined 10.95% and had a 0.501 % CHANGE
relationship with the Ist Alternate wave of primary degree. The progression in %
CHANGE unfolded as 1.000 : 1.000 : 0.500 and you can’t get a more GEOMETRIC
PATTERN than that. The real issue here I am pointing out is the RHYTHM

PRICE UNIT PROJECTIONS & EXPANSIONS

Price unit projections and expansions are tools for estimating future market support or
resistance.

Once a move has been in progress for some time, ie., after several impulse waves have
taken shape. It is possible to use the existing waves to calculate areas where a price
level will be intersected by two or more separate calculations. These are areas of high
probability for a change in trend or a reaction to trend.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

These tools are particularly helpful when a trend is impulsing to a new vibration rather
than reacting to an old vibration. For instance a trend will be seen to be impulsing
when it fails to react on retracement levels of a previous range.

Normally projections and expansions are made using range extremes, ie., low to high
or high to low. Projections can be made using highs to highs and lows to lows, I would
call these inside projections.

DIVISIONS OF A RANGE

The problem arises, with so many ways of calculating possible price support and resis-
tance levels, it is better to monitor a trend each day by dividing the total range into
divisions, this way you can see if past pivots fall on strict ratio levels.

When past market pivots intersect ratio divisions of the total range you can see har-
mony in the price activity and predict support and resistance as it occurs. Often you

will see a day or two before that a final thrust will bring a number of previous pivots
into harmony. You will know the ratios so you can work out the price in advance.

This Deutsche Mark example should explain the technique clearly when taken in con-
text with the two previous examples of price projections and expansions.

A 1.618 price projection for termination of trend means that the projected wave will
be a 0.382 distance of the total move.

A 1.000 price projection or a 2.000 price expansion means that the projected wave will
be half 0.500 of the total move.

Be alert to any market pivot, be it a high or a low in the total move, intersecting a
major division ratio, ie., 0.293, 0.333, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.667 and 0.707.

COUNTING % CHANGE IN PRICE

Percentage change increases or decreases in strict ratios between market lows to highs
or highs to lows, in trends of either Minor, Intermediate or Primary degree can often
coincide with an end to that trend.

For instance a market may rise or decline 33.3% or 50% in value from an extreme low
or high to the termination of that trend. Other percentage changes to monitor are the
natural ratios we use for all other time and price calculations.

Some commodities and stocks, ones which regularly make large percentage moves,
lend themselves to this technical indicator.

Although I monitor percentage change relationships between all recent market pivots
to any new pivot, I would not consider acting on this indicator alone.

From my own experience % CHANGE COUNTS falling on strict ratios such as 20%,
23.6%, 25%, 33.3%, 38.2%, 50%, 57.7%, 61.8%, 66.7%, 70.7%, 78.6%, 100% and so
on, are more likely to occur in Primary bull or bear campaigns.

When the % CHANGE COUNTS are present there are normally plenty of other im-
portant dynamic price relationships to confirm the termination of a trend. It often
seems to me they occur more infrequently than their monitoring is worth. Nevertheless
if you have the facility to monitor them quickly they could help confirm a change of
trend from a trading point of view. Often they can jump out at you when you least ex-
pect them.

There is an old Gann saying which states, "Use all of the tools all of the time”. For this
reason I make sure I monitor market moves for % CHANGE COUNTS.

The example below shows the BRITISH POUND in US DOLLARS rising exactly
33.2% between the 1989 bear market low and the 1991 bull market high.

COUNTING PRICE UNITS

Important counts to monitor are the same numerological counts used for COM-
POSITE TIME COUNTS. Refer to page 6 for reference.

Counting price unit moves between market pivots is the least important price analysis
tool I know of. So much unwarranted importance has been attributed to this technique
by numerous writings I have witnessed.

In defence of this technique I can only say it seems to manifest itself in different ways
within different complexes. For instance the Gold market seems to terminate trends
of various degree on a regularly basis in price units related to the Fibonacci series.

Perhaps the most important observation I have made is this:-

When a retracement or projection of a previous trend, which itself was a price unit in-
crease or decrease falling on an important number, falls on another important number
the chances of a reversal to trend have a higher degree of probability. The reason for
this is obviously because the numerological values will themselves hold some
DYNAMIC ratio relationship.

My view when counting price units is the same as counting % change in price, ie.,
en a number of technical indicators all fall together it helps cement in your mind
the fact that market movement is anything but random.

The example below occured in the Ist Month Comex Gold futures. A major bear
market from 1983 to 1985 terminated after a fall of $232.80 (233) a Fibonacci number.
A subsequent rally high terminated after a rise of $88.20 (89), another Fibonacci num-
ber, from the 1985 low. This in itself was a 0.382 retracement level to the previous
primary bear market. The next rally high terminated after a price unit count of $161.80
(1.618) from the 1985 bear market low. The time from the 1985 bear market low was
1.618 years and the % change count was 57.7% (0.577). It just goes to show it pays to
"Use all of the tools all of the time" if you are to uncover the truth about market
geometricity.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

SPACE ANALYSIS (THE INTEGRATION OF TIME & PRICE)

I commonly refer to SPACE analysis as VIBRATION.

SPACE or VIBRATION can be represented as the immaginary line drawn between
two market pivots. Each pivot represents the begining and the end of a market vibra-
tion. The vibration rate is the average RATE OF PRICE MOVEMENT PER DAY, DE-
GREE, WEEK or YEAR between the two market pivots.

To calculate market vibration rates we use the co-ordinates from two pivots. These are
usually from a market high to a low or vice versa. Although it is possible to measure
the vibration rate between any two market pivots be they high to high or low to low
you will find that these are secondary techniques mostly redundant to our particular
analysis.

The co-ordinates we use are the date and the price from the starting pivot and ending
pivot.

Price moves on the vertical axis and time moves on the horizontal axis on a standard
bar chart. Therefore, vibration can be calculated as the gradient of the hypotenuse of a
right angled triangle using time as the base of the triangle and price as the height.

GANN ANGLES are simply VIBRATION ANGLES drawn at specific ratios of price
units per day, week, et cetera.

VIBRATION RATE = PRICE UNITS MOVED / TIME UNITS

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

For our purposes SPACE or VIBRATION ANGLES can be analyzed in
two ways.

° First as STATIC RATIOS, for instance a market vibration between two
pivots may calculate out to 0.333, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.667, 0.707, 1.000,
1.414, 1.500, 1.618, 1.732, 2.000, 2.236, 2.618 points per day, week or year.

If this were the case it would signal some form of geometricity between the two pivots.

° Secondly vibration angles can be compared DYNAMICALLY in the
same way as we would compare TIME or PRICE relationships between
trends of similar degree.

When two separate market vibration angles are compared to each other, for ratio
relationships, they are being measured DYNAMICALLY. Dynamic relationships are
far more important in the market structure than static relationships.

When it comes to making a trading judgement on a trend termination, before any con-
firmation signal is received, one needs to use TIME first, PRICE second and then
VIBRATION third. VIBRATION ANALYSIS will normally fill in the gaps when you
find it difficult to rationalize the market structure relative to only Time & Price.

The methods for analyzing VIBRATION are the same as we use for price analysis, ie.,

we can compare the vibration in consecutive waves and the vibration in the alternate
waves.

TIME & PRICE MEASURING TOOLS

GANN ANGLES (SPACE ANALYSIS)

GANN ANGLES ARE STATIC RATIO VIBRATION LINES. Their purpose is to
allow the analyst to keep track of price levels where the starting price is square in time.

A GANN ANGLE at say 1 unit of price to 1 unit of time is a simple static space or
vibration measurement. Gann teachings recommend analysts to monitor angles drawn
from highs and lows at rates of 0.25, 0.333, 0.500, 0.667, 1, 2, 4 and 8 price units per
day, week and month for a change of trend indication.

The real problem encountered by analysts is what represents 1 "degree" of price. In
some commodities and stocks 1 unit of price appears to be correct yet, ] have found
more times than not 1 "degree" of price is not 1 unit or anything like it.

Students of Gann often try to "curve fit" the chart scale so that a 45° angle represents
the 1 to 1 angle. They then use this angle as a support/resistance line. This is an ar-
bitary approach totally unsatisfactory for scientific analysis.

Contrary to popular teachings GANN ANGLES are not SUPPORT or RESISTANCE LINES,
merely a by product of the time and price relationships that manifest themselves
within market activity. Gann used angles as an easy way to keep a track of when time
could be squaring price. I can say this confidently because I have researched this tech-
nique extensively.

In defence of Gann’s teachings I can see that he used the 1 by 1 angle on many charts
as a trend indicator. For instance Gann would say that a market was in a strong trend
if it was trading above the 1 "degree" unit of price per day angle drawn off the last in-
termediate degree low or for that matter any significant reaction low in an uptrending
market. The same analysis can be applied in bear markets by drawing angles down
from highs.

With all this in mind analysts should be careful not to place to much importance on
"Gann angles" unless other relevant criteria such as COMPOSITE or DYNAMIC TIME
RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONVERGING AS THE PRICE ACTIVITY TRADES ONTO AN IMPOR-
TANT RATIO ANGLE.

The best way to use GANN ANGLES is as a confirmation that time and price is
"square" (falling on some ratio relationship), but only when the primary tools (Time
cycle ratios and price relationships) are signalling a possible change in trend.

The Deutsche Mark example on page 29 shows the bull trend terminating on a 0.0618
points per day vibration and the bear trend expiring on a 0.100 points per day vibra-
tion. Throughout each market trend the price activity traded above and below these
vibration angles, neither angle acting as support or resistance until the primary time
and price tools were signalling a reversal.

The example on page 28 shows future 1 x 1 vibrations of the 1st Square pinpointing
where time and price acted as resistance and Support. The angles into the future are a
dynamic projection of the time and price moved in the bull market.

With all the other tools available to analyze the market time and price accurately I
would never recommend the use of STATIC VIBRATION ANGLES only DYNAMIC
VIBRATION ANGLES as a guide to market position.

REVERSAL PATTERNS

REVERSAL PATTERNS

To successfully utilize the time and price analysis tools I have explained, as leading in-
dicators for possible change of trend, you will need to monitor the daily price activity
for confirmations that change is taking place.

If the daily chart patterns are a little cloudy then this analysis can be extended to week-
ly price activity.

As I explained in the previous chapter TIME ANALYSIS prepares us in advance for fu-
ture dates where change is possible.

PRICE RATIO ANALYSIS on the signal day confirms that the market structure is posi-
tioned for a change of trend.

PATTERN ANALYSIS will confirm that a change of trend is taking place when the
proper time and price signals are present.

REVERSAL PATTERNS to monitor for a possible change of trend are simple forma-
tions. They are only relative to the short term price activity. By keeping the pattern
analysis simple you can make sure you don’t complicate the trading decision process.

The primary price patterns to consider as a possible confirmation for change of trend
are:-

° REVERSAL DAY

° KEY REVERSAL DAY

° OUTSIDE REVERSAL DAY
° DOUBLE & TRIPLE TOPS
° DOUBLE BOTTOMS

These patterns are easy to recognize when viewed on a BAR CHART.

Reversal patterns can occur at any time in normal market activity, nevertheless they
are far more important when a market makes an extreme intraday high or low price
after a prolonged bull or bear market trend.

If you are going to trade a time and price signal at the exact reversal of trend it is ad-
visable to make sure you can identity one of these patterns prior to the close of the
day. If the pattern is present you will certainly have at least a 75% chance of being cor-
rect.

Japanese Candlestick charts are now becoming popular so J will illustrate each pattern
I consider important in both the conventional bar chart formation and the Japanese
Candlestick formation.

REVERSAL DAY

The REVERSAL DAY PATTERN is the most common reversal pattern known to
technical traders.

BULL MARKET REVERSAL DAY

The market OPENS at or above the CLOSING PRICE of the Previous day, then
trades to a new intraday high (the pivot) in the prevailing trend. The selling pressure
after the high of the day causes the market to close at or below the OPENING PRICE
of that day. Depending on the position of the close relative to the high for the day or
the previous days close the more weighting one can assume to the pattern.

The stronger the reversal pattern on a TIME & PRICE SIGNAL DAY the greater the
opportunity is to enter the market immediately with a stop loss above or below the
pivot point from which the trend is reversing. If your time and price analysis is correct
your stop will only get hit in the advent of an irregular top or bottom. An irregular top
or bottom may penetrate the signal day by a few ticks in the case of a double bottom
or a double top. You will get clear warning beforehand if the price activity in the next
few days fails to advance the market away from the signal day pivot.

35
REVERSAL PATTERNS

OUTSIDE REVERSAL DAY

An outside reversal day is an excellent indication that the current trend is in real
trouble.

An outside day simp! means that the HIGH / LOW RANGE for the day was
GREATER AND UTSIDE the range for the day before. An inside day occurs when
the high /low range for the day is inside the range of the previous day. Basically an out-
side day is an indication of market volatility. The buyers and the sellers can’t agree on
what is a fair price.

Any reversal indication on an outside day coinciding with TIME & PRICE SIGNALS
is an excellent LEADING INDICATION FOR A REVERSAL OF TREND.

REVERSAL PATTERNS

DOUBLE & TRIPLE TOPS - DOUBLE BOTTOMS

Double tops and double bottoms are seen to occur in markets on a regular basis.
When they do they create a feeling of uncertainty in regards a change of trend. I have
noticed that double tops or bottoms occur more frequently when the PRICE activity
has reached a strong RESISTANCE or SUPPORT LEVEL prior to the TIME SIG-
NALS reaching maturity.

Double or triple tops and bottoms can be formed over a period of up to two weeks.
When they occur on strong price relationships such as price retracements Or expan-
sions of previous ranges you will find that the market is marching time waiting tor the
TIME CYCLE RATIOS to expire.

During the double or triple topping or bottoming process it’s unlikely that you will get
a clear indication of a REVE DAY PATTERN. This can be a little unnerving
especially when you see every other indicator pointing to a change of trend.

Always be alert for a FAILURE to CONFIRM an ongoing trend either by a REVER-
SAL PATTERN COINCIDING WITH THE DOUBLE TOP OR BOTTOM or on the
next days trading the market opens ina WEAK POSITION RELATIVE TO THE
PREVIOUS DAY. Always ensure that IMPORTANT TIME & PRICE SIGNALS
were present on one of the double tops or bottoms before making a trade in the op-
posite direction.

When analyzing PATTERN a little logic and COMMON SENSE goes a long way. Just
the same whenever you take a trade at the extreme danger point, 1e., the high or low
pivot day or the day after, make sure that you place a stop loss just above or below the
extreme pivot day from which you are basing your decision to trade.

37
REVERSAL PATTERNS

NON CONFIRMATION PATTERN DAYS

Probably 50% of the time market trend reversals will begin from a PATTERN dis-
similar to those mentioned here. This will not negate the importance of the TIME &
PRICE SIGNALS, it will only delay your entry into the new trend. When cases like
this cause you to hold back you can use two other simple entry rules.

After a market appears to have terminated a reasonably long trend without providing a
set up reversal signal - look for two or three days where, in a bull market lower highs
are made on a break of the uptrend or in a bear market higher lows are made on a
break of the downtrend.

Contemplate a Sell when - The market makes two consecutive lower highs after a bull
market high, especially if the uptrend line is penetrated.

Contemplate a Buy when - The market makes two consecutive higher lows after a bear
market low, especially if the downtrend line is penetrated.

If you enter a trade based on these criteria your trading stop loss must be placed above
or below the PPVOT DAY EXTREME POINT.

Minor degree trend reversals should proceed in most cases for between a week and
three weeks.

Intermediate degree trend reversals should unfold in at least three minor waves over
periods of four and up to thirteen weeks, sometime longer.

If you identify a market reversal correctly it should be possible to trade the unfolding
move for at least two weeks, often longer, without any fear of losing money.

TREND ANALYSIS

TREND ANALYSIS

Trend analysis is of primary importance if one is to become and remain a successful
trader.

Without a proper understanding of how to recognize a trend, or how to recognize

when a trend is overbought or oversold, or how to recognize when the momentum of a
trend is drying up ou will find it difficult to interpret your TIME, PRICE and PAT-
TERN ANALY 18.

Basically I see TREND ANALYSIS as a study of "weighting the probability of the
market forces either continuing in the same direction or reversing direction".

Most trend indicators available to technical analysts basically do the same thing, some
faster or slower than others.

When your TREND ANALYSIS INDICATORS support your TIME, PRICE and
PATTERN ANALYSIS you will be 90% certain about the market position. This may
only occur about 30% of the time, but that is enough to pick out the trading set ups.

I don’t see any reason to use more than four or five indicators for my TREND
ANALYSIS.

The indicators I use predominately are designed to work together in a way that will
cover most market contingencies, especially when it comes to evaluating trend.

These are:-

e CYCLETRADER TREND WAVES

° 10 DAY RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX

° 10 & 20 DAY MOVING AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICE
e HIGHER LOWS - LOWER HIGHS

° TREND LINES

TREND ANALYSIS

CYCLETRADER TREND WAVES

These are the same TREND WAVES I originally developed and programmed into the
WAVETRADER SOFTWARE 7 years ago.

The trend wave study has proven to be a most reliable indicator of trend, not only for
holding a trend but also for alerting one to an imminent reversal of trend. I have even
noticed that the peaks and troughs of the trend waves can sometimes be predicted
using the same timing tools I use on the price charts.

The TREND WAVES are a mathematical calculation which takes into account the
price differentials from one day to the next over 10 days, these numbers are then ex-
ponentially manipulated to produce a daily value. The sample needs 150 days before
accurate smoothing begins. The continuing daily calculation produces a value either
above or below zero. A line chart of this value is representative of the markets
VELOCITY, MOMENTUM and ACELLERATION.

TREND WAVES are adjusted for wave degree in the same way as a moving average.
° SLOW

e MEDIUM

e FAST

The important points are these:-

Calculations produce a value either ABOVE or BELOW zero.
e Values above ZERO are relative degree BULLISH indications.
e Values below ZERO are relative degree BEARISH indications.

Daily direction of the index is either UP or DOWN.
° The UP direction indicates underlying market STRENGTH.
e The DOWN direction indicates underlying market WEAKNESS.

The SLOW WAVE has excellent characteristics in a trending market, it is weighted to
keep you on track right up until the last wave of INTERMEDIATE DEGREE has
been exhausted.

The MEDIUM WAVE should be diverging with the price activity prior to an impor-
tant market reversal.

The FAST WAVE should follow every MINOR degree impulse and act once again as
an early warning signal for a change in trend.

A markets momentum is at full strength when all trend waves are clearly going in the
same direction, ie., either UP or DOWN. It is advisable never to take a trade against
this signal.

Below I am only illustrating the FAST and SLOW TREND WAVES. The MEDIUM

market volatility.

TREND ANALYSIS

RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX (10 DAY)

The relative strength index basically evaluates the position of the latest closing price
relative to previous closing prices in the time period of the index.

The RSI evaluates its readings between 0-100. Readings above 80 are bordering on the
overbought zone. Readings below 20 are bordering on the oversold zone.

Overbought and oversold readings prepare you for a possible reaction to trend.

In an extended bull market it is possible to register OVERBOUGHT readings for
weeks on end. Eventually the final high will be made when the RSI fails to read higher
than it did on the "Elliott 3rd wave pivot". The same proposition can be used in reverse
for bear markets.

The benefit I find with this index is that it keeps you alert to the overall momentum
within market trends.

When you see that the momentum of a market is declining, even when the price trades
to new highs or lows, you are aware that a change of trend is possible in the near fu-
ture. With this in mind you can evaluate the TIME SIGNALS close at hand to predict
when the change will occur. All you need then is PRICE and PATTERN confirmation
to make a trade when the change occurs.

MOVING AVERAGES (10 and 20 day)

There’s nothing new about moving averages, they have been around forever, I remem-
ber when I first started using them and thought they were the best thing available. I
still use them as a guide to make sure I stay in touch with reality.

A moving average is calculated by adding together the last ? number of days closing
prices and dividing them by the ? number of days.

The faster (less number of days) the average is made up of will allow it to adjust more
quickly with the day to day activity. A 10 day average is going to follow the market ac-
tivity much more closely than a 20 day average.

How to use them effectively:-

The market is in a strong trending position when the crossovers are in line with the
market direction and the price is above (bull trend) or below (bear trend) the 20 day
moving average.

The market is in a strong trending position whilst the averages are separating. Change
is occurring when they appear to be converging.

They will always be behind the current market activity so you need to evaluate TIME,
PRICE & PATTERN and second guess what they may do in the future as a change in
trend takes place. Once the trend is confirmed these indicators will encourage you to

stay on the trade, especially if they continue to hang in the right place.

HIGHER LOWS - LOWER HIGHS

To some this "indicator" may sound simplistic. It is not at all because it is the market
talking to you.

Just by looking at a price chart you can see if the wave formations are making higher
lows or lower highs.

HIGHER LOWS together with higher highs are signs of a bullish market.
LOWER HIGHS together with lower lows are signs of a bearish market.

These observations can be applied to MINOR degree, INTERMEDIATE degree and
PRIMARY degree wave formations.

From a trading point of view the day to day patterns will confirm a trend is intact. For

a longer-term perspective the primary and intermediate degree waves will confirm if a
BULL or BEAR market is intact.

Another point worth mentioning for determining trends of larger degree such as the ex-
ample below. Monitor the IMPULSE WAVES, ie., the waves which move fast in one
direction. The gold market has experienced very fast declines on all the down moves
between 1990 and 1992. The bear market will not be over until the declines become or-
derly corrections rather than explosive declines.

TREND LINES

Trend lines are the most commonest tool used by people who keep charts. In the short
term they are very effective in recognizing overbalancing of price. In the larger degree
they provide a clear perspective of the gradient of trend.

Often when a market trades back to an existing trend line and reverses direction the
rice level will coincide with a PRICE RETRACEMENT SIGNAL. If it does and

; ME SIGNALS of similar degree are present you will find it one of the safest entry
evels to trade.

When a market has reversed trend on TIME, PRICE, PATTERN and TREND signals
you will et 2 gontitmation in the degree of trend change by the breaking of the

TREND LINES are guidelines to formulate rules around. They keep waves of similar
degree in perspective.

TREND INDICATOR SUMMARY

Indicators aae MATHEMATICAL MANIPULATIONS of past price data, they supply
valuable information after the fact. They are not some “holy grail" for generating buy
and sell signals. On their own they can be dangerous in the hands of a novice market
analyst.

Trend indicators are a valuable tool for the analyst who wishes to take a holistic view
of the market.

Trend indicators should always be used to confirm that market conditions are in agree-
ment with your LEADING TECHNICAL INDICATORS.

TREND ANALYSIS is a prerequisite for trading profits. If you don’t like the in-
dicators I use, find some that you can have faith in and refer to them regularly.

ELLIOTT WAVE

ELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS

No technical manual relating to the ANALYSIS OF TIME & PRICE activity in markets
would be complete unless it addressed the contribution made by RALPH N. ELLIOTT
to the logical analysis of market structure.

ELLIOTT WAVE IS A DISCIPLINE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOL-
OGY OF THE CROWD AND THE CROWD BEHAVIOR PATTERNS.

ELLIOTT WAVE ACTS AS A SUPERB TREND INDICATOR. AS WAVES OF SIMILAR DEGREE
UNFOLD THE ELLIOTT COUNT ALERTS YOU TO THE POTENTIAL REVERSALS IN TREND.

ELLIOTT WAVE COUNTING CAN KEEP YOU ON THE TREND RIGHT UP UNTIL ITS CON-
CLUSION.

ELLIOTT WAVE COUNTING GIVES YOU A BASIS FROM WHICH TO MAKE EDUCATED
FORECASTS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE MARKET ACTIVITY.

My studies of Elliott’s thesis have found some very reliable price patterns that com-_
bine well in practice. I don’t really care about complicating issues by labeling waves in
the complicated counts popularized by some famous promoters of the ELLIOTT
WAVE PRINCIPLE. I am only interested in what works with trading!

The ELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE was first released as a predictive analysis tool
directly relating to the US stock market. Although Elliott designed and illustrated his
thesis using the US stock market indices, many of Elliott’s tenets can be applied to any
free trading market.

The benefit I find in having a working knowledge of ELLIOTT WAVE is that it helps
you plan ahead. If you understand the main points of the Elliott Wave Principle it will
elp you recognize the potential and magnitude in any market trend.

Elliott Wave contains some strict rules about how the market should react under given
circumstances. When a market breaks the rules you have a clear cut signal to "change
your thinking around" and go with the new trend.

From a traders point of view Elliott Wave should not be considered as anything more
than a TREND INDICATOR. When it’s going according to the book its great, when
it’s not you don’t have to worry about it because you have TIME, PRICE, PATTERN
& TREND to fall back on.

47
ELLIOTT WAVE

ELLIOTT WAVE INTERPRETATION

The best warning I can give anyone who is new to Elliott Wave is that out of the 10
best "Elliotticians" I have met only about 50% of them seem to agree on a particular
Elliott wave count at anyone time.

This is due to the fact they mainly insist on fitting the current market position into con-
text with the market position of 10 or 20 years ago. Some even wish to relate today’s
market with those of 50 years ago. The real problem is they are often trying to force
their own will on the market in progress rather than use the market to tell them what
is about to happen next.

With many market situations it often takes several weeks or months to pass before one
can establish what was indeed the theoretical Elliott wave count. In the mean time
trading opportunity has passed and the bank account has been depleted by more expen-
ses.

For trading purposes it is not necessary (0 worry about the Elliott Wave count for
more than the current PRIMARY TREND. To do so only complicates the issue.

When the TIME and PRICE setups present themselves it’s nice to be able to identify
that a clear cut Elliott Wave Pattern has been unfolding or has possibly unfolded.

Elliott Wave, like all good technical indicators has its good features. If you can learn to
use the good features your ability to SECOND GUESS THE FUTURE MARKET WILL BE
ENHANCED.

Never place yourself in a position where you rely totally on your opinion of the EL-
LIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE for your livelihood. The chances you will be right are at
best 50/50.

Elliott Wave has been responsible for some of the best market calls in history, never-
theless I have also seen the best exponents of this theory stay on the wrong side of the
market for years on end.

ELLIOTT WAVE COUNTING

To keep track of the stages that a bull or bear market moves through, Ralph Nelson El-
liott developed a labeling system to keep track of the unfolding waves of trend.

Waves are broken down into stages or degree :-

° CYCLE I, I, WL, IV, V

° PRIMARY [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] - [A], [B], [C]

. INTERMEDIATE (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) - (A), (B), (C)
° MINOR 1, 2,3,4,5-A,B,C

° MINUTE i, ii, iii, iv, v-a, b,c

The principal points are these :-

e dhe same rinciple applies to all waves be they MINUTE DEGREE or
CLE DEGREE.

e Waves are categorized as either IMPULSIVE or CORRECTIVE.

° IMPULSE WAVES have a minimum 5 legs and sometimes up to 11.

° CORRECTIONS have a minimum 3 legs and sometimes 7.

A minute wave structure when completed fulfills a completed stage of a minor wave.
A minor wave structure when completed fulfills a completed Intermediate wave.

As each stage of degree unfolds the same principle is applied, right up to and including
CYCLE WAVES. . P P PP emer

In an expansion 5-11 minute waves will make up a minor impulse wave. In a correction
3-7 minute waves will complete a minor corrective wave. Generally for simplification it
is accepted that expansions contain 5 waves and corrections 3 waves.

Expansions are labeled in degrees using numbers and numerals. i, 1, (1), [2], I

Corrections are labeled in degrees using letters. a, A, (A), [A]

ELLIOTT WAVE STRUCTURE

Structures unfold in a labeling pattern like this :-

BULL MARKET COUNT

Minor 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = Intermediate (1)
Minor A, B, C = Intermediate (2)
Minor 1, 2,3 ,4,5 = Intermediate (3)
Minor A, B, C = Intermediate (4)
Minor 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = Intermediate (5)
Intermediate (0-5) = Primary [1]

Wave [2] and [4] unfold as corrective waves in an (A), (B), (C).

Wave [3] and [5] unfold as impulse waves similar to wave [1].

BEAR MARKET COUNT

After every bull market you can expect a bear market to unfold to balance the cycles
before another bull market begins. The bear market can be either a larger degree cor-
rection [A], [B], [C] to the previous bull market or a fully fledged decline which takes
on the appearance of a bull market in reverse [-1], [-2], (3), [-4], [-5].

ELLIOTT WAVE CHARACTERISTICS

WAVE 1 - IMPULSE - 1st SIGN OF A NEW BULL MARKET

Wave 1 will be either a slow basing type movement as accumulation takes place from
the previous downtrend, or a dynamic thrust caused by the large number of short
traders covering positions in an oversold market.

The first sign of the new bull market.is when the advance in progress overbalances the
price rises in the previous bear market rallies. Any penetration of the major downtrend
ine or a retracement in excess of 38.2% of the previous bear market is generally a sign
that a new bull trend is in the making.

WAVE 2 - CORRECTION - ORDERLY DECLINE

Second waves often appear to be part of the previous bear phase as they often retrace
much, if not all of the first wave up. They are not inspiring moves to create the atmos-
phere for a new bull market. Wave 2 will generally retrace 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%
or 100% of the wave 1 advance. Any retracement less than 50% will indicate a fast
moving trend is in progress, eg., 0.333, 0.354, 0.382, 0.447 and 0.500.

A careful study of corrective wave structures is recommended, for correctly identifying
and confirming a wave 2 bottom is the best way to enter profitable medium term
trends. The wave 3 will always be a clear cut bullish impulse move.

WAVE 3 - IMPULSE - EXPANSION WITH MINOR CORRECTIONS

Third waves are often long and broad. The trend is unmistakable. Fundamental news is
entering the market and instilling confidence in the future. As the third wave progres-
ses market sentiment will be so high one would think there will never be an end to the
current trend. Third waves are the best waves to identify and trade for the long haul.
Minor corrections are often very shallow affairs as the move really gets going.

Third waves in simple terms usually advance to the 161.8% level of the wave one ad-
vance, either measured from the wave 2 low or the wave one high as a projection. A
61.8% projected increase of the wave 1 advance is a minimum target.

Wave 3 targets based on wave one projections should be 61.8% then 100%, 161.8%,
200%, 223.6%, 261.8%, 423.6%.

51
ELLIOTT WAVE

WAVE 4 - CORRECTION - USUALLY BEGINS FROM AN OVERBOUGHT
BULL MARKET

Fourth waves are predictable in as much as they see the sentiment turn from one of
hope to one of despair. The bullish consensus index will fall to the lowest readings
seen for months. Soothsayers and many chartists will be predicting the end of the bull
market and further falls as the wave 4 terminates. "Johnny come latelys" to the market
will be in a state of nervousness. The public have usually entered at the late stages of
the third wave.

Fourth waves often take on a triangular appearance due to the fight backwards and for-
wards between the longer term trend and the frightened speculators. A word of warn-
ing regards the count in a 4th wave is this. Sometimes wave one of wave 5 will double
bottom with the wave 4 low, this gives the appearance that it is part of the fourth wave
structure; this can often leave you a wave short when you reach the wave 5 termina-
tion. This situation can be disastrous when you believe a market has one more upswing
to complete a valid Elliott 5 wave count.

Fourth waves usually retrace 14.6%, 23.6% or 38.2% of the range advanced during the
total bull market. Often a wave 4 will terminate at the 38.2% retracement of the wave

If wave 4 retraces more than 38.2% of wave 3 or the total bull market range, wave 5
will often result in a failure. A wave 5 failure occurs when the advance fails to trade
above the wave 3 high.

Whenever you identify a triangular formation it is nearly always signaling a base for
one more advance. This is the distribution phase catching all the latecomers. Once a
fifth wave breaks above the third wave high even the traders who exited through the
distribution phase are attracted back into the market.

WAVE 5 - FIFTH WAVES - THE END OF THE BULL MARKET
Fifth waves can be either dynamic, mild or failures.

Primary fifth waves can fail to reach the high point of the third primary wave, this will
be signaled only when a clear five wave count of minor degree in the wave 5 can be
identified. This event is more common if the primary wave three contains an extended
fifth intermediate wave and the market made a deep panic correction in the fourth
wave.

Once a fifth wave breaks above the previous third wave top the fundamentals will be
changing yet the market is not listening. Human nature will keep the majority buying
the market as greed becomes more apparent. No one will be predicting the top, quite
the contrary, the "experts" will now be advocating the market is headed for even more
ridiculous highs.

At the top of a bull market no one will listen to sensible advice when it comes to in-
vestments. The bullish consensus index will be at an all time high, the public will be
fully invested, the commercials (smart money) will be distributing as much as they can.
Volume will be declining as everyone becomes fully invested.

Wave five targets based on projections of the total advance to wave three should be
61.8% then 100%, 161.8%, 200%, 261.8%, 423.6%.

On many occasions a bull market will terminate when the wave 5 relationship to the

total bull market is 0.382, 0.500 or 0.618. What this means is that wave 4 terminates on
the 0.618, 0.500 or the 0.382 division of the total bull market range.

NEWS CORPORATION LIMITED - BULL MARKET 1984 /1987

This long-term bull market illustration shows how bull markets can start off slowl and
progressively increase in strength as the public becomes more aware of the bullis
trend in stocks.

Generally in any LONG-TERM BULL MARKET there will be several deviations
from the theoretical Elliott Wave ideal.

In this case an EXTENSION WAVE FORMATION unfolded in the wave [5]. Exten-
sions can occur in any impulse wave, ie., wave 1, 3 or 5. Extensions can be dealt with
by labeling the unfolding waves in the same degree and counting up to [7], [9] or [11]
waves for a final bull market count.

When you get an extension in wave 5 of a bull market expansion you will more often
than not see all the gains in the extension lost in the first wave of the new bear market.

I recommend you read the ELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE by Frost and Prechter, this
book is considered the bible on Elliott Wave and illustrates all of the market
anomalies that can occur within the guidelines of Elliott Wave. It will pay you to re-

read this book from time to time until you really understand how to label waves in
your own style.

BEAR MARKET CHARACTERISTICS

WAVE AOR 1 OF THE NEW BEAR MARKET

A waves are usually viewed as corrections to an overheated market, they are generally
short and swift, it depends upon the volume of trading that takes place to determine
the amount of panic they create.

The A wave will generally terminate below the last wave 4 low, this is normally a confir-
mation for the new bear market. At the conclusion of the wave A the regulatory
authorities, the media and all the "experts" will produce excuses for the sudden fall. If

a crash wave follows a bull market high you can be fairly sure the rot has set in. If a
crash wave follows an extension in a third wave and only retraces the length of the ex-
tension you can often find that a wave 5 will unfold as a completely new bull market.

Wave A targets when a dynamic reversal takes place after a clear cut 5 wave bull
market are 33.3 and 50% retracement of the total advance in the bull market, some-
times crash waves retrace 61.8% of the total gains.

WAVE B OR 2 IN THE NEW BEAR MARKET

After the initial A wave washout a rally must take place before the bear market can
continue. Often when the retracement progresses it will seem to the casual observer
that all is well. [FAR FROM IT]

The more severe the first wave decline is in a new bear market trend then the slower
the recovery will be.

Wave B begins as a short covering rally and could also contain fresh buying by the
traders who now believe prices are back to a reasonable level. The attitude is that
things have been over done and the would be bargain hunters come out of the wood-
work.

Most major B waves often become triangular in appearance as the people caught by
the fall slowly unload positions on the rallies.

Often as B waves are nearing completion the sentiment will become more bullish than
it was at the top of the preceding bull market top.

B Waves are erratic in formation, ie., they do not take on the appearance of impulse
waves in a bull market.

Normally Wave B targets should be a 50%, 57.7%, 66.7%, 70.7%, 87.5% even 100%
retracement of the wave A decline.

54
ELLIOTT WAVE

WAVE C OR WAVE 3 IN A BEAR MARKET

Wave C can be explosive or progressive as with a wave 5, C waves will more often
than not sub-divide into 5 wave structures.

C waves in a prolonged bear market normally start off slowly and build up as the fun-
damental news turns from bad to worse (similar in the reverse to third waves of a bull
market). Media attention turns the sentiment around from hope to one of despair,
forced selling’s to pay back loans accentuate the fall in prices.

Bear market termination targets are calculated by projecting the Wave A down in
ratios of 61.8%, 100%, 141.2% or 161.8%. or subtracting similar ratios of the points
lost in the A wave from the B wave high.

Total value lost in a bear market will sometimes correspond to a ratio discount from
the bull market high, ie., total percentage value lost in a bear market could be 33.3%,
38.2%, 50%, 57.7%, 61.8%, 66.7%, 70.7% and as much as 90%.

A bear market will only cease when at least 80% of the market participants believe
that further falls are going to occur. The crowd behavior will be your best guide when
ratios of time and price are present to fulfill the tenets of market geometry.

ELLIOTT WAVE

ELLIOTT WAVE STRICT RULES FOR DAY TO DAY USE

A WAVE is the distance between two adjacent progress labels "of the same degree".
As a general rule markets will advance in five waves and contract in three waves.

Impulse waves have a minimum of five waves and the corrective waves have a mini-
mum of three waves.

In a bull move there will be three impulse waves up, interrupted by two corrective
waves down.

In a bear move there will be two impulse waves down, interrupted by one corrective
wave up.

Overall trend is established by the direction (up or down) of the waves containing five
leg sequences.

The pattern of corrective waves in an impulse bull market five wave sequence normal-
ly alternate. This means that a simple correction will be followed by a complex correc-
tion and vice versa.

A simple correction is an (a,b,c) three wave movement. A complex correction normally
contains 5 movements (a,b,c,d,e). Complex corrections form patterns of triangular ap-
pearance on a price chart.

Wave 3 highs in a bull trend should be accompanied by overbought readings from
momentum indicators.

Triangles are far more common in fourth waves.

Wave four corrections will more often than not terminate within the area of the pre-
vious wave four of lesser degree.

The third wave in a five wave sequence is usually the longest wave, but never the
shortest.

Wave four in a five wave sequence should not overlap wave one except within diagonal
triangles. Diagonal triangles are more common in Minor degree waves.

Extensions can only occur in impulse waves, and are very common, extensions are
more likely to occur in third and fifth waves.

Extensions in fifth waves are often retraced twice. Usually the first retracement is fast
and in many cases will result in a crash wave.

Primary degree bear markets will nearly always retrace 50% or more of the gains
made in the corresponding bull market.

ELLIOTT WAVE PATTERNS

When you look at a bar chart what do you see? Only what you’ve been trained to see.
Wave patterns are a direct reflection of the crowd psychology.

Wave patterns repeat over time so it is important we learn to recognize the patterns
and the possible consequences implied by the patterns.

"All ELLIOTT WAVE patterns imply certain levels of strength or weakness. When a
pattern completes, the market must react in a fashion which is consistent with the im-
plications of that pattern.", Glenn Neely - MASTERING ELLIOTT WAVE.

CORRECTIONS

The first step when it comes to identifying profitable trading opportunities is in being
able to differentiate between a market correction and an impulse wave. Market correc-
tions allow you to plan a low risk entry for the next impulse move. Once you have a
position the character of the corrections will alert you to the possible termination of
the trend in progress.

SELL STRENGTH - BUY WEAKNESS

In a bull market correction (A, B, C) the termination of the A wave is weakness, the
termination of the B wave is strength and the completed C wave is weakness.

In a bear market correction (A, B, C) the termination of the A wave is strength, the
termination of the B wave is weakness and the completed C wave is strength.

SIMPLE CORRECTIONS
Elliott terminology - ZIG ZAG - ordinary strength.

The B wave is usually 50%, 61.8%, 66.7% or 70.7% of wave A. The C wave will ter-
minate on a retracement level of the prior waves of similar degree.

ei

ZIG ZAG

57
ELLIOTT WAVE

Simple corrections are more likely to occur in the earlier stages of a trend. As a trend
progresses the activity of the crowd combines to produce more complex patterns in the
corrections.

My favorite pattern is the TRIANGLE. Triangles are more likely to occur in fourth
waves, especially when the wave 3 has been a very strong move.. The beauty about
recognizing a TRIANGLE after a wave 3 is that you know exactly where you are in the
trend. This should allow you to pick the exact top of the 5th wave.

This example is absolutely text book Elliott wave. Wave 2 unfolded as a 0.786 price
retracement of wave 1. Wave 4 unfolded in a symmetrical triangle. Wave v of 5 ter-
minated as a diagonal triangle.

58
ELLIOTT WAVE

DIAGONAL TRIANGLES

Diagonal triangles are more likely to form as a trend is exhausting itself. Diagonal tri-
angles occur in five wave structures.

Whenever you identify a DIAGONAL wave structure you should be alert for a major
reversal of trend.

Make sure you identify that a wave 3 and 4 have occurred prior to the diagonal tri-
angle formation if you are going to trade the reversal of trend.

The diagonal triangle should expire on major TIME CYCLE VIBRATIONS of the un-
folding wave series.

WAVE [4] - 38.2% RETRACEMENT OF TOTAL BULL MARKET TERMINATING
IN THE AREA OF THE 4th WAVE OF LESSER DEGREE.

This situation may not occur very often but if it does this example could alert you to a
"Trading set up" from which you can retire. If you look closely at the wave [2] and [4]
ou can see that neither closely follows the simple rules associated with Elliott Wave.
e ratios nevertheless are your best guide to a reversal of trend in 4th waves of this
nature.

The ensuing wave (1) of 5 waves and the wave (2) of three waves gave the most defini-
tive confirmation that this Elliott wave count was the correct one.

38.2% retracements are more common in 4th waves than any other ratio.

WAVE PATTERNS ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING

Due to the constant stream of new participants entering and the constant stream of
losers exiting a market the price patterns will be in constant variation. The three pat-
terns explained so far are the ones I find most useful for trading. These are the SYM-
METRICAL TRIANGLE, the ZIG ZAG and the DIAGONAL TRIANGLE.

In addition to these patterns we can have formations falling into the following
categories.

The best explanation for the successful analysis of these patterns is provided for in the

HEAD AND SHOULDERS PATTERN

A head and shoulders is formed from the 3rd wave high (left shoulder), 5th wave high
(head) of the bull market and the B wave or wave 2 high (right shoulder) of the new
bear market. From the 4th wave low and the A wave or wave 1 low we can draw in the
neckline. Once the neckline is broken the wave 3 of the new bear market is confirmed.

IRREGULAR CORRECTIONS

Possibly one of the most important ELLIOTT PATTERNS to become familiar with is
the IRREGULAR CORRECTION.

An IRREGULAR CORRECTION normally occurs in an A, B, C formation where the
B wave leg exceeds the level of the starting point of the wave A.

I have found that the most common place where irregular corrections occur is at the
end of bull markets and in the first minor wave 2 of a new bull market. I also watch for
irregular wave 2’s as the fifth wave in a bull market is beginning. It’s not nice to end
up at the top of a market expansion and your Elliott count is two waves short, especial-
ly when you have every other indicator signaling the trend is finished. Once the C wave
begins you don’t get much of a chance to sell the market.

When a market makes an irregular correction you will need to identify it if you are to
keep your Elliott Wave Count on the right track. Generally speaking most Elliotticians
differ in their wave counts because they interpret irregular wave patterns quite dif-
ferently to each other. Some don’t believe that the wave 2 in a bull market can overlap
the starting point. This is one of the traps associated with text book Elliott Wave, I
believe that the DJIA 570 low in December 1974 was a minor wave 2. The true low
was in October, 1974 when the S&P 500 made low.

Often at the conclusion of a bull market the B wave will reach the ideal price level es-
timated for the wave 5. When the wave 2 of a new bull market exceeds the price level
of the 0 low point, the level should coincide with a price retracement level of larger de-
gree expected to act as support in the previous bear market trend.

ELLIOTT WAVE AND TREND INDICATORS

One of the surest ways to clear up the complexity in wave formations experienced
from time to time is through the use of a reliable trend indicator.

The one I prefer most is the RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX brought to prominence
Bb J Welles Wilder Jr., in his book NEW CONCEPTS IN TECHNICAL TRADING

Elliott wave 3’s often unfold as explosive moves compared with other wave formations;
wave 3’s almost always terminate when the market is either OVERBOUGHT in a bull
market and OVERSOLD in a bear market.

The RSI registers OVERBOUGHT and OVERSOLD readings and the DIVER-
GENCE between price activity and market MOMENTUM when the trend terminates
at the wave 5 apex.

When my opinion of the ELLIOTT WAVE COUNT is in doubt all I do is try and lo-
cate the Wave 3 apex and then work the count backwards and forwards from there. I
always keep my counts simple and rarely get involved in trying to break every small
wave series into a text book wave count.

Wave C’s of [A] waves often terminate in an OVERSOLD market position, but C
waves of [B] waves nearly always register OVERBOUGHT readings on the RSI. Wave
> in a [C] wave will be the apex which registers the lowest OVERSOLD signal on the

DEFINING ELLIOTT WAVE APEX POINTS

If you wish to reduce ELLIOTT WAVE to a simplistic form then the best way is to _
take the view that every minor, intermediate and major apex point in the price activity
holds some significance to the theory. Sometimes when you remove the time perspec-
tive between swing highs and lows the wave form looks more like the TEXT BOOK
EXAMPLES. This same approach can be seen by analysts who use POINT AND
FIGURE charting techniques.

The best approach I have found is to simply apply a percentage change rule to the
price structure.

Each price series requires its own % swing value to pick out the important swings and
afign them to the theory. As a general rule Minor swings move in swings of between 2-
7%, Intermediate degree swings move somewhere between 7-15% minimum, and
Major degree swings rise or decline between 15% and 50% of their prior swing high or
ow price.

What I do on a day to day basis is examine every new swing high and low with the past
swing highs and lows for time and price relationships. I can do this on a semi-
automatic basis using percentage swing theory.

% change swing theory was first used by H.M. GARTLEY to illustrate his own wave
theories. I recommend Gartley’s book PROFITS IN THE STOCK MARKET first
published in 1935 as a standard to have in any technical analysts library.

ELLIOTT WAVE PERSPECTIVE IN THE REAL WORLD.....

ELLIOTT WAVE

ELLIOTT’s MOST IMPORTANT REVELATION

Ralph N. Elliott was the first technical analysis pioneer I know of to actually come for-
ward in print with the following statement. "MARKET BEHAVIOR FOLLOWS THE
NATU LAW OF THE UNIVERSE".

NATURAL LAW is the mathematical equation which governs the relationship be-
tween MUSICAL TONES, PLANETARY CYCLES, GROWTH PATTERNS IN
PLANTS & MARINE CREATURES, ACTION and REACTION, GROWTH and
DECLINE, IMPULSE and CONTRACTION.

Elliott’s major contribution to market analysis in my eyes was his revelation that
each WAVE OF SIMILAR DEGREE must relate in both TIME and PRICE
AMPLITUDE.

Elliott’s followers seem to be more concerned with price units within waves of similar
degree. I wish It were possible to speak to Elliott himself, so I could find out from the
man how he actually formulated his theory on TIME relationships within market
trends.

Unfortunately ELLIOTT’S thesis was incomplete. All of his theories were con-
centrated around the FIBONACCI SERIES of RATIOS and NUMBERS.

His thesis seems to have focused only on the ratios of the GEOMETRIC PROGRES-
SION, ie., 0.382, 0.618, 1.000, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236, 6.854, et cetera.

Also from Elliott’s writings it seems as if he was only concerned with TIME PERIODS
of market trends which expired on counts in time, either days, weeks or years which
coincided with the FIBONACCI SERIES, ie., 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377,
610, 987, et cetera. It may be he was more knowledgeable than this although little in-
formation exists to suggests otherwise.

In terms of TIME COUNTING Elliott’s contributions sowed a seed for me to research
and expand upon. If it had not been for Ralph N. Elliott’s contribution I don’t think I
would have had the patience to spend the hours I have researching the HARMONIC
RELATIONSHIPS OF TIME AND PRICE.

If Ralph N. Elliott had had the computer systems we are blessed with today his dis-
coveries would have been exponential to his published material. When one combines
the teachings of William D. Gann with Elliott’s we don’t know the extent of the wealth
we have inherited. Jointly both men re-discovered a base of knowledge which is so su-
perior to anything else put forward this century, by any other pioneer of technical
methods.

Elliott and others who have researched the structure of markets can honestly tell you,
all other mathematical manipulations of market data practiced today can only be FIL-
TERED when one has the knowledge of TIME and PRICE relationships which
manifest themselves within the affairs of man.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS relat

All cycles or
CYCLES

Market Cycles are not of fixed length; They are dynamic.
Dynamic means they are interactive, ie., they expand and contract over time.

Market cycles are directly related to the behavior patterns of individuals
acting on masse.

UNDERLYING THE HUMAN ELEMENT WE HAVE :-

° FUNDAMENTAL CYCLES
e NATURAL CYCLES (SEASONAL)
° PLANETARY CYCLES

It is important to be aware of the individual cycles that may be seen to affect different
markets.

By combining a TECHNICAL APPROACH together with the knowledge of the
various types of cycles effecting the human element, we will achieve a better under-
standing of how to deal with a markets position.

ALL MARKETS WORKS TO THEIR OWN DYNAMIC SYSTEM

Markets vibrate in price and time from highs to lows and lows to highs in minor
trends, intermediate trends & primary trends. Each trend of similar degree is the
direct EFFECT of an underlying CAUSE.

The CAUSE is the constant vibration of the numerous CYCLES at work in any par-
ticular complex.

Cycles range from SHORT TERM to LONG TERM, each could be equated as a __
single wheel rotating within the confines of a larger wheel, ie., wheels working within
wheels.

Nevertheless on many occasions market trend changes coincide with important cycle
events.

The most important of these are outlined in the pages ahead.

FUNDAMENTAL CYCLES

Fundamental cycles can develop within any market complex due to the regularity of
profit reports, production reports, crop estimate reports, federal reserve board meet-
ings, G7 meetings, government elections, government policies and so forth.

A little research will uncover the important dates to watch in the future.

66
CYCLES

NATURAL CYCLES (SEASONALS)

NATURAL CYCLES directly affecting the HUMAN ELEMENT are the seasonal
cycles of the planet we live on, ie., Earth. These are the most important cycles as our
life cycle is built around them.

Natural cycles are the direct result of the mechanical movements between EARTH,
MOON and the SUN.

When NATURAL CYCLE dates coincide with your technical TIME CYCLE RATIO
ANALYSIS you should be on the alert for a set up trading opportunity.

Important natural cycles to become familiar with are:-

° The Equinox and Solstice Cycle.

e The Apogee and Perigee Cycle.

e The Lunar Cycle - new and full moon.
° Solar Eclipse Phenomena (new moon).

EQUINOX AND SOLSTICE CYCLES

The equinox and solstice cycles are seasonal in nature. As the Earth revolves around
the Sun in an elliptical path each year it rotates on its north-south axis 365.25 times.

The Earth’s axis is inclined to the vertical by 23.5°.

Due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis the Sun appears to move backwards and
forwards in the sky over a one year period. This is why we have the seasons in reverse
between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.

inclined towards the Sun. times.

The four extreme cycle points are known as the Vernal equinox, Summer solstice,
Autumnal equinox and the Winter solstice.

If we measure the cycle (1 orbit around the Sun) as a 360° circle and use the Vernal
equinox, March 21 for the beginning 180° heliocentric (this is the day of the year when
the Sun crosses over the equator into the Northern hemisphere). The other points are
Summer sqlstice 270 (22 June), Autumnal equinox 360°(22 September) and Winter
solstice 90° (22 December).

The most interesting scientific fact relevant to CALENDAR TIME and the EARTH’S
PLANETARY MOTION is the relationship between days and degrees as the seasons
unfold. From the Vernal equinox 180° to the Autumnal equinox 360°, exactly half a
year in planetary cycle terms consumes 186 days. 6 more days than the 180° between

the Autumnal equinox and the Vernal equinox.

It is important to remind you that the important seasonal dates each year have been
used by ancient societies and religions to mark holidays and festivals. The first new
moon after the Vernal equinox marks the beginning of the crop planting season in the
Northern Hemisphere.

CYCLES

APOGEE AND PERIGEE CYCLE

If a satellite circles an object in an ellipse (oval path) there is a point in the orbit
where it is closest to the object, this point is the perihelion (PE IGFE) The point
where the satellite is furthest away is known as the aphelion (APOGEE).

The Earth orbits the Sun once a year in an elliptical path. As regular as clockwork we
experience a PERIGEE and APOGEE cycle.

APOGEE 3/4 July 282° Heliocentric
PERIGEE 2/3 January 102° Heliocentric

It’s interesting to note that the United States of America holds its Independence day
celebrations each year on the Apogee cycle date.

The Perigee marks the beginning of the new calendar year.
From Perigee to Apogee is exactly 180° in the circle of one year.

In terms of calendar days relative to degrees traveled the Earth speeds u the rate be-
tween the Apogee and the Perigee and slows down the rate between the Perigee and
the Apogee. The ratio of degrees of the circle are not constant with calendar days.

All the planets in the solar system travel around the Sun in elliptical paths some more
pronounced than others. The diagram below is in scale and illustrates the elliptical
paths around the Sun for Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Earths important seasonal

anniversaries are highlighted.

CYCLES

LUNAR CYCLE

Each 29.53 days the MOON moves through a cycle {orbit) from NEW to NEW. If we,
consider the New Moon to be 0° ona circle of 360°, the Full Moon will occur at 180.
From New to Full (180°) takes 14.75 days which falls closely in line with a two week
cycle. A Lunar year (12 cycles) takes 354 days.

Tidal effects on the EARTH’s surface are far greater at the time of the New Moon,
This may explain why certain events coincide with the new moon..

v The Moon shows phases because the Sun can
illuminate only one hemisphere. It rotates once on
its axis during the lunar month, therefore always
keeping the same face towards the Earth.

SOLAR ECLIPSES occurs at the time of the NEW MOON when the SUN - MOON
and EARTH are directly in a straight line.

Due to the nature of the moons orbit the SOLAR ECLIPSE new moon cycle falls only
every 6 new moons, 177 days (2 times 89 approximately) or half a lunar year.

PLANETARY CYCLES

Since time began the movements of the planets have held a fascination to man.
Serious researchers such as W.D. Gann, George Bayer and Donald Bradley have on oc-
casions used planetary analysis successfully as a timing tool for market prediction.

In the course of my research I too am convinced that planetary analysis can be an aid
to trading, ie., the movements of the planetary system and the repeating cycles all ap-
pear to coincide with events in the affairs of man. However, from my studies so far

am led to believe that planetary analysis is better used as an additional tool rather than
a primary tool.

The way I work is this. I first work out market timing using my conventional tools, then
I inspect the planetary positions and the time cycles of the planets from previous
market swings. If I find additional signals present I know the future timing points I
have calculated are more pronounced. Also whenever something odd occurs in a
market I inspect the planetary cycles to see if that can explain it.

To conduct planetary analysis of the markets is a tedious task for most. This is due to
the irregular movement or occurrence of relationships between the planets. As we
have already discussed the planets move in orbits around the Sun. Each planet’s path
is an ellipse (oval path), due to the acceleration and deceleration of rotation through
the course of the orbits no two consecutive aspects between planets occur at exact In-
tervals of time. In other words the aspects are occurring on a dynamic time basis.

Secondly the question arises - which cycles and aspects between planets are the most
important in the affairs of man.

e GEOCENTRIC PLANETARY ANALYSIS
e HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY ANALYSIS

It is difficult to say as both systems of analysis can be seen to produce results.

The course I have taken so far is to study three avenues of planetary analysis.

° PLANETARY ASPECTS
° PLANETARY RETURN CYCLES
° TIME CYCLE RATIOS USING INDIVIDUAL PLANETS - the same

approach we use for calendar time.

To conduct analysis of the planetary system requires EPHEMERIS TABLES. These
tables make it possible to locate the positions of the planets at any time. The planets
are dynamic in their movement due to their elliptical paths. EPHEMERIS TABLES
relate the planetary positions in degrees of the circle. The tables are kept in time we
are familiar with, ie., Earth time.

The following pages will give you a brief outline of the important points to note if you
are about to embark on a research venture into planetary analysis. If you wish to really
bury yourself into planetary analysis I can recommend several avenues of approach.

HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY POSITIONS

Heliocentric refers to a Sun centered universe. It is common knowledge today that the
planets revolve around the Sun rather than revolve around the Earth.

The planets in order out from the Sun are:-

GEOCENTRIC PLANETARY POSITIONS

The position of the planets when you view them from Earth.

The only planet or satellite that orbits the Earth is the Moon. Other planets do not

orbit the Earth, because they orbit the Sun they have irregular aspects with the Earth
and other planets. For instance an Earth-Sun-Mars opposition to opposition cycle can
vary between 750 and 820 days. There is also a considerable deviation between Earth-

Sun and Jupiter.

The Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are more uniform due
to the slowness of their orbits around the Sun.

I prefer to work with TIME CYCLES and observe the planetary aspects in both
LIOCENTRIC and GEOCENTRIC terms.

I’ve been fortunate to meet Doug Ingram from Austin, Texas who designed his own
EPHEMERIS TABLES to conduct planetary analysis. I have his program and can plot
the positions of the planets in Heliocentric and Geocentric terms, I can also do this
with my CycleTrader in a less sophisticated way.

Below is an example of the planetary positions on the 2nd June, 1992. Heliocentric
positions are on the left and Geocentric are on the right.

PLANETARY ASPECTS

An ASPECT is the term given to a triangular relationship between the position of any
three planets.

The aspects of importance mentioned by KEPLER are:-

The circle of 360° is divided in the proportions mentioned at each of the aspects.
A 90° aspect is often referred to as SQUARE.

On June 2nd, 1992 the STI EPHEMERIS below shows the heliocentric aspects of
JUpiter - SUN - EArth as 85° and the MArs - SUN - EArth as 94”. Both are very

In astrology planetary aspects can be interpreted as either hard or soft. In astro
economic terms individual markets are influenced by different planets. To be honest I
have to say I’m not sure how to interpret the likely effect of heliocentric or geocentric
aspects on future market activity. What I have discovered though is that frequently
markets make highs and lows when several planets line up in either oppositions or con-
junctions with the Sun and Earth. The June 2nd, 1992 example marked at least an in-
termediate degree high in the Dow Jones and a primary degree high in the Soybean
market.

The best way to decide how you may use the planetary aspects is to study individual
markets and see if trend changes have occured when significant planetary phenomena
was present.

In 1987 on August 25, the day when the Dow Jones made its all time high prior to the
CRASH wave. The following planets were all in a straight line:- Mars, Venus, Mer-
cury, Sun, Moon and Earth. Planetary observers proclaimed this was an extremely rare
event.

For my own purposes of research I have concentrated on the heliocentric movement of

the planets. I am more interested in the possible influences of the planets closer to
Earth,

I devised the CYCLETRADER HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY WHEEL to con-
duct fast research. The wheel can be started from any date between 1910 and 2000 and
moved forward or backwards. In doing so it is possible to see the aspects and the
relationships between the individual planetary motions.

One notable piece of information I can share with you is the coincidence of JUPITER -
SUN - EARTH aspects coinciding with the American share market highs and lows.

Here are two examples to wet your appetite:-

On the actual day of the 1987 SHARE MARKET CRASH Jupiter was in CONJUNC-
TION to Sun-Earth.

At the 1990 high of the DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS before a similar degree price
decline as the 1987 crash wave Jupiter was in OPPOSITION to Sun-Earth.

Two examples are only a coincidence, just the same I think this is a good place to start

your research on P ETARY ASPECTS and their possible influence in the affairs
of man.

PLANETARY RETURN CYCLES

It is well known to Gann analysts that the Earth cycle anniversaries of past market
highs and lows are points in time to watch for changes of trend. For instance a change
in trend may occur 1 year, 2 years, 3 years or 4 years from a prior swing high or low.
When several anniversaries from prior highs and lows fall on a future date that future
date can have a high probability for a change in trend.

Besides anniversaries of time we should also monitor divisions of the anniversaries, ie.,
ratios of the 1 year cycle. For instance 0.25, 0.333, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.666, 0.707,
0.786, 1.236, 1.272, 1.414, 1.5, 1.618, 1.732, 1.902, 2.236, 2.618 and so forth.

In recent years I have been back testing and monitoring the motion of other planets in
the same way as the Earth cycle. My main focus of research has been concentrated on
Venus, Mars and Jupiter cycles.

VENUS 2

Venus makes one full orbit of the Sun in 0.618 years (225 days), 1.618 orbits in 365
days (1 year) and 2 orbits in 1.236 years.

The Venus cycle time works dynamically to the Earth cycle time in the ratio of 1.618.

The GOLD market seems to react favorably to Earth and Venus cycles by making
highs and lows on strict time divisions of the cycles. Below are some examples that oc-
curred between 1991 and 1992.

MARS ofl

Mars makes one full orbit (360°) of the Sun every 687 days. This coincides with the
Gann composite time count 2 times 7° (7° = 343).

In so far as Earth is concerned Mars divisions of 1 cycle are far from constant in terms
of calendar days. Mars has a very pronounced elliptical path. Mars can travel 180° or
half an orbit in as short a time as 302 days or as long as 385 days.

The longest time for Mars to travel 180° in its orbit is 55 weeks, this time coincides
with the Fibonacci number and a Master number in ancient numerology.

If you were to compare the degrees traveled around the Sun between Earth and Mars
you would find that the Earth orbit could consume between 288° and 377° whilst Mars
travels only 180° in its orbit. 288 =2*144, 377 and 144 are related by 2.618 and are
Fibonacci numbers.

I have always been aware of the Mars cycle of 687 days being important for composite
time counts between market highs and lows. It is only in recent times that I have
noticed the Mars divisions of a an orbit marking market turning points in the same way
as the Earth divisions of a year.

I now count off divisions of the Mars year from important Share market highs and lows
to see how they may fit into the time equation which controls market trends. The only
way to do this effectively is with Ephemeris tables or a computer program equipped
with ephemeris tables. If you try to average out the 687 day cycle into divisions you
will never get the right answer.

With my swing chart approach for measuring time factors within the market structure,
I can now test time periods between market swing highs and lows quickly and accurate-
ly for planetary time cycles and divisions of time cycles.

JUPITER 4

Jupiter return cycles take 4331 day or 11.86 years. Due to the long time period in-
volved it is hard to find any accurate examples which you may follow.

A 180° transit of the Sun can vary between 2035 days and 2293 days, a 90° transit can
vary between 991 days and 1178 days. A 1° transit can vary between 11 days and 13 .
ays.

Venus and Mars are the closest planets to Earth therefore they should have more in-
fluence on man than the outer planets, especially when it comes to the tidal effects
generated by the gravitational forces at work on the Earths surface.

For my part I think that the planets to monitor are Sun, Venus, Moon, Earth and
Mars. When other outer planets are forming aspects or cycles that combine with these
planets they may add more weight to the signals.

Still of course, I would make sure to watch the planetary cycles of Jupiter as it takes no
extra time once you are set up to monitor planets.

PLANETARY PHASES

Most of the time VENUS transits 1.618° in its orbit to 1° of Earth transit.
Mars can transit between 0.618° and 0.477° to 1° of Earth transit.

Jupiter is more constant dransitin 30° between 0.9 and 1.05 Earth years. This is ap-
proximately 0.085” per 1° of Earth transit.

An interesting phenomena occurs when the planets transit for a time in harmonic
ratios, ie., Venus transits at 1.618°, Earth transits at 1 (benchmark), Mays transits at

TIME CYCLE RATIOS - INDIVIDUAL PLANETS

CYCLES

Another area of research I have been investigating over the past year or two has been

the relationships of time between several market swing highs and lows in IN-

DIVIDUAL PLANETARY TIME. This research has shown promise, just the same it
is to early for me to recommend it to anyone as a primary trading tool. Prospects are I
will never recommend it to anyone as a primary trading tool. Just the same I recom-
mend a little study in this area as it can help substantiate the degree of meaning of the
primary tools that I do recommend.

To conduct this form of analysis effectively requires Ephemeris tables. Also the calcula-
tions must be worked in heliocentric (time of orbit around the Sun) planetary move-

ment.

I have an Astro Cycle module in the CYCLETRADER that works off my SWING

CHARTS. I can mark several swin
RELATIONSHIPS for the planets

oints and review the DYNAMIC TIME
ENUS-EARTH-MARS-JUPITER.

Below is the SWING CHART I use for my long-term timing analysis of the DOW
JONES INDUSTRIALS INDEX, I zoomed it to included the 1974 low of 570 up until

October 1992, the highest high so far of 3435 fell on June 2, 1992.

The details on the left of the chart show the time factors for the two periods being
compared. In this case the crash low 871020 to the 1990 high 900717 and then the

projection to the current all time high 920602.
Two interesting time cycles have been highlighted :-
° From 900717 to 920602 is 1 Mars orbit.

e The Jupiter time 871020-900717 = 87.7° and the time 900717-920602 =
54.2°. The Jupiter movement of 54.2° is precisely 0.618 ratio of 87.7°.

Whenever I research any new method of TIME ANALYSIS I am only interested in ac-
curacy that comes within a day or two of the important ratios.

When it comes to trading it cannot be any other way, only a few days in the market the
wrong way around can send you broke.

I am yet to meet a planetary trader who has made consistent profits from the markets.
Most seem to spend their lives researching or using their research to write newsletters.
When you find a financial astrologer who recommends trades to subscribers you have
to ask yourself the question? How much of the recommendation is applicable to the
planetary cycles and how much is due to the writers intuition of the market in question.

The TEST of any technique of analysis boils down to one thing! - Can you make
money using it. If it can’t pass this test then it is only academic. Nevertheless a study of
the universe will re-enforce the importance of natural law and the habits of humans in
general.

The information I have passed forth in this section could take a novice years of study
to understand and appreciate. I know I certainly reversed out of many blind alleys
before I started to throw away the absurd ideas being bandied around by pseudo intel-
lectual technical analysts.

It still pays to keep an open mind, you never know how valuable some of these techni-
ques for identifying cycles could be in the future.

SUMMARY

Always be alert to your primary timing signals falling on or near Earth EQUINOXES,
SOLSTICES, APOGEES, PERIGEES, SOLAR ECLIPSES or MULTIPLE CON-
JUNCTIONS and OPPOSITIONS.

I have seen more than enough evidence of markets making highs and lows when these
planetary phenomena are present. For this reason I have educated myself to monitor
the planetary activity even if it is only as secondary tool.

The longer I monitor planetary cycles the more sense I seem to make out of my
primary timing tools.

CYCLETRADER WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY

WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY

What is a WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY?

WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY are future dates calculated in advance by a model
designed to look at future dates and interrogate past market swing highs and lows, for
dynamic and static time cycle relationships. Future dates are scored in strength for har-
monic relationships with the known data. The highest scores produced by the model
highlight high probability dates for reversals of trend, when the market is in a position
where change is likely. On occasions, where the market is not ready for change, and a
trend continues through a high scoring WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY the trend is
confirmed as strong and can be traded accordingly.

One must understand that any TIME CYCLE PROJECTION calculation into the fu-
ture is only a RANDOM EVENT, until proof exists to suggest it is anything else but.

When I first became proficient at using TIME CYCLE RATIO ANALYSIS to predict
future changes of trend I thought I had discovered the "Holy Grail". Initially my
analysis was excellent but my trading results were "hit and miss", often I did not know
how to filter the strength of the TIME CLUSTERS I was witnessing.

I learnt quickly that if I was going to rectify this problem, I needed to construct a __
model which evaluated each possible future signal day using a scaling approach, taking
into account the randomness of the generated signals.

I started out by looking at the relationships that occur between three consecutive
market pivots. Then I added a fourth and fifth then a sixth.

Ultimately I settled on using five previous market pivots to predict a future date where
the TIME CYCLE RELATIONSHIPS were in such HARMONY that they could hard-
ly be seen as RANDOM INDICATIONS.

My whole concept has been based on the theory that all market waves of similar de-
gree must relate when change is possible.

If the 5 market pivots being used have formed relationships within themselves, then
these same 5 points can be used to project a sixth, seventh and even eighth point in the
future where all time cycles return to harmonic relationships. These future points are
instants in time where a change in trend is possible.

Due to the complexity of cycles and their relative degree it is possible to have one
level of cycle degree over-ride another level at different times. For this reason I have
found it pays to run several studies using different cycle levels. As a general rule
though the Intermediate degree level has produced the most obvious results.

The CycleTrader WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY module is unique and the results
have been astounding.

CYCLETRADER WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY

CONCEPTS FOR SELECTING MARKET PIVOT POINTS

To illustrate how I use the WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY MODEL to its best ad-
vantage requires an example.

The most reliable TECHNICAL MARKET I follow is the GOLD COMPLEX. The
reason I believe this market produces the best results is for the following reasons.

1. The traders in this market have a very diversified background of interests.

2. The GOLD market has little to no outside influences being generated by
government interference or statutory reporting.

3. Trade dealings are well and truly balanced by the speculator interest.

In basic terminology one could say that the GOLD market is the purest of all markets
given that it is mostly motivated by fear and greed and the psychology of the crowd.

Ist Month COMEX GOLD futures.

The following chart is for the COMEX 1st MONTH GOLD FUTURES, prices start-
ing at the 1990 low, up to and including the 11th September, 1991 low.

The wave points marked are extreme pivot points prior to intermediate degree chan-
ges of trend. Each of the pivot points are bonded by important time relationships.

The highest scoring date within three months of the 11th September, 1991 low was 6th
December, 1991. The 9th December was the 100% TCR of the 910610 high to the
910911 low. The static counts of 13 weeks and 0.25 of a year added to the importance
of this projection. The 6th was a friday and the 9th was the monday, the highest high in
the rally from 910911 fell on the 9th December. Trend indicators such as the RSI and
the Slow Stochastic were anticipating a change in trend was possible at this time.

In other words the coast was clear for a trade to short this market when the time signal
day marked the highest high since the rally began.

The downtrend from 911209 to 920429 was the longest of any of the other waves we
have been using. The 911209 - CycleTrader report had 3 real high scoring days 127,
126 and 124. The last one, 124 on the 30th April, 1992 was within one day of the turn-
ing point.

The downtrend to the 920429 low lasted almost 5 months, 142 days to be precise. To
only have had three major scoring dates from the 911209 report and 1 after January
from the 910911 report to monitor, for intermediate degree trend change oppor-
tunities, certainly took the horror out of preparing TIME ANALYSIS REPORTS.

The April 30, 1992 WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY - SIGNAL DAY turned out to be
the only one which qualified as an INTERMEDIATE DEGREE BOTTOM proposi-
tion. All the other projection dates arrived and left when the market was hardly in a
position to indicate any new important low being made. Although it is significant to
see phat two of the projection dates marked points where Minor degree trend reversals
took place.

The April 29th, 1992 low in gold was probably one of the hardest bottoms to recog-
nize, this was due to the small ranges and the length of time the market spent around
the price low of 920429.

day over 5 months in advance, using the principles of time relationships within market

The previous two charts show how a rhythmic vibration between three common points
and the 18th September, 1992 harmonized on 0.618 and 1.000 time cycle ratios.

The only way to be certain that a WOO high scoring day will result in a reversal of
trend is to identify a rhythm between the past cycle highs and lows and the current
market position.

I have constructed a matrix type approach in my UPDATE MODULE to test for
rhythm each time a new high or low is made. I can also adjust the date forward or back-
wards to finetune the ratios. This approach is handy when you have clusters of si nal
days falling over a three or four day period. Anything that is important to the techni-
que of time and price analysis will be highlighted in bright lights on my computer
screen when the facts are available. The way to read this report is simple. The waves
being analyzed are tabled at the top of the screen. In this case 9 waves from the 16th
October, 1990 up to the 18th September, 1992 high day.

The four columns headed DAYS, SOLAR, WEEKS and YEARS are the time periods
elapsed from that prior swing up to and including the target date. If you look down the
DAYS column you will see several near hits to Fibonacc! numbers and multiples of
Fibonacci numbers. For instance 144, 288(2" 144), 377, 466 (2°233) and 610. 5 out of 9
is a pretty good strike rate. The other columns allow you to look for significant rhythm
signals in the same manner.

The main area of interest is within the dynamic time structure of the unfolding waves.
The matrix takes into account vibrations forward of the last 3 definite and the last pos-
sible swing date. You can determine sequences of rhythm in two ways, first by looking
down each column for coincidence of multiple ratios or second by looking horizontally
across the tables for a coincidence of multiple ratios. When past cycle times bein
measured are close to important STATIC TIME COUNTS and the TIME CYCL
RATIOS are on important ratios there is an exceptional chance that time is being
squared and a change of trend is possible. All you require for confirmation is a squar-
ing of price. In this illustration price squared a 0.707 retracement.

CycleTrader and TIME CYCLE RATIOS - TCR’s

Time cycle ratios (TCR’s) are the bonds that link the dynamic forces of the market
together. Time is our most valuable technical tool and it is important that we continual-
ly keep our time analysis current with the market trends.

The WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY module scans forward dates for the coincidence
of TCR’s which are above and beyond an accepted level of randomness. Dates with ir-
regularly high scores could be where a future trend change will occur.

The UPDATE module allows us to VISUALLY scan for cycle ratios quickly and
automatically over short or long periods of time, ie., we can inspect a complex for the
coincidence of TCR’s over years, months or days.

The REPORT module allows one to test a future date to verify the coincidence of
TCR’s. All calculations are automatic and are determined by the SWING CHART
used for the procedure.

The following TIME CYCLE REPORT has been prepared using the INTER-
MEDIATE DEGREE swing points in the Gold beginning with the 900614 low. These
can be identified in the left column of the report as PIVOT DATE. The START
SWING column contains the begin date of the TCR to be matched to the pivot date.
The TIME CYCLE is the number of calendar days between the PIVOT DATE & the
START DATE. The FUTURE KEY DATE is the next ratio date of the TIME CYCLE
taking into account the date selected for the report. Only TCR’s falling within 9 days
of the report date will be highlighted. The greater number of TCR’s emerging from
one PIVOT DATE the more coincidence of RHYTHM within the cycles. The TCR’s
generated from the 920429 low pivot are extremely strong this is why the WOO report
ad such a high score for the 19th September.

SUMMARY

The GOLD examples I have just displayed were not constructed after the event. In
fact similar time reports, highlightin the same trend change dates, were published in
advance in the WAVE TR R DIGEST. Subscribers were alerted in advance to the
dates when they could expect a change in trend. Don’t call for a subscription as the
WAVE TRADER DIGEST will be retired at the end of 1992. The 1992 issues have
been included as an appendix to this text.

The WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY MODEL uses proprietary formulas to search
each future day for harmonic time cycle relationships. Time cycles in markets are not
fixed length cycles, they may be in some instances, but mostly they are continually
changing with the dynamic input from the overall influences.

The WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY MODEL is designed to apply the principles of
TIME CYCLE ANALYSIS to any commodity, currency, stock or index. The system of
time analysis I use works in all free trading markets.

The model can calculate from any 5 dates which represent market swings highs and
ows.

The SCORING SYSTEM IS RELATIVE to the overall study. For instance on some
samples I have seen scores of up to 180, these usually stand out from the crowd. In
other samples (usually primary degree) a highest score may only reach 80. The impor-
tant issue 1s to locate dates where the score rises dramatically above the model noise.

HIGH SCORING DAYS are found when the harmonic cycle relationships between.
the future date and the 5 known waves reaches a level which suggests the relationships
are too coincidental to be RANDOM.

When setting up the model always try and use a series of waves which are bonded by a
high level of relationships. The greater the RHYTHM in the study waves the better
the report will be.

When the 5 known waves themselves have a rhythm relationship, the future high scor-
ing days can be exceptionally strong indications for a change in trend.

The CycleTrader license agreement stipulates that any proprietary routine is for the
use of the licensee and not for general publication. It is a breach of the license to pub-
lish CycleTrader Windows of Opportunity reports in advance. The reason is simply be-
cause it disadvantages the people who have purchased the CycleTrader.

The WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY MODEL should not be used as a “black box".
AU ECHNICAL TIMING TOOLS must be used in context with PRICE, PATTERN

TRADING FOR PROFITS

TRADING FOR PROFITS

It may seem like a cliche but the reason I have devoted over 10 years of my life to the
study of technical indicators and understanding of markets was to become an elite
trader.

The first thing I should tell you is. You can know everything possible about analyzing a
market and technically predicting changes of trend, nevertheless on its own this 1s not
a license to make money.

To make money you must know how to trade.

A good trader does not need to be a good forecaster but a good forecaster needs to be
a good trader to make money.

With a solid knowledge of how to trade you can be your own boss and reside at any
location of your choice.

You can maintain an independence from the rank and file.
You can work when you want or go on holiday at the drop of a hat.

Just so long as you follow a steady daily, weekly and monthly work procedure oppor-
tunities will present themselves, time and time again.

When I see opportunity in the markets I concentrate, when I don’t have a clue I rest. I
am not a slave to the market, the market is my slave, the market is also my friend. I
am unafraid of my friend.

The important issue in trading is in knowing how to take best advantage of the prospec-
tive opportunities one encounters.

The most successful traders are those who work to a plan, keep control of their emo-
tions and execute their plan flawlessly.

The first part of the plan is in knowing what you want to do each day.
1. Do you wish to be LONG, SHORT or FLAT.

2. What RISK do you have to accept before you are proved wrong.
3. Can you accept this risk in your trading plan.

YOUR SUCCESS IN THE REAL WORLD WILL ONLY BE DETERMINED BY
YOUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO SIMILAR BUT CHANGING SITUATIONS.

This section contains an outline of the important points I have noted essential to
making a success of trading for profits.

95
TRADING FOR PROFITS

IMPORTANT POINTS | HAVE NOTED THAT AID SUCCESS IN
TRADING

KNOWLEDGE

A basic knowledge of the recurring price behavior, the markets you trade, go through
under similar circumstances.

INFORMATION

You cannot trade without information, ie., you will need an information source to
evaluate any unforeseen influences entering the markets that you trade. Generally a
good daily financial television news service or newspaper will be sufficient.

CONFIDENCE

Once you have the technical ability, local market knowledge and the information
source, you will need confidence. With confidence a trader can take on any challenge
in the market. Whether he wins or looses he can still maintain his head about him and
be prepared to trade again. This of course pre-supposes one has a trading plan and the
personal discipline to carry out that plan.

CONTROLLED EGO

A traders ego can become his worst enemy. If you have an ego problem, ie., you are al-
ways trying to force your own will on the market and for that matter every one else
around you, you will never succeed at trading. The successful trader must be prepared
to listen to the market and let it tell him what it is doing. Never argue with the market
it is seldom wrong.

FINANCIAL SECURITY

The most successful traders are those traders who are not forced to trade the markets
for the rent check. Traders who have financial security are free to trade when it suits
them best. This luxury allows a trader too only take the trades offering the best oppor-
tunity. This industry has a very high turnover rate of unsuccessful traders, the primary
reason is simply due to the fact most treat trading markets as a gambler would. If a
trader can be patient and wait until all the requirements for a successful trade are met
he will be assured of success, ie., if he follows the rules.

Of all the people I have met in this industry the one person who has influenced me the
most is Larry Pesavento from Pismo Beach, California. Larry has over 25 years ex-
perience as a trader, he has made a living as a broker, a floor trader and now trades
privately for himself from his office in Pismo Beach. On top of this he has experienced
every possible high and low related to the day to day practice of trading leveraged
markets. Larry also has a library of books second to none, he has researched every pos-
sible approach to analyzing a market I have ever heard of, and some I haven’t heard of.

Larry can be contacted via P.O.B. 1106, Pismo Beach, CA 93448. Larry conducts a two
day trading course for students of technical methods. Larry gives a money back guaran-
tee, ie., if he can’t make a profit from the markets he is educating you in trading, on
the day you attend his class, he will refund your tuition fee. You can’t get a better self
recommendation than this.

MONEY MANAGEMENT

Before even contemplating a trading program you will need to establish some money
management rules.

UNBREAKABLE RULES

1. Never trade without first preparing your "checklist".

2. Never risk more than 5% of your trading capital on any
one trade.

3. Never take a trade unless your profit expectation is at least
triple your downside risk.

4. Always have a protective stop in the market.

5. Never add to a losing position.

Trading decisions can be initiated for a number of reasons known only to the in-
dividual trader.

Even when this is the case it’s important to adhere to the following guidelines.

GUIDELINES

1. Never trade on "hunches".

2. Never trade "purely" on other peoples advice.

3. Always have a clear and reasonable idea of your
objective.

4. Always do your analysis prior to entering a trade.

5. Update your analysis outside of market hours.

6. Take responsibility for your trades.

7. Never close a trade without a good reason.

8. Always be prepared for the "unexpected".

"Take care of your losses and the profits will take care of themselves." -
Amos Hostetter, Commodity Corporation (circa 1967).

97
TRADING FOR PROFITS

TRADING RULES

For a trader to make a success in the business of trading he must view all dimensions
of market activity in his analysis and trading strategies.

The four most important dimensions of market activity are:-
TIME - PRICE - PATTERN & TREND MOMENTUM

When all four dimensions of market activity indicate trend change or a continuation of
trend the trader has the best opportunity of success.

Traders must have patience and discipline to only initiate trading action at the ideal
market set-ups that conform to the trading plan.

RULE 1.

TIME Is THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKET FACTOR

Time analysis needs to be prepared in advance to indicate "high probability" dates, in
the future, where a change in trend CAN OCCUR.

A change in trend will "never" occur in a free trading market without the COIN-
CIDENCE OF TIME CYCLE RATIO ANALYSIS SIGNALS.

Time cycle ratios can be measured from past market activity in several degrees.
e MINOR - INTERMEDIATE - PRIMARY degree.

A PRIMARY degree TREND CHANGE requires that all three degrees of past market ac-
tivity are signaling TIME CYCLE SIGNAL DAYS within close proximity to each
other. The term used to describe this phenomena is SIGNAL DAY CLUSTERS.

An INTERMEDIATE degree TREND CHANGE requires signal day clusters to be formed by
both the MINOR and the INTERMEDIATE degree past market activity. Single time
cycle ratios from PRIMARY degree waves are often present.

A MINOR degree TREND CHANGE requires signal day clusters to be formed from the
MINOR degree waves. Single time cycle ratios, rather than clusters, should be evident
within the near term INTERMEDIATE degree wave activity.

Always assess your objectives by the :-

e QUALITY of the TIME CYCLE RATIOS
° QUANTITY of the TIME CYCLE RATIOS
° DEGREE of the TIME CYCLE RATIOS

When TIME CYCLES indicate opportunity for trading profits get prepared and study
PRICE RELATIONSHIPS for the trigger to enter trades.

98
TRADING FOR PROFITS

RULE2.

PRICE RELATIONSHIPS between waves of similar degree must be apparent
when the TIME CYCLE RATIOS signal a change of trend.

e PRICE CAN BE COMPARED IN UNITS or PERCENTAGE CHANGE

Price relationships unfold in exactly the same way as time cycles, ie., MINOR, INTER-
MEDIATE and PRIMARY degree.

The market is a DYNAMIC SYSTEM which can be measured in a two dimensional
GEOMETRIC MANNER.

° PRICE IS THE CONFIRMATION THAT TIME IS UP

Although PRICE can be calculated in advance, I have found it will pay to wait until

just a few days before the TIME SIGNALS are at their peak, before "predicting" the
evels to which price may terminate trend.

As a market approaches PRICE SUPPORT or PRICE RESISTANCE LEVELS you
will see by the daily price activity how it is acting. Depending on the volatility in the
market you will have a fair guide to the price possibilities. These possibilities become
real rather than just educated guesses when performed close to a “high probability
trend change date".

If you try and calculate price targets for markets too far in advance you can become
emotional about them, if you just listen to the market and let it dictate the price it is
going to terminate trend on you will be more at ease.

RULES.

When you have used TIME & PRICE to establish the INTERMEDIATE DEGREE
trend only trade in the direction of that trend. Buy weakness, sell strength.

As the trend unfolds you will see from the minor corrections if the trend is still strong
enough to trade. If the trend continues to confirm the INTERMEDIATE DEGREE
analysis you can pyramid your positions. Just remember you need to maintain close
stops on every re-entry or pyramid trade.

Be guided by the price above the 20 day moving average as an indicator of an intact
trend. Use trend lines, trend waves and minor retracement levels to judge retracement
corrections versus complete change of trend.

When you get an opportunity to add to a winning position you must do so if you wish
to capitalize on your knowledge of time and price analysis.

Study the character of ELLIOTT WAVE formations so that you will be prepared for
continuations of trend or complete reversals of trend.

Once a strong trend is in force don’t ever go against it unless you have a completely
oversold/overbought market analysis on your hands. If you do always keep close stops
to control your losses if you are premature.

99
TRADING FOR PROFITS

TRADING PLAN

For a trading plan to be successful it requires consistency, ie., once established you fol-
low all trigger signals that comply to your plan.

It is not necessary to be in the market all the time, only when the opportunity to profit
is paramount.

My trading plan has two important ingredients:-

Pinpoint Intermediate degree trend change points and buy or sell with a known risk
level.

Buy into weakness and sell into strength when my trend indicators are signalling the
Intermediate degree trend is intact.

Trend Indicators can tell you one of three things:-

° Trend is intact.
e Trend is overbought or oversold.
e Trend is in a position for a possible reversal.

When the trend indicators signal the trend is intact I look for opportunities to re-enter
the main trend on MINOR degree corrections.

When the trend indicators signal overbought or oversold I look to exit positions at the
next time and price target. this will normally be a 3rd wave termination of some degree.

After any fast price correction without any follow through - resulting from overbought
or oversold trend signals I will look to re-enter in the direction of the prior trend, only
if a 4th wave correction retracement level is easily identified.

Once a 5th wave is identified, whether or not I am on it, I will be looking for diver-
gence of trend with price activity which coincides with Intermediate degree time con-
vergence.

Once the market confirms the intermediate degree trend reversal the process begins
anew.

GUIDELINES

One of the surest ways to make money in the futures markets is to be a WRITER OF
OPTIONS. The odds are always with you for options expire worthless 90% of the time.
If you can identify the points that a market will not trade beyond, in the time period of
the option, the closer you enter to these points the greater your reward. Option
premiums deteriorate with time no matter if the price stays steady.

Only be a buyer of options when you expect an explosive move, then buy way out of
the money options for huge leverage.

Buy contracts only when you are confident you can control the risk with a reasonably
close stop loss.

100
TRADING FOR PROFITS

Time and price analysis in conjunction with trend indicators should allow you to clearly
anticipate the INTERMEDIATE DEGREE trend.

From a trading viewpoint the most money can be made out of the Intermediate degree
market moves, and on a more consistent basis.

It is rarely important from a traders viewpoint what extreme price levels a market may
reach over the long-term, just so long as one identifies the I RMEDIATE DE-
GREE turning points and acts with a sensible approach.

Once you have identified an Intermediate degree trend and got on board you should —

PUSH every re-entry signal if you wish to compound your profits. Once you have their
money as a buffer you must compound profits at every opportunity whilst the original

analysis holds firm.

The biggest price moves in stocks and commodities happen when the majority least ex-
pect them, it is always prudent to remember this and make sure you are in the market
at the earliest opportunity.

Whenever something unrealistic occurs in the market you will have every chance to
participate. Whenever you are wrong you will be taken out by your stop loss and incur
no irreparable damage.

Never trade against the prevailing trend unless you have every indication from TIME
and PRICE SIGNALS that the prevailing trend has expired.

When you do anticipate a final high or low is being made in any market ensure that
the BULLISH CONSENSUS OPINION is at an extreme reading. If you are going to
short a top in a bull market ensure that everyone is bullish. If you are going to buy a
bear market low ensure that everyone is bearish. The more bullish or bearish the
market consensus is at a high or low the greater your chances of picking the exact top
or bottom using TIME & PRICE TOOLS. When the market is out of control TIME &
PRICE relationships are your best guide to the TREND.

If you take care of the INTERMEDIATE DEGREE ANALYSIS the CYCLE DE-
GREE will look after itself.

One of W.D. Gann’s famous sayings was,

"THERE IS NO PRICE TOO HIGH TO BUY, AND NO PRICE TOO LOW TO SELL".
This is perhaps one of the best pieces of advice to keep in mind. If you for instance get
emotionally involved with the fundamental perceptions of fair value or your opinion of

what price levels a commodity or stock should trade at, you will ambush your trading
plan.

Be guided by your indicators at all times, that’s why you have them.

USE ALL OF YOUR TOOLS - ALL OF THE TIME

APPENDIX 1

ANCIENT GEOMETRY & NUMEROLOGY

INTRODUCTION

Teachers in the centers of education throughout the ancient world, such as those
founded by PYTHAGORAS in the sixth century BC, understood that it is impossible for
anyone to learn anything until he has experienced its truth for himself. Therefore they
set their pupils to practice the arts of DYNAMIC GEOMETRY and NUMEROLOGY in
order to exercise the faculty of INTUITION.

It was believed that ANY situation in life may be represented as a DYNAMIC PATTERN
for which there exists a precedent in nature.

PLATO wrote that the man who acquires the art of stereometry, the likening of unlike
things, sanctifies not only himself but also the city and the age in which he lives. For
the instrument to be effective, it requires that the individual become aware of the cur-
rent influences to which he is subjected; for by analogy with the dynamics of geometri-
cal and numerological relationships, the world of phenomena is revealed as the
product of archetypal forces, whose behavior in any circumstances is predictable once
their nature is understood.

The ancient philosophers devised a canon of proportion, numbers and mathematical
ratios, these ratios were not invented but in fact a revelation of the cosmic proportions
of the universe.

The canon of proportions has been preserved from antiquity throughout the ages
within art forms and architecture. The sacred geometry ound in such structures as THE
GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA contains the "secrets" of the universe.

These notes will provide the student with an explanation of the sacred proportions,
how they are derived, and practical examples on how they are manifested within the af-
fairs of men, to wit the speculative markets.

By knowing that there is an unfolding geometry in market movement, the reader can
then set to work and formulate rules to follow in his quest for market understanding.

GEOMETRIC PRINCIPLES

° PHILOSOPHICAL GEOMETRY

Ancient philosophers taught upils the arts of SACRED GEOMETRY in order to
develop their faculty of I ur ION.

Geometry attempts to recapture the orderly movement from an infinite formlessness
to an endless interconnected array of forms, and in recreating this mysterious passage
from ONE to TWO, it renders it symbolically visible.

The practice of Sacred Geometry is one of the essential techniques of self-develop-
ment.

Geometry deals with pure form, and philsophical geometry re-enacts the unfolding of
each form out of the preceding one.

e THE CANON OF PROPORTION

The binding natural law of mathematics as we know it today ORIGINATES from the
COSMOS. t was not invented by man, just revealed to him through his study of the
lanets.

The 7th wonder of the ancient world, the great pyramid of Giza, holds within its struc-
ture all of the "secrets" we need to be aware of.

The pyramid is a graphic representation of the Earth and Moon and their combined
movements around the Sun. The pyramid demonstrates the binding relationships be-
tween the SQUARE, CIRCLE & the GOLDEN MEAN.

APPENDIX 1 - 3
GEOMETRY OF MARKETS II - APPENDIXES

Modern day scientific studies have (amongst other things) confirmed the measure-
ments of the Moon and the Earth.

The radius of the Moon is 1080 miles and the radius of the Earth is 3960 miles.

A combined total of 5040 miles (Plato’s mystical number and in calendar days equal to
720 weeks, 2 times 360, 3 times 240, 4 times 180, 5 times 144 and 8 times 90).

A square encompassing a circle representing the Earth has four sides, each equal to
the diameter of the Earth, ie., 3960 by 2 or 7920 miles. The perimeter of this square
calculates to 31680 miles (4 times 7920, 44 times 720, 88 times 360, 132 times 240, 176
times 180, 220 times 144 and 352 times 90).

If the Moon and the Earth were placed side by side the distance between the two
centers would be equal to the sum of the radii, ie., 3920 plus 1080, which equals 5040
miles. A circle drawn using the combined radii of 5040 would have a circumference of
2at or 2x(22/7)x5040, which equals 31680.

The relationship of the circles circumference to the square’s perimeter is 1.000:1.000.

This geometric exercise is known as squaring the circle. Pi (~) being the Pythagorean
measure of 22/7 used to calculate the dimensions in a circle or sphere. In decimal form
aw is the irrational ratio 3.14159.

The radius of the circle 5040 (1080+ 3960) as a factor of the Earth’s radius 3960 is
equal to 5040:3960 or 1.2727:1.000. And 1.272 is mathematically the square root of

A hypotenuse calculation for a right angled triangle using the 5040 radius of the above
circle and half the side of the above square, ie., the radius of the Earth 3960, would
give the following result.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, ie., the length of the hypotenuse in a right angled (90
degree triangle) will be equal to the square root of the sum of the squares in the other
two sides.

Hypotenuse square root [(5040x5040) + (3960x3960)]

6409 miles

If we call the base of the triangle the Earth’s radius, ie., 3960 then the hypotenuse
6409.6 as a ratio of the base 3960 is 6409:3960 or 1.618:1.000

1.618 is commonly known as the Golden mean, it is represented by the Greek symbol
and called PHI.

If we call the height of the triangle the combined radii of the Earth and Moon, ie.,
3960 + 1080 or 5040 then the hypotenuse 6409 as a ratio of the height is 6409:5040 or
1.272:1.000

The irrational ratio 1.272 is the square root of 1.618, ie., 1.272 = 1/1.618

It can be demonstrated by this exercise where the designers of the Great Pyramid of
Giza procurred their measurements. It can also be seen that the irrational ratios of
=1.618 and a = 3.14159 are related.

1/4 (3.142) = 0.786 (1/ \/1.618)

1/4 is a harmonic ratio from the square and 1.618 is the Golden Mean.

° THE DIAGONAL OF THE SQUARE (ROOT 2 = 1.4142)

The square is bounded by four equal sides at right angles to each other.

Using the Pythagorean theorem we can calculate the diagonal ratio length. This ratio
will always maintain the same relationship in any square.

A square with sides equal to 1.000 has a diagonal of:-
V(1" + 1) or 2 which is 1.4142

ANCIENT NUMEROLOGY

Pythagoras said, "All is arranged according to number". In addition to QUAN TITY,
numbers on the ideal level are possessed of QUALITY.

It is not the intention of these notes to explain why certain numbers are relevant to
MARKET ANALYSIS, only too make you aware that they exist. Many excellent
reference books specifically devoted to these subjects are recommended in the bibliog-

raphy.

e 5040 = PLATO’S MYSTICAL NUMBER

The Master Time Factor 5040 is the combined total of the Earth radius - 3960 and the
Moon radius - 1080 in miles.

This is the Gann time division of 720 weeks, you could also call it the master time fac-
tor. 720 represents two circles of 360°.

Any number can be sub-divided into Geometric, Arithmetric and Harmonic means.
Each mean can be added together with the other to form the whole.
e MEANS OF 5040

Geometric means of 1.000 are 0.618 and 0.382 :-
3115 : 1925 = 5040

Arithmetic means of 1.000 are 0.666 and 0.333 :-
3357 : 1683 = 5040

Harmonic means of 1.000 are 0.586 and 0.414 :-
2954 : 2086 = 5040

Important numerology of 5040:-
1683 - 1925 - 2086 - 2954 - 3115 - 3357

APPENDIX 1 - 12
GEOMETRY OF MARKETS II - APPENDIXES

e 1080 & 3960 MOON & EARTH RADII

Next we can sub-divide the two components of 5040, ie., 1080 and 3960

Geometric means 1080 = 666 : 414 3960 = 2447: 1513
666 = The number of man.
Arithmetic means 1080 = 720 : 360 3960 = 2638 : 1322

720 = Ganns master time factor.

360 = the number of degrees in the circle.

Harmonic means 1080 = 633 : 447 3960
633 = 90 weeks or 1.732 years.

2321 : 1639

So far we now have a series of important NUMBERS that could appear in the future
time cycles of any market. You can then take this exercise to the next stage by adding
each of the means to the prime number.

For example:-

1080 + 666 = 1746 The number of fusion.
1080 + 414 = 494

1080 + 633 = 1713

1080 + 447 = 1527

1080 + 720 = 1800

1080 + 360 = 1440

3960 + 2447 = 6407

3960 + 1513 = 5473

And you could continue...

Next one could sub-divide the original means. For example:-

Geometric Arithmetic Harmonic
666 = 412 : 254 444 : 222 390 : 276
414 = 256 : 158 276 : 138 243 : 171
720 = 445 : 275 480 : 240 422 : 298
360 = 222 : 138 240 : 120 211: 149
633 = 391 : 242 422 : 211 371 : 262
447 = 276: 171 298 : 149 262 : 185

It can be seen that a high percentage of the new numbers are repeating in the future
calculations.

As this process is continued either by increasing or decreasing the means of each
series we would end up with that many numbers it becomes mind boggling.

IMPORTANT NUMEROLOGICAL COUNTS

In the process of analysising market cycles it will pay to be aware of several series of
numerological counts.

Each of the series of counts presented here have a common origin, ie., they are deriva-
tives of the ancient teachings or they are time cycles discovered by researchers which
seem to occur regularly within cycles of market trends.

illustrated

In the end we could nearly cover every number under the Sun. For this reason we
need to develop an approach that clarifies when to and when not to accept these
CYCLE NUMBERS as important in our day to day analysis of markets.

But as Pythagoras says, "All is arranged by number". So we need to be mindful of their
relative portance especially when they coincide with TIME CYCLE RATIO

THE POSITION OF THE STOCK MARKET AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE YEAR IS A GOOD GUIDE TO ITS EXPECTED PERFORMANCE.

There’s an age old axiom that goes like this,

"The US stock market usually makes its high or low for the year in
January".

There’s another one that says,
"The stock market usually rises in an election year".

Throughout 1991 I was continually looking for a top in the US stock market indices.
We have caught plenty of downturns but none of them have amounted to anything
more than sharp corrections. I am still long term bearish about the stock market so
where better to start 1992 than with the S&P 500 index.

The chart on page 1 demonstrates the use of the WAVETRADER layer routine. That
is the divisions of the total range between the chart high and low.

In this example you can see that the price range from the October 1990 low to the cur-
rent high is exactly 0.618 of the total price range from the 1987 crash low.

This is an important technical event if a confirmation of a top is signalled.

Confirmation of a long-term top would occur in the event that this index trades below
365.

Another technical event worth pointing out is the fact that this index has climbed a
"wall of worry" and at the last advance it took off on very low volume. The current rally
has been one of the fastest upmoves I have witnessed, it has the character of an Elliott
wave 5.

DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS INDEX

Strong technical price signals indicating a top of some degree. Since this index is an
"average" it is highly probable that we would get strong geometric relationships in per-
centage change.

SWISS FRANC IMM

Did you see what I saw when the March SFRC made the high 73.98 on the 8th J anuary.

The ist month futures 61.8% retracement level was at 74.00 and two long-term time
cycles were in harmony.

The time from the 1985 low to the 1987 high timed out 1.4142 (root 2, the diagonal of
the square) from the 1987 high. This vibration incident] squared 1.000 when the high
of November 1990 was made and 1.236 when the low of. July 1991 came in.

On top of this the time from the 1985 low to the 1989 low timed out 0.625 from the
1989 low. This vibration squared 0.500 at the July 1991 low.

The trend had been in progress for 6 months from the July 1991, low and the price rise
basis 1st month futures was 11.44 exactly 2.000 times the value of the 24th December,
1990 to 6th February, 1991 rally in 4 times the time. If we call that wave a Ist alternate
as the wave trader does we can see the unfolding geometry of price, ie., 0.618 and
2.000 when compared with the two previous waves of similar degree.

COMEX GOLD

All is going to plan in this complex and we have had a pretty good rein on it since the
latter part of last year. If the current vibrations hold their rhythm the next best trading
opportunity date is the 3rd February, 1992.

Friday the 10th January saw 1st month futures reach a 50% retracement of the recent
falls and pull back sharply. If we just take each step as it comes we should be able to
make a bundle out of this market in 1992. The long-term trend is still bearish and a
new low should be expected.

If the low of September 1991, $343 breaks support exists at $333, $324, $318 and $305.
The best level out of all of these appears to be the $324.

US T-BONDS CBOT

WAVE TRADER DIGEST

Volume 3 Issue 1

The US T-BOND YIELD hit a strong support the other day, the 1986 low of 7.6%.
The geometrics nevertheless look incomplete. I suspect that once a healthy correction
occurs the long-term target for T-BONDS will be in the region of 114 8/32 (7% yield)

then 123 (6.5% yield).

Now that the bond contract is trading above 100 it is moving in the inverse of points
relative to the 8% coupon rate. It takes a hell of a lot more points increase to drop the
yield once over 100 than it did when it was under 8%.

With the gyrations in the currency exchange rates of many countries these days it pays
to remember that a devaluation in your countries exchange rate lowers your standard
of living.

You may think that a lower local currency value enhances your prospects for increas-
ing your exports and adds to your external income, nevertheless your overall debt is in-
creased and the cost of servicing your interest payments goes up dramatically. In the

long run your country is like a dying business on the road to bankruptcy.

Unfortunately Australia is becoming such a place and anyone who thinks that the real
value of their assets have increased in the past 12 years is kidding themselves.

Beware of politicians who try and camouflage inflationary policies by changing the sys-
tem, especially when times are difficult and the masses are willing to accept anything
new.

US EQUITY MARKETS IN NEED OF HEALTHY CORRECTION ?7??

The continuing rise in the DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL INDEX never fails to amaze
us. All of our technical signals would suggest that the DJIA & S&P500 were about to
undergo major corrections, nevertheless there has been little follow through from the
highs of January 15. Maybe as H.M. Gartley said in his course PROFITS IN THE

T, 1935, published by Lambert-Gann, Pomeroy, see below, is
worthwhile advice.

Our current opinion of the DJIA is this - To confirm a major top is in place a break
below 3120 then 3000 would be required. If a new high is made, ie., above 3300 the
next major target price is 3715.
February, 1992 WAVE TRADER DIGEST Volume 3 Issue 2

S&P 500 UPDATE

Since the last digest price levels have been going sideways with no confirmation that a
collapse is forthcoming. The S&P 500 needs to trade below 400 and then below 390 to
give any comfort to the "SHORTERS".

The present position is one similar to a see-saw in full balance, the current major trend
position favours another final bullish wave to new highs even though time and price

are square at the last high. It’s as though we have just completed a wave 3 and now the
4th is in progress with a Sth to come. The Sth could fail so remain alert.

SWISS FRANC IMM

The Swiss Franc has acted more like a market which has reversed trend since its high
of January 8th at the 61.8% retracement of the previous major range.

So far a 50% retracement to the primary expansion has been recorded and it only took
7 days to retrace half of the net gains of the previous 6 months.

From the MAJOR 50% retracement the Franc then bounced back to exactly the 50%
retracement of the current previous INTERMEDIATE impulse wave. This market has
provided 3 perfect price opportunities in January to those who know what to look for.

The long-term trend is still bearish and a new low should be expected. If the low of
September 1991, $343 breaks, support exists at $333, $324, $318 and $305. The best
level out of all of these appears to be the $324.

The next important TIME CONVERGENCE falls on the 3rd February, 1992, then

The current minor trend position would suggest a possible retracement high to be
made on February 3rd. Look at levels $363.30, $364.50 & $365.50, ie., 0.618, 0.666 &
0.707. I cannot stress enough how important the 3rd of February is, if the market fails
to turn on this date expect the trend at this time to accellerate.

US T-BONDS UPDATE

Although it is still early days the correction in the CBOT T-BONDS to 101 11/32 ap-
pears to be complete as of 24th January. The January Digest gave the bullish targets
on a break above 105 20/32 as 114 8/32 (7% yield) and 123 (6.5% yield). It maybe that
some sideways activity is necessary prior to the next advance. This market is certainly
showing great opportunity for traders.

ANNOUCEMENTS TO v2.10 WAVE TRADER USERS

Modifications to the software have been completed so that 486 and NOTEBOOK
COMPUTERS can access the security key. This adjustment was required due to the
way these machines boot up their parallel port. Also the software has been modified to
allow users to select which port they wish to access their security key. For instance you
may have a number of keys which are incompatible and they require different ports to
save you the inconvenience of removing and replacing keys as you use each program.
Ports LPT1, 2, 3 & 4 are now available to use with the V2.10 package.

V2.10 & V2.10E now contains some new routines in the form of additions rather than
changes. Primarilly these are related to the use of SOLAR TIME in making future
time projections. Also a number of minor bugs have been eliminated from the UP-
DATE MODULE. These additions & alterations now come as part of the V2.10 pack-
age and will not be issued as an upgrade. To update your V210/e package will require
a modest fee of $50.00 to cover printing, disks, hand ng & postage. US & OVER-
SEAS citizens should apply to GANN/ELLIOTT EDUCATORS for new disks.

SEMINAR LOS ANGELES

A GEOMETRY OF MARKETS 2 day seminar with Bob Miner and myself is

BEAR MARKET IN STOCKS SEEMS IN-
EVITABLE

The current technical position for both the DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS and the
S&P 500 index is about as risky as it was back in September 1987, just before the
crash. That is not to say that we are expecting a repeat performance of October 19th,
1987, just that the current position of buyers versus sellers is so delically balanced we
can see no other outcome possible but an agonizing BEAR MARKET.

The ramifications of a sharemarket collapse in the USA, JAPAN and GREAT
BRITAIN will cause the greatest selloff in equities world wide ever immagined.

This activity will force the current bunkruptcy stock held by financiers to be flooded
into the market place.

The outcome will be devastating to those who hang around looking for a way out, only
lots of time and pain will ever cure the current predicament.

DON’T EXPECT THE MARKET TO
SAVE YOU, YOU CAN ONLY SAVE
YOURSELF. Tudor Jones.

| S&P 500 INDEX 1

Our headline was not written on a whim, I and other dedicated analysts share the same
opinion. There are so many technical explanations for this conclusion that they are im-
possible to mention here.

Let’s just recap the simple technical signals that could alert an astute technical analyst
to the weakness that has befallen this market.

First, since January 15th, 1992 the S&P 500 has failed to make any new highs when the
DJIA was attempting to move into new high ground. The S&P 500 timed out exactly to
the day in major proportion both in time and price. One we mentioned in our January
Digest was the price relationship between the rise in the index from the 1987 crash low
and the rise from the 11th October, 1990 low as a 1:1.618 relationship.

Secondly, the rise terminated 1 year to the day from the beginning of the rise at the
Jan 91 low.

Thirdly, the 15th Jan, 92 high occurred 1 and 1/2 years from the July 1990 high from
which a 20% decline occured into Oct 1990.

Fourthly, there were many other important supporting TCR (time cycle ratios) which
clustered on and around the 15th January, 1992

Something I have not mentioned is that the same points, ie., Oct 87, Oct 90 and Jan 92
registered a 1.618:0.618 time relationship, also the 1974 low of the DJIA lies ona
1.618 to the 4th power time relationship with the 1987 crash low and the other two im-
portant points, ie., Oct 87 low, Oct 90 low and the Jan 92 high are in exact harmon
with the 1974 low. The calculations cannot be demonstrated here as they are forbidden
by our NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT, that is the one we have between special
students we teach these finer points of market timing to in our $5000 four day
workshops.

Suffice to say we are sharing our knowledge with you by stating the importance we at-
tach to this event.

COMEX GOLD

The long-term trend is still bearish and a new low should be expected. If the low of
September 1991, $343 breaks, support exists at $333, $324, $318 and $305. The best
level out of all of these appears to be the $324.

The next important TIME CONVERGENCE falls on March 30 as per the February
Digest but, now time has been overbalanced between the June 10 high and the Sep 11
low I have removed the lesser degree swings of Apr 29 and Jun 10. This wave analysis
projects April 3rd as the most likely date for a change in trend in the intermediate de-
gree wave action. Be especially alert during the week ending 3rd April, 1992 for a
price and pattern signal day that could represent a tradable move.

SOYBEANS - JULY CONTRACT

Since my recent trip to the US I have been following the SOYBEAN complex due to
the interest in the potential "El Nino" effect. Many analysts have forecast the pos-
sibility of a BULL MARKET occurring this year or next. I once had the pleasure in
1983 to be on the long side of an explosive bull market in beans, it was an experience
you could never forget. For this reason I am closely watching the bean market for sig-
nals that may alert me to another "explosive bull market". Up until now the July
Soybean contract has been acting in a purely technical manner. Just a few days back it
once again hesitated its advance at the 0.618 price retracement in 0.618 of time of the
previous range. If it continues to break resistance as it has in the past it won’t be lon

efore we see some "BULLISTIC ACTION". I have included this month a chart of the
contract price and the WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY calculations using the waves
outlined on the price chart. If you are a bean follower watch the dates highlighted for
potential change in trend dates.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO WAVE TRADER USERS and
INFORMATION SEEKERS

WAVE TRADER SOFTWARE, THE GEOMETRY OF MARKETS BOOK & THE
GEOMETRY OF MARKETS WORKSHOP NOTES WITH AUDIO TAPES will be
available exclusively from our US distributor.

GANN / ELLIOTT EDUCATORS.

All questions regarding sales, installation, operation and technical advice should be ad-
dressed to our distributors principal Mr ROBERT MINER (unless otherwise arranged
with me in advance). In the event that he has no answer I will endeavour to provide
one; so long as it only has to do with software application.

In 1986 when I sold the first copy of the WAVE TRADER to a fellow trader I made it
quite clear that my program was a TOOL BOX to replicate GANN and ELLIOTT
oriented market analysis. I said at the time that it was up to him to learn the theory be-
hind the routines that we use. I still hold the same position today.

In 1989 I published the "GEOMETRY OF MARKETS" book, to help outline aspects
of the theory of time and price analysis, so that people interested in this superior form
of market assessment could educate themselves in their own time.

Now due to the sophistication employed by the WAVE TRADER V2.10e version that
has been in circulation since May 1991, it has become necessary to provide specialized
training in the form of seminars. These seminars have been taped and contain impor-
tant technical material never published before. The latest seminar held in LAX 29th
February, 1992 is currently being edited and will be available for sale quite soon. The
price for the tapes and the 200 page seminar manual is $395.

For students seeking services such as personal training in the art of TECHNICAL
ANALYSIS OF MARKETS and TRAINING IN THE PROCEDURAL USE OF
THE WAVE TRADER I have two programs available. For novice analysts I recom-
mend they start with the 2 day instruction workshop undertaken in small groups. I will
begin to hold these once again in the near future. The cost will be a modest $850 per
person.

For the professional analyst and trader who wishes to be shown the LEADING EDGE
in market timing, including the use of planetary cycles, I will be conducting a four day
intensive course from time to time. Participants will be required to sign NON-DIS-
CLOSURE AGREEMENTS and agree that the knowledge transfered will only be
used for their own personal benefit. The cost of this course is $5000. Students taking
this course will leave realizing which tools and techniques work, why they work and
when and how to use them. The techniques taught in this course are applicable to all
markets, not just one or two. Twelve years of research knowledge transferred in 4 days.

THE PRIMARY BULL MARKE#T IN
THE US$ WHICH BEGAN IN JANUARY
IS EXHAUSTED

On the Spring equinox, friday, 20th March, 1992 a major rally in the
Deutsche Mark, Swiss Franc and the British Pound began. The Deutsche
Mark reversal accompanied classic technical signals of time and price
convergence. These signals and how to work them into the future will be
the main subject of our discussion this month.

A new bear market in the US$ will be confirmed by the British Pound trading above

1.23, the Swiss Franc above 68.50 or below 1.46 and the D-Mark above 61.8 or below

The D-Mark is the safest investment out of the three currencies, it also pays a good in-
terest rate, if you are buying physical currency concentrate on this one.

US STOCK INDICES CONTINUE TO
GENERATE SELL SIGNALS WHILST
THE US BOND MARKET FINDS
SUPPORT

A divergence between the accepted theory, ie., stocks go up in a low interest rate en-
vironment is going to be tested throughout 1992 as the deflationary trend continues.

The only safe haven for investors this year is going to be in cash even with low rates,

anyone who thinks the recession is over is going to get a real lesson in economics
throughout 1992-1993.

Who out there caught the DEUTSCHE MARK making a 61.8% Price retracement in
38.2% of Time of a major range. This was an especially important event as it fell on
the 20th March, 1992 equinox (exactly to the day).

The Gold market and the currency markets often make seasonal highs and lows close

to the EQUINOXES and SOLSTICES, ie., around March 18-24, September 19-26 and

June 19-2; December 19-25. Also important are the Apogee July 2-8 and the Perigee

FEATURE - predicting future time rhythm |

In recent months I’ve come into contact with numerous WAVE TRADER USERS
who are new to TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS. Many expressed having doubts as to
how they should interpret and filter the strength of time signals produced within the
a TI TEMPLATE of the UPDATE SWING CHARTS module and the HIGH
ORING DAYS generated by the WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY module?

Before you can personally filter any WAVE TRADER signal for its tradable value you
need to understand the theory and practical application of TIME ANALYSIS. I’ve _
often stated at seminars and private student sessions that it is possible to generate time
vibration signals for just about everyday of the year. In essence these signals will be
nothing more than just RANDOM calculations unless certain other criteria is present.

THE FIRST STEP when projecting TCR’s (Time aecle Ratios of a measured move) is
to look for MULTIPLE S GNALS OR CLUSTERS falling on a particular date. THE
NEXT STEP is to look for RHYTHM. The professional time analyst knows that the ©

revious vibrations are just as important as the future vibrations, knowing this they will
ook fora RHYTHM between the PAST & the FUTURE.

A Rhythm is present when say a high or low forms on a TCR of a measured move,
lets say a ratio of 0.382; then at a later time a new high or low forms on a ratio in the
same progression of ratios, eg., 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 1.000, 1.618, 2.000 etc.,

You have to use these tools in the same manner as the raw calculations. The stronger
signals will be formed when you find MULTIPLE RHYTHMS at work within a com-
plex. When you have the knowledge of how to find out if these conditions exist, the
odds of forecasting future trend change dates will increase significantly. The best way
to get this knowledge is to study past market turning points. I find the CYCLE &
STARWARS routines in the ATE SWING C TS module, the fastest and
most time efficient way to complete this task.

To give you an example of how one should approach this type of time analysis we need
to look at a before situation and then a future probability arrived at with a reference to
the past.

The past example I am using is the DEUTSCHE MARK IMM 1ST MONTH FU-
TURES LOW 58.55 ON THE 20th MARCH, 1992. (see upper chart next page). The
first important observations are the top three TCR ratios, 0.382, 0.500 & 1.000. These
ratios are all common to the January 8th, 1992 high and the progressive lows starting
at the July 2nd, 1991 low. At the same time a rhythm developed in the decline, ie.,
2.000 & 1.414. There are a number of longterm TCR’s not illustrated here that also
fell on the date of this low (920320).

For the future we now look for a DATE where a continuation of the same rhythms
come into phase once again. (See lower chart next page? In this case I have tested for
rhythm on the 13th April, 1992. The 0.382 moves to 0.500, the 0.500 moves to 0.667,
1,000 moves to 1.333. From the decline we pick out that the 1.414 (root 2) moves to
2.236 root 5), 2.000 moves to 3.142 (22/7 PI). Then the new ranges come in at 0.333
and 0.382.

All quality time signals will generate some influence over the progression of a trend.
The over-riding influence will then be the PRICE level a market reaches when these
time vibrations fall due. For instance given the fall into the 920320 low as a three wave
0.618 retracement of the previous PRIMARY degree trend, any retracement over and
above 0.382 (normal 4th wave limitation) of the fall would indicate a possible primary
degree trend change. Using the knowledge of how it all fell together in the past is a
primary analysis asset for the future.

WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW A MARKET HAS BEEN PROGRESS-
ING, FILTERING HIGH PROBABILITY SIGNALS GENERATED BY MECHANI-
CAL MEANS IS ONLY A LUCKY GUESS.

The mistake is not in guessing wrong, the mistake is in staying wrong .........

EDITORIAL

There is no bull side or bear side to the market - only the right side. Bull and Bear are
just descriptions from which we can identify our opinions. Even though I hold an
opinion right now, I am flexible enough to reverse it if evidence comes along that sug-
gests I should. The purpose of this digest is to show others how to think for themsel-
ves, not just force feed my opinion on you. If you can learn how to conduct a com-
prehensive analysis of any market in an average of 5 minutes a day as I can, then you
will learn how to remain flexible, patient and self opinionated. Just remember to main-
tain your humility and you won’t get into any trouble, infact you will be at ease to
trade without fear or greed motivating you to second guess your position.

It is common knowledge that I work very closely with a coup

who write their own newsletters. Sometimes we can hold di

longer-term pers

le of prominent analysts
fering views about the
ective of certain markets, this is a normal situation, due to the fact

we are individuals. Nevertheless it should be known, if some evidence that is important
to our individual views arises we have the ability to fax it immediately we see it. Often
it is not necessary because we are all flexible and know what market action constitutes

a change in opinion.

It should be everyone’s aim who works with technical analysis to study and reacha |
professional level; why settle for anything less. When you can duplicate the top of this

page in an hour you have made the grade.
NEWS CLIP -I have it on good authori

that as of October the Texas two step will be

banned after midnite at Harry’s Bar in Pismo Beach, California. In fact all music and
dancing will be banned after midnite. Harry’s is a real throw back to the past, it is a
place where you can go and revisit the 70’s, right in the middle of town. Anyone who
as been to Pismo and not visited Harry’s doesn’t know what they have missed. You
can rub shoulders with bikers and cowboys all having a good time and oblivious to any

normal predudice; Just the tonic for exhausted commodi

traders. The place will

never be the same once the local council gets its way. WHAT’s NEXT?

USA STOCK MARKET SET TO MAKE
IT OR BREAK IT THIS MONTH!

The current DIVERGENCE between the S&P500 and the DOW JONES
INDUSTRIAL AVERAGES must be resolved before any confirmation of a
continuing bull market in stocks can be contemplated.

When the DJIA made a new all time high on the 16th April, 1992 the
S&P500 refused to move anywhere near its all time high made on 15th
January, 1992,

The broad market is lagging the blue chip stocks, ie., the DJIA is making
new history highs whilst the S&P500 refuses to move into new ground. If
the S&P500 cannot move into new high ground this month the short side
(or right side) could be extremely volatile.

FURTHER CUTS IN SHORT TERM USA
INTEREST RATES DOUBTFUL

US Treasury Bill rates look to have made INTERMEDIATE DEGREE
lows in recent times, with little prospect for rises this market is a trading
range proposition in the near term.

The US-T BOND / T-BILL YIELD SPREAD is currently fluctuating
around 4 basis points. This is historically high therefore we expect the
long rates (T-BOND) to get weaker in the near future and the spread to
narrow.

DIVERGENCES IN PRICE ACTION BETWEEN THINGS OF A SIMILAR NA-

TURE SAN GIVE ADVANCE WARNINGS OF AN IMPENDING CHANGE IN

If you look at how the S&P 500 prices were making lower highs and lower lows prior

to the explosive rally between the 9th and 16th April you can identify a distribution
taking place.

A distribution occurs when strong hands sell into weaker hands. The buying by the

weaker hands is not sufficiently powerful enough to force prices to new highs. SUPP-
LY OUTWEIGHS DEMAND.

Rallies within distributions are aided by short covering from the professionals. This is
the picture being painted by the S&P 500 index.

Given the historical overvaluation of US industrial stocks at this time and the technical

picture being presented it is only reasonable to anticipate a bear market of primary de-
gree.

GOLD STILL LOSING ITS GLISTER

New 6 year price lows amid a low interest rate environment only
re-inforces the critical situation this complex is facing. Production of new
gold has yet to taper off, although it will do so quite soon if the
downtrend in prices continue much longer. Definitely not the time to
invest just yet.

Some months back I mentioned that JUNE 22nd, 1992 may be an
important date for the GOLD complex this year. As we approach the
summer solstice I will be looking for trend and pattern signals that
coincide with some price supports I have outlined above.

INVEST WITH YOUR HEAD NOT YOUR HEART........ |

An examination of the methods employed by successful stock market
traders, shows first that they are persons who do their own thinking, and
secondly, that their success is not mere chance but instead is the result of

arduous and careful study of market conditions.

| Predicting future time rhythm - DEUTSCHE MARK |
Continued from April...

Knowing why, where & when a strong reversal signal is being generated will be the
only way to capitalize on your technical analysis.

In the April issue we discussed the existing time rhythms present in the DEUTSCHE

MARK and illustrated how these vibrations would coincide again on the 13th April,

Well the 13th April,1992 arrived and went without this market making an extreme high
or low on that day! You may ask the question as to why this was the case?

The simple answer is this; the market price and trend was not in a confirmatory posi-
tion when the time was up. If the time signal was to be validated then the price
relationships would have needed to coincide with the time signal.

This does not mean that one should disregard these existing rhythms, we should con-
tinue to monitor them and other important ranges in the future.

Looking back on my comments in the April Digest about the strength of the DMARK
one has to be a little wary due to the deep correction, ie., 0.786 of the rally out of the
March 20 low. At the same time the SWISS FRANC went and made a new low below
its March 20 bottom.

There are some quite strong time convergence dates for the DMARK falling in May
the first of which is the 3/4th and the second of which are the 12/13th. The Swiss Franc
has a particularly strong time window between the 19th/22nd May. The week ending
22nd May falls on a rhythm vibration that has been extremely good this past year.

BY THE WAY...

About the middle of April many of the markets I follow acted in a manner that did not
conspire confidence in their short term direction. As a result I have sidelined myself
for the time being whilst I await signals that will "jump off the chart" and give me a
solid base from which to trade.

For this reason I thought it would be appropriate to remind readers of a few familiar
sayings.

When in doubt stay out.....
Live to fight another day.....
No position is a position......

If the minimum potential reward cannot be estimated to at least 3 times the risk then the
trade is not worth entering......

Rome was not built in a day.....
There are bold traders and old traders but, there are very few old bold traders.....

The reason I do the analysis I do is to look for set up trades - nothing more, nothing
less. If I can’t see a set up then I might as well ‘do some research or go to lunch, it’s
much less aggravating.

DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS REACHES
ITS LIMIT ?

At this moment we don’t know for sure but, the price activity over the
long term picture certainly has reached alarming proportions.
The June 2nd High of 3435.2 has come within 10 points of several
dynamic price objectives.

1987 crash wave expansion of 1.618
1990 bear market expansion of 1.618
and

the rise from 11th October 1990 low 2434 to 3435.2 is 38.2% of all gains
since the 1974 low of 570.

The DJIA rose 987 points (Fibonacci expansion) from the 14th January 1991 low. This
is the low day prior to the war against Irak. The S&P500 has still not made a new high
from January this year. The broard market is still diverging with the blue chips.

The WAVETRADER TREND WAVES are showing exhaustion in the upwards trend.

IMPORTANT BUT NOT ILLUSTRATED... The time elapsed from the July 1990
high is one Mars solar year. The time duration from the 11th October 1990 low is half
that of the time back to the crash low 1987 when measured in Jupiter solar degrees.

May 19th, 1992 saw both the US T-BILL and the BRITISH POUND make inter-
mediate degree highs. The bill contract traded to an historic high. Bills are expressed
as a value out of 100. 1% = 99,2% = 98,3% = 97 and so forth. It’s interesting to
note that over the past 6 months both of these contracts have turned simultaneously.
Now piven the relatively high overbought position of the RELATIVE STRENGT
INDEX one could expect the BRITISH POUND RALLY TO BE EXHAUSTED. If
not then it has only one more advance left before a sizable decline.

The implication attached to the comparison of the T-Bill rate and the Pound is that if
the US rates have declined as far as they are going to, then, the currency relationship

should improve in the US$ favor as the UK reduces its interest rates (these are still at
extremely high levels compared with the US).

The time signals, at the May 19 high, provided by the SWING CHART ANALYSIS
module show a high degree of dynamic time convergence, on primary ratios. Swing
Point 0 corresponds to a double top with Point 2 and is also at the 0.618 level of 1991
bear market range. Draw your own conclusions.

July beans is showing all the signs for a trend reversal of intermediate degree. The clas-
sic divergence with the RSI after completing 5 minor waves in a trend is the first warn-
ing signal for a reversal.

The above coupled with the price activity of the MAJOR WAVES would lead me to
believe that at least an INTERMEDIA E DEGREE correction is now in progress.

IMPORTANT SEASONAL DATES DUE

In the month of June and July there are two important times to watch on
a seasonal basis.

June 21st this year is the the SUMMER SOLSTICE.

This is the date that the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky in the Northern
hemisphere - the longest hours of daylight.

July 3/6 is the approximate time for the Earths APOGEE with the Sun.

The apogee occurs once each year as the Earth reaches its furtherest distance from the
Sun in its eliptical orbit.

Also this month between the SOLSTICE & the APOGEE we will
experience a SOLAR ECLIPSE on the NEW MOON of June 30.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are directly in a straight line.
When this event happens the Moon blocks out the Suns rays at some location on the
Earth. This cycle occurs regularly every six lunar months or once each 177 days.

Watch these dates carefully for most commodities, stocks and currencies. When impor-
tant DYNAMIC TIME VIBRATIONS of individual markets coincide with seasona
dates important change in trend can be indicated.

EDITORIAL

Most observers of this newsletter might get the idea that we are continually bearish
regarding the position of world stock markets. This is certainly our position. Now more
than ever it is important that you don’t fall for the brokers rhetoric and start buying
out of frustration, that is unless you are a trader who reviews his positions daily. WID
is still maintaining a cash position. Stocks at present are a no win investment vehicle.

Stay 100% in cash until such time as POSITIVE VALUE re-enters the market.

US $ CONFIRMS MAJOR
DOWNTREND ?

Price action by the BRITISH POUND and DEUTSCHE MARK in the
past month suggest another major bear market in progress for the US$.

If technical time calculations in the next month fail to signal a reversal of
the US$ downtrend it will possibly continue the current trend for another
3 to 6 months.

A certain confirmation will be a breakout by the SWISS FRANC above
the January 8th, 1992, 0.618 retracement of the previous primary degree
bear trend.

DATA - From 671231 to 928320 Sts 5 [ESC to EXIT]

The current pattern in the DEUTSCHE MARK chart is extremely BULLISH since a
recent break above the January 8th, 1992 high;considering the 20th March, 1992 low
was a 0.618 retracement of the prior range of similar degree. If this current wave is a
THIRD WAVE it has the potential to really rocket on from these levels. So far there
has been no evidence (technically) of a minor 4th wave correction in the current run.
For this reason I have to stick with the current trend until I can identify a MAJOR
TOP. On the following page I have detailed the upcoming dates that are important to
watch for price and pattern activity if a reversal is to occur.

COMEX - GOLD

For the past couple of months we have been quiet on gold. The main reason has been
because we have had unqualifyable price patterns which we could not especially relate
to the time activity fora MAJOR CHANGE OF TREND.

We are still not convinced a MAJOR LOW has been made, irrespective of the current
rally that has unfolded since April 29th. Just the same a few WAVETRADER’s (we
respect their opinion) who have contacted us in recent times seem to think a new bull
market is in progress. As I said I am not that confident but, I will take this page to ex-

lain the resistance levels I would need to see broken before becoming overall bullish

or the longer-term.

A $16.30 rally in 10 weeks does not really look very bullish to us. Just the same one
needs to set some warning parameters should this rally in progress continue and break
what we perceive to be strong overhead resistance.

The low made on April 29 at $334.90 did have sufficient time and price squarings for
an INTERMEDIATE DEGREE change in trend, We calculated April 29 as an impor-
tant time in the INTERMEDIATE DEGREE waves in the January WTD. In the _
primary or cycle degree the $334.90 level was exactly 33.3% discount to the 1987 high
and 1.618 in time from the 1985 low of the decline from September 1980.

Just the same the rally in progress would need to go above $ 375 by a few dollars
before we would think the current price activity is anything but an INTERMEDIATE
DEGREE RALLY in a continuing bear market.

The accompanying chart shows the retracement levels from the August 1990 high to
the April 1992 low. The 50% level at $375 exceeds all of the downtrend lines. It would
take a break of this level for us to reconsider our long term position.

This market should be watched carefully because a break of the long term trend could
offer an exceptional investment for patient investors.

US T-BONDS 8% COUPON - CBOT

The short term picture for T-Bonds looks bearish after the daily reversal pattern on
Friday 10th July. Friday was exactly 180 degrees (1/2 solar year) from the January high.
Many of the other wave pivots have timed out on solid ratios in divisions of a year.
The wave structure in the advance from 920323 (the orthodox low, which was a 0.618
retracement in 0.382 of time in the previous intermediate degree advance) has been
very weak in structure and has the appearance of being corrective.

EDITORIAL

This past week in OZ saw official interest rates cut by 0.75% down to 5.75% (from a
peak of 18% January 1990) and the government statisticians release of the June un-
employment 11.1%.

Every state has unemployment above 10%, the worst has 12.5%. This country’s
economic future is teetering on the edge. We are in the very serious position of sliding
down the scale to the level of countries such as Mexico and Argentina.

The blowout in the 1991/92 budget deficit by 100% and the loss in value of the
Australian dollar to the JYEN, DMARK, SWISS FRANC and BRITISH POUND are
the consequence of bad economic management. This trend has the effect of lowering
our standard of living and selling off the farm.

The current trend is still hard down; the economy will continue to worsen before there
are any "bankable" signs of recovery.

The person responsible for econonomic and monetary policy in the boom times and
"the recession we had to have" has graduated to Prime Minister. Now he’s leading
another bunch of "yes men" with the resolve to continue administering the same
medicine which led us into this predicament.

Once this country held equal opportunity for everyone. Until there is a total reform
from the overgoverning bureaucratic mess we have slipped into this situation will
never return.

I first warned of a RECESSION and/or DEPRESSION about to befall our economy
back in early 1989. If I could see it coming why couldn’t thie "experts" who are paid to
formulate government policy? The only answer can be, we don’t have the right people
in our government, until we do we can expect more of the same.

GOLD BEAR MARKET IS STILL ALIVE
AND WELL.

Lower highs, lower lows, sharp declines after every rally high.
Rallies terminating on intermediate time cycles indicate that the current
market activity is still well entrenched in its present long term bear
market.

The July issue of WTD issued a warning to the bulls based on a logical
analysis of the recent past. The Windows of Opportunity report nailed the
20th July (the last rally high day) as a high probability date for a reversal
of trend. So far the market is indicating a new bear phase in progress.

Were you prepared to believe the technical indicators?

COMPOSITE TIME COUNTS

In modern days composite time counts have been popularized by students of EL-
LIOTT WAVE and GANN WORKS.

A trend change could occur at precise time intervals counted from previous market
pivot points.

DIVISIONS AND MULTIPLES OF A YEAR

0.236, 0.25, 0.333, 0.382, 0.50, 0.618, 0.667, 0.707, 0.75, 0.786, 0.833, 0.875, 1.000, 1.272,
Lai, 19). 1618, 1.732, 1.75, 2.000, 2.236, 2.50, 2.618, 3.000, 3.33, 4.000, 4.236, 5.00,
.00 and 6.854,

From thereon be aware of anniversaries from important major trend change pivots.

FIBONACCI SERIES

The most common counter series used today is the FIBONACCI SERIES of numbers.
Anyone familiar with R.N. Elliott's WAVE PRINCIPLE will be aware of the impor-
tance attached to this series, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987
and so forth with each future number maintaining a 1.618 relationship to its predeces-
sor.

Counts can be performed in TRADING DAYS, CALENDAR DAYS, SOLAR
DEGREES, EKS, MONTHS and even YEARS.

Multiples and squares of the Fibonacci series, such as:-

34 68, 102, 136, 170, 204, 238.
55 110, 165, 220, 275, 330, 385.
89 178, 267, 356, 445, 534, 623.
144 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008.
233 466, 699, 932, 1165

13 squared = 169

21 squared = 441

34 squared = 1156

55 squared = 3025

Some of these numbers can be arrived at by diffent means for instance 238 calendar
days = 34 weeks, 385 a master number in days = 55 weeks. 3025 a master number in
days = 432 weeks.

NATURAL POWERS OF NUMBERS

3 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187.
4 16, 64, 256, 1024.

5 25, 125, 625, 3125.

6 36, 216, 1296.

7 49, 343, 2401.

Yr’

ve highlighted the medium term counts I’ve seen occur regularly in calendar days.

46
August 1992 WAVE TRADER DIGEST Volume 3 Issue 8

LUCAS NUMBER SERIES

These numbers have the same properties as the Fibonacci series in so far as each suc-
cessive number in the series relates to its predecessor by the ratio of 1.618.

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364, et cetera.

These numbers can have a dynamic relationship with the Fibonacci series of numbers.
For instance 322 divided by 144 results in 2.236 or V/S. (2.236 = + /¢)

There are other numbers we could place importance on for composite time counts,
these are mentioned in the appendices under Ancient Numerology.

WHAT CONSTITUTES A VALID COMPOSITE COUNT SIGNAL ?

The most reliable COMPOSITE TIME SIGNALS I have experienced are when you
pt a combination of DIVISIONS OF A YEAR together with FIBONACCI or
UCAS COUNTS in days and weeks. Weekly time counts are extremely reliable.

The reason for this is due to the fact that these counts will form dynamic time relation-
ships between the various market pivot points and the current point where you are ex-
pecting an exhaustion of trend.

For instance a termination of trend is more likely to occur when you have multiple
counts from a series of previous market pivots. I‘normally check the past 8 INTER-
MEDIATE DEGREE market pivots for COMPOSITE TIME COUNTS before worry-
ing about pivots further afield.

When calculating composite counts you should allow for some under or over shooting
of the ideal number. A difference of 1% is not uncommon. Here is an example of
some composite counts I saw when the JAPANESE YEN made high on July 2, 1992.

BRITISH POUND

The charts below illustrate the technical indicators present in the IMM BRITISH
POUND contract. Strong time signals in the primary and intermediate degree fell at
the recent high. Trend indicators have now turned to indicate a high probability for an
intermediate degree downtrend. The slow trend wave is now below the center line.
The 10/20 day moving averages are about to cross to a bear signal. The RSI has shown

The vicious bear trend in progress from the June high has decimated any bulls planing
to pet rich on a summer rally in beans! Just now, as all hope of a bull market appears
to be out of the question, one should look carefully at all the technical indicators.

The trend indicators are now signalling a potential for a reversal of trend. Let the fol-
lowing charts help guide you to a possible reversal either now or about the 16th
August, 1992.

US EQUITY MARKETS

LAST MONTH:

We are still convinced that a major downtrend in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones In-
dustrials is in progress. In the past 5 weeks the S&P 500 has failed to make new
ground. Every S&P 500 major rally has ended in lower highs since the JANUARY

THIS MONTH:

Our observations in recent times have been "less than correct", the S&P 500 recently
went on to make a marginally higher high than that of January.

Although we are still "OVERALL" bearish in regards this market we cannot claim "to
have a hold" on the day to day or even the week to week progress. We cannot explain
this in simple terms because there are obviously many COMPLEX factors influencing
this market other than the technical signals we are monitoring. These reasons could
have to do with the "election year" or the fact that too few other markets are offering a
clear attraction to move investors away from stocks.

Sometimes a total failure to predict the short term and even the medium term trend
can occur because too many influences, which are undetectable from technical means,
are prevalent within a market complex. This certainly appears to be the case right now.
Although we recognize that our view has little to do with day to day trading we often
hold out a view that would advantage our readers. Because of our recent failures we
recommend technical traders to take a "stand aside" position until the technical picture
becomes a whole lot clearer.

NEVERTHELESS I WOULD STILL WARN THE BULLS OF AN EXPLOSIVE
MOVE TO THE DOWNSIDE AS A REAL POSSIBILITY.

The recent high in the S&P 500 fell on a 0.382 TIME CYCLE PROJECTION of the
1974-1987 bull market range time.

The Australian dollar has been decimated in value to the British Pound, Swiss Franc,
Deutsche Mark and the Japanese Yen. NOW we are about to witness a complete
breakdown in our international standing if the A$ breaks support with the US$. The
long line of support between 73 and 74 cents is now being tested. The Reserve bank
has thrown everything short of the "kitchen sink" at it to support these levels. Any
break below 73 would indicate they have lost the battle.

Who remembers this saying, “Will the last business person leaving Australia please
switch off the lights". Looks like this saying (relevant to the 1982 recession) is about to
be resurrected once again.

The government policies have failed to create a sound economic environment for IN-
VESTMENT WHICH WILL CREATE JOBS. Instead they insist on retraining
people, at the tax payers expense, for jobs that will never exist. Or trying to stimulate
the economy with consumer spending! How in their right mind could they consider
that a consumer led recovery is possible when you have official unemployment at 11%

(the true figure is more likely close to 17%).

The monthly IMM Japanese Yen chart below would indicate that a 5th
wave of cycle degree is in progress.

This chart has recently been making slightly higher highs and progressive
higher lows since the April 1990 correction low.

If the 1987 high 83.40 or 120 yen is taken out we can expect the next cycle
target to be PARITY, ie., 1OOYEN to US$ 1.00

JAPANESE YEN

I have been watching the Japanese currency closely over the past two years with inter-
est. Although I’ve had my suspicions the indicators are now very much in favor for a
continuation of the strengthening Yen to US$.

The latest measures by the Japanese government to stimulate their economy are a
strong contributing economic factor that could influence this outcome.

Another factor worth considering is the fact that the JAPANESE SHARE MARKET
has taken its medicine by declining over 60% in value from its late 1989 high.

In the past few weeks the NIKKEI INDEX has rebounded nearly 25% in value. The at-
traction for investors to move back into Japanese stocks could provide the necessary
DEMAND for JAPANESE YEN to fuel the current bull trend.

Prognosis is to buy into weakness, ie., buy the corrections.

JAPANESE STOCK MARKET

The bear market in Japanese stocks could have terminated. A fall in value of 63.6%
(ratio of the Great Pyramid’s height to base, ie., 1.272 to 2.000 = 0.636).

Time from the 1989 high to the current low is slightly more than 2.618 years.
Whichever way you look at it the Japanese share market represents the best value of
all the world equity markets.

COMEX GOLD FUTURES |

Last month we indicated the perilous position of the Gold market. Since the collapse
to a new Six year low on the 13th August we still remain bearish to this market in the
Intermediate degree.

Presently it would appear only another minor degree bear market rally is in progress,
it may have terminated on the 31st August, if not the 0.500 and the 0.618 retracements
should act as strong resistance in the near future.

For our BEARISH opinion to change we would need to see one of two things occur.
e Market rallies from here above the July 20 high.

° Market collapses into a very strong time cycle convergence.

The RSI OVERSOLD READING at the 13th August low would normally only indi-
cate a 3rd wave bottom with another thrust on the downside to come.

The SLOW TREND WAVE is now rotating upwards, for a confirmation of a bull
market trend I would need to see it rise ABOVE THE ZERO LINE.

NOVEMBER SOYBEANS

The slide which began on June 2 this year reached significant support early last month,
1 day after the WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY signal day.

Presently we are monitoring the unfolding reaction, mainly BECAUSE almost every
fundamental source we have come into contact with has the view that a rally in beans
will not begin until next year.

As we stated in the August issue of WTD it was time to begin to look for a change of
trend. So far the current market activity has allowed the trend indicators to move from
extremely bearish to POTENTIALLY BULLISH.

° The SLOW TREND WAVE is now above the ZERO LINE.
° The 10/20 DAY MOVING AVERAGE CROSSOVER is now bullish.
e The RSI 10 day is above 50 and rising.

A possible confirmation for a continyation in the potentially bullish move will be sig-
nalled by a break out above the 557°" cent high of August 25.

Soybeans are a seasonal commodity and it is important to watch for reactions to trend
on the EQUINOXES and SOLSTICES as well as APOGEE and PERIGEE.

New moons and Solar eclipses are also important cycle events to monitor.

Our research does not show any ALARMING TIME CYCLE RATIOS for an INTER-
MEDIATE DEGREE CHANGE OF TREND falling in the next month and a half.

Presently all indications of trend are BULLISH.

EQUINOX AND SOLSTICE CYCLES

The equinox and solstice cycles are seasonal in nature. As the Earth revolves around
the Sun in an ecliptical path each year it rotates on its north-south axis 365.25 times.

The Earth’s axis is inclined to the vertical by 23.5°

Due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis the Sun appears to move backwards and
forwards in the sky over a one year period. This is why we have the seasons in reverse
between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.

THE SEASONS

Vernal equinox
March 21

Summer solstice
June 21

tee Winter solstice
Autumnal equinox December 21
September 23

If the Earth’s axis were upright, bringing midsummer to the
the Sun would pass directly over northern hemisphere, while the

axis is tilted in a fixed direction, December 21 the situation is
234° from the vertical. reversed, while spring and

On June 21, the north pole is autumn occur between these
inclined towards the Sun, times.

The four extreme cycle points are known as the Vernal equinox, Summer solstice,
Autumnal equinox and the Winter solstice.

If we measure the cycle (orbit around the Sun) as a 360° circle and use the Vernal
equinox for the begining 0° (this is the day of the year, when the apparent view in the
sky, the Sun crosses over the equator into the Northern hemisphere). The other points
are Summer solstice 90°, Autumnal equinox 180° and Winter solstice 270°.

The most interesting scientific fact, relevant to TIME ANALYSIS, is the relationship
between days and degrees as the seasons unfold.

From the Vernal equinox 0° to the Autumnal equinox 180°, exactly half a year in
planetary cycle terms, consumes 186 days. 6 more days than the 180° between the
Autumnal equinox to the Vernal equinox.

It is important to remind you that these seasonal dates each year have been used by an-
cient societies and religions to mark holidays and festivals.

Careful research will show that many markets have made Minor, Intermediate and

Primary degree trend reversal on these exact dates, far to many times to just be a ran-
dom coincidence.
