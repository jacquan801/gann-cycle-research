Introduction

W.D. Gann believed that the angular relationships of the planets produced both cycles
and prices and as these cycles/prices could be predicted out into the future because of
the planets perfect mathematical relationship.

At any time astrology is considered sceptically by most people so its not surprising that
Gann didn’t advertise the fact that astrology was his main forecasting tool

In this book I have taken his predictions and where ever possible complete sequences
of trades so that I could find the pattern that would reveal the secret of his method.

There are a lot of books written that claim that they know Ganns method. | think that
there are a lot of Gann like methods but I doubt if the were the ones he used.This is
why I decided to do an investigation based solely on what I could judge was factual eg
his personal charts and his public predictions and trades.

W.D. Ganns career spanned 53 years from 1902 until 1955 and during this time he
developed many techniques but when you read The Ticker interview it is obvious that
his trading technique was already developed by 1909 and so this means that we can
forget about any further methods that he used afterwards such as the master time
overlays etc.In this book we are only interested in the things we know he

used. Astrology is the beginning of everything as you will see by the analysis of his
amazing wheat prediction of 1909 and the link between his greatest discovery made on
August the 8th 1908 and the Lambert Gann emblem.

In this book you will see the same pattern revealed over and over again so there can be
no doubt that this was his method.

While you are reading it may be difficult initially if you have never looked at
astrology,not because of the concepts but because of the terminology and the planets
glyphs I have used the full name for everything instead of the shorthand where ever I
can because I want you to understand and recognise the pattern as quickly as you can.
Remember Gann often mentioned the circle (cycle) the square and the triangle soon
you will find out what he meant. ;

Also the moon plays a large part in the timing of events which is one of the points that
he was making in Tunnel thru the air.

It is always hard learning a new language for the first time be it music or chart
reading. The good thing from our point of view is that we are not concerned with any
astrological symbolism only the position of the planets as viewed from earth
(geocentric) You will need to refer to the glossary at the back but we are using three
terms mainly, the trine (triangle-120 degrees conjunct meaning joined together and
square meaning at a 90 degree angle.

This * is used in place of the degree sign eg there are 360* in a circle.

W.D.Gann and Astrology - The Proof.

To prove to you that Gann really did use the positions of the planets

I thought it would be interesting to take a look at Ganns actual price chart for May
Soybeans from the years 1948-1949 and see what techniques we could see him using
on the chart.

Top left is the astological symbol for the planet Jupiter just at the begining of a Jupiter
trendline(1) He started this trendline on the 4th of October 1948 when Jupiter was at
22 degrees Sagittarius. 22 degrees Sagittarius is also 262 degrees of the 360 degree
circle.Ganns first price marking was at 262 cents and then he started moving his
trendline up by 1 cent every time Jupiter moved by 1 degree.

The next interesting chart marking (2) is a line drawn along at 270 cents marking the
price/degree where Jupiter would change signs from Sagittarius to Capricorn.A planet
c ing signs of the zodiac is known as ingress and this chart shows several planets

ingress but he only marked Jupiters in then (4) Venus and—

Mars ingress within one day of each other.He put a little cross on the day of the Mars
crossing.

Each zodiac sign is 30 degrees of the circle. (360 degrees divided by 12 signs = 30
degrees) Gann marked 270 price for Jupiters ingress and then marked 15 cents below
this (5) as well 30 cents lower (6) all potential price targets.

Another interesting trendline is created by the movement of the planet Mars (7) Mars
moves faster than Jupiter and this is reflected in the steeper slope of the Mars trendline.
There are a few light markings that are hard to see in a reprint like this but one of
them (9) is a little arrow pointing down when the moons nodes changed to 29 degrees
of a new sign. This is like a planetary ingress because the moons nodes run counter
clockwise.

It is always fascinating to study this chart but planetary ingress was only a minor part
of Ganns techniques, more important are the actual predictions that Gann made in his
annual forecasts.

August 15th 1902 Gann makes his first trade.

Here are the first elements of the Gann formula.

1) A Trine.

2) A Conjunction involving the Trine.

3) Balanced aspects. That means the aspects aren’t exact but each aspect is not exact by the same
ammount.In this case the Sun is trine Uranus with a 4 * separation the Sun is also Conjunct
Mercury with a 4* separation.

Gann made one of his most important discoveries on August 8th 1908.

The clues Gann left are numerous but the most important are the triangle and the square.Have a
look at the emblem for the Lambert Gann publishing company and compare this with the chart for
August the 8th 1908.

This is the date that W.D.Gann says that he made one of his greatest discoveries

for predicting the trend of stocks and commodities. The similarities are obvious.

....In order to substantiate Mr.Gann’s claims as to what he has been able to do under this method
we Called upon Mr. William E. Gilley an Inspector of imports, 16 Beaver Street, New York.
Mr.Gilley is well-known in the downtown district. He himself has studied stock market
movements for twenty-five years during which time he has examined every piece of market
literature that has been issued and procurable in Wall Street. It was he who encouraged Mr.Gann
to study out the scientific and mathematical possibilities of the subject. When asked what had been
the most impressive of Mr. Gann’s work and predicitons he replied as follows:

“Mr.Gann’s calculations are based on natural law. I have followed his work closely for years. I
know that he has a firm grasp of the basic principles which govern stock market movements, and I
-do not believe any other man on earth can duplicate the idea or his method at the present time.

“Early this year he figures that the top of the advance would fall on a certain day in August and
calculated the prices at which the Dow-Jones averages would then stand. The market culminated
-on the exact day and-withiri four-tenths of one percent: of the figures predicted.”

You and Mr.Gann must have cleaned up considerable money on all these operations was
suggested. |

“Yes, we have made a great deal of money: He has taken half a million dollars out of the market
in the past few years. I once saw him take $130 and in less than one month run it up to over
$12,000. He can compound money faster than any man I ever met.”

So much for what Mr.Gann has said and done as evidenced by himself and others. Now as to
what demonstrations have taken place before our representative:

During the month of October, 1909, in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann made, in the presence
of our representative two hundred and eighty-six transactions in various stocks on both the long
and short side of the market. Two hundred and sixty-four of these transactions resulted in profits;
twenty-two in losses.

The capital with he operated was doubled ten times so that at the end of the month he has one
thousand per cent on his original margin.

In our presence Mr.Gann sold Steel common short at 94-7/8 saying that it would:not got to 95.
It did not.

On a drive which occurred during the week ending October 29 Mr.Gann bought Steel common at
86 1/4 saying that it would not go to 86. The lowest it sold was 86-1/8.

We have seen him give in one day sixteen successive orders in the same stock eight of which
turned out to be at either the top or the bottom eight of that particular swing. The above we can
positively verify. |

‘Such performances as these coupled with the foregoing are probably unparalleled in the history of
the Street.

Over the following pages you will learn how Gann made his predictions.

q

Shins

Wheat September 30th 1909.

This is probably one of Ganns most famous and most puzzling trades because it is
mentioned in The Ticker interview and no-one has been able to rationally solve it until
now.

“One of the most astonishing calculations made by Mr.Gann was during last summer
(1909) when he predicted that September wheat would sell at $1.20. This meant that it
must touch that figure before the end of the month of September. At twelve o’clock.
Chicago time, on September 30th (the last day) the option was selling below $1.08,
and it looked as though his prediction would not be fulfilled. Mr.Gann said “If it does
not touch $1.20 by the close of the market it will prove that there is something wrong
with my whole method of calculation. I do not care what the price is now, it must go
there.” It is common history that September wheat surprised the whole country by
selling at $1.20 and no higher in the very last hour of the trading closing at that
figure.”

Of all the aspects here the only one that we are interested in first is the trine.(Venus
trine Neptune) and from the trine conjunctions,squares or oppositions that can be

linked to the trine (Neptune square Saturn conjunct Moon and opposite Uranus.
‘So here we a powerful Tee square that is activated by the faster moving planet
Venus which is creating atrine to both a square and af Oppositiou.—=—S—=S=s=<CS

Ae trine is always the first aspect to look for as you will learn from the other proofs in

“” this book for the trine is the triangle or the one third ofa circle that Gann often

mentions.

Later you will learn in detail about price targets on the hexagon chart but the last low
on September wheat was 96.5 which is a straight line target to120(360*)

and $1.20 was Ganns forecast price for this day when powerful astro aspects were at
work.

The hexagram is the symbol of the planets in occult literature and is the most
important Gann tool for forecasting prices.

As you look at the planetary positions when cotton made various highs and lows you have to do
a double take they look so similar.The first chart is of a cotton high on 30th November 1923
Mercury was trine Neptune with a conjunction of Mars/Satum at the midpoint.

The next chart is a cotton low in 1953 Jupiter is trine Mercury with a conjunction of Mars/Venus

at the midpoint.

By now you will be able to see the basic pattern of aspects involving the trine.One or more of the
planets that are involved in the first part of the move (in this case the high) will algo be involved in
the low.

When Cotton made its high on September 8 1952 the trine was Jupiter/Sun with Jupiter conjunct

the moon is also making an exact square with Venus so we have again the triangle and the
square.Pluto is the major planet in the trine.Notice that the high on 2 April 1954 once again
involved Pluto but in a grand trine of Pluto/Mars/Venus.At the high Pluto is also in perfect
balance at the midpoimt of a Jupiter/Neptune trine.

This is a lunar return of sorts.The earth goes 360* around the Sun and it is called an anniversary
date.In this example the Moon is back in the same position compared to Neptune as it was the
month before when the low was made.Now in this whole sequence of trades don’t forget that
Neptune is the key planet and the fast moving planets act as a trigger to the slower moving
aspects.

Cotton high November 30th 1923.

This is the trade where Gann took an account that he opened on the day of the high with $973
and turned it into $30.000 by the time he closed the account on January 28th 1924.Lets look at
why he sold the high and closed the account when he did.

The price high was 2 points from the target created by the hexagram midpoint.(target 367 actual
high 365)

Here is the astrology of the high. Venus trine Neptune with a conjunction of Saturn/Mars at the
midpoint.(part Hexagram) Saturn and Mars are 2 points from the high using the hexagon chart.
The day he closed the account Venus again featured as part of a trine.this time a grand trine
Venus conjunct Uranus trine Pluto and Saturn conjunct Moon.

W.D.Gann has scored another astounding hit in his 1922 stock forecast issued in December 1921.
That forecast called for first top of the bull wave in April, second top in August, and the final top
and culmination of the bull market October 8 to 15, and strange as it may seem, the average prices
of twenty industrial stocks reached the highest point on October 14 and declined 10 points in
thirty days after that date.

Mr.Gann predicted a big decline for the month of November. He said in the 1922 forecast:
‘November 10-14 panicky break.” During this period stocks suffered a severe decline, many
falling 10 points or more in four days and on November 14 lowest average prices were made with
1,500,000 shares traded in on the New York Stock Exchange.

I found his 1921 forecast so remarkable that I secured a copy of his 1922 stocks forecast in order
to prove his claims for myself. And now, at the closing of the current year of 1922, it is but justice
to say I am more than amazed by the result of Mr. Gann’s remarkable predictions based on pure
science and mathematical calculations.

The North Side News stands for a clean Wall Street and has rendered a great public service in
helping to rid Wall Street of the bucket shop evil by publishing a series of articles in conjunction
with the Magazine of Wall Street. We believe in branding a fake, and we believe in giving credit
where due.

GANN NO TIPSTER

Mr. Gann is no “Wall Street tipster.” sending out market letters and so-called “inside
information.” Mr. Gann’s results are obtained by profound study of supply and demand, a
mathematical chart of money, business and commodities. He determines when certain cycles are
due, and the order and the time when market movements will follow.

During the past thirty years many men have proclaimed discoveries and theories to “beat the Wall
Street game .” most of which resulted in loss to their followers. They could always tell by the
chart just why the market did it after it happened. Mr.Gann’s theory differs from the others in that
he tells months in advance what stocks are going to do.

His forecast stated that some stocks would make high this year in April, some in August and
others in October- the months when he predicted the bull movement would culminate. Of a list of
a hundred stocks; thirty made highest prices in April and many declined, while others continued
higher; twenty made high during August, and fifty made high of the year in October, from which
the largest decline of the year has taken place.

27

His 1922 forecast indicated final tops on railroad stocks for August 14. The Dow Jones’s
averages on rail made high August 21 and reached the same average levels on September 11 and
October 16, but did not exceed the high made in August, which was made seven days later than
the exact date called for in the forecast.

HIS CHART A FACT

Such accurate long range forecasting as Mr.Gann is doing sounds almost unbelievable, and how
he does it I do not know, but the writer does know that he does it. My attention was first called to
his 1921 forecast in which he predicted that stocks would be bottom in August, 1921, and
advance to December, 1921. They did so. His chart or graph of the market one year in advance is
a fact, and that the course of the stock market follows it astoundingly close is equally a fact.

Mr.Gann says the trouble with most chart makers is that they work with only one factor-space
movements or charts that record one to two points up or down-whereas there are three or more
factors to be considered, space, volume and time The most vital is time, and back of that is the
cause of recurrence of high or low prices a certain intervals.

I asked Mr.Gann: “What is the cause behind the time factor?”

He smiled and said: “It has taken me twenty years of exhaustive study to learn the cause that
produces effects according to time. That is my secret and too valuable to be spread broadcast. ©
Besides, the public is not yet ready for it.”

“Water seeks its level.”continued Mr.Gann. “You can force it higher with a pump, but when you
stop pumping it requires no force to cause it to return to its former level. Stocks are the same.
They can be forced above their natural level of values to where lambs lose all fear, become
charged with hope and buy at the top. Then stocks are permitted to sink to a level where hope
gives way to despair and the most rampant bull becomes a bear and sells out with a loss. My
discovery of the time factor enables me to tell in advance when these extremes must, by the law of
supply and demand, occur in stocks and commodities.”

Low August 24th 1921.

Gann predicted the stock market low on August 24th 1921. Saturn conjunct Jupiter 1*.
Saturm/Jupiter cycles are always important in the big picture but here are the aspects that fine
tuned the turn. The Moon creates the trine aspect_to Sun conjunct Mercury 1.47*

and square Mars conjunct Neptune (exact) On the same day Jupiter is conjunct Saturn
1.46*(Balanced).The fact that there were 3 conjunctions at the same time would be an important

factor in this turning point.

Gann said there was always some sort of relationship between a top and bottom and this is why
the trine and the square are so important as starting points.

At the low in August 1921 the trine was Moon to conjunct Sun/Mercury and the ‘Square was

Another very common relationship is to look at the aspect wheel _at a high or low and find the

High July 17th 1933.

This was a Monday and he predicted a fast break into the 21st of July.On the Saturday the Sun
was conjunct Pluto 0* of orb. On the 17th the Moon formed a trine with Mars .There would not
be any other trines in this week. Between this trine were two conjunctions Sun/Pluto 1* and
Mercury/Venus 4* .

Jupiter was also in the same position due to retrograde/direct motion as it was at the low on
March Ist.(see the Strange Clocks chapter).

It is interesting to note that Mercury also went retrograde at 13* Leo on this day and that on the
16th of October 1987 Mercury went retrograde at 13* Scorpio just before the crash day.

The hexagon chart.
Price and planetary activity at the same point

The hexagram in Occult tradition is the symbol of the planets. Ganns hexagon chart is
also one of the most important for getting planetary price targets.

You will notice on Ganns may soybean chart how fast the Mars trendline is when
converted straight from longitude degree to price. The hexagon is used to slow the
trend line down. This is done by using the numbers on the hexagon chart as they relate
to price eg the numbers on the chart 90 to 91 are covered by the degrees 0 through to
L

It is always important when working on price targets to check the hexagon chart as
well as just doing straight longitude conversion.

Here are two examples on the S+P where turns triggered by planetary aspects were
related by price on the hexagon chart. eiamb me A 2a 4 yes Cre nbc

At the major S+P low of 444 Jupiter/Pluto were also conjunct at a price of 444 (28*
Scorpio)on the hexagon chart. Jupiter/Pluto were (0*of orb) on November 25th 1994.
The low of 444 was made on November 23rd (two days earlier)

The October 1997 high of 992 was made when Pluto/Mars were conjunct .The actual
high was 3 days later when price reached the same degree where Pluto/Mars were
conjunct.Prices then fell to low of 844 on the 28th October in a move that was
described later as a mini crash.

The next major top on 20th July 1998 involved Jupiter.

Jupiter was 180* from 1199 on the hexagon chart when it formed a Sun/Jupiter trine
and Mars/Jupiter square.1199 was the futures high and led to a price low of 929 on
Octofer 8th as Mars made an exact trine with Saturn.

Sa was 927 on the hexagon chart.

The hexagon and 1908.

The first thing that struck me about the date Gann made his greatest discovery for
finding the trend of stocks and commodities were the numbers themselves.

G8) 08((19) 08.

I won’t bore you with the details of how but this is what I eventually discovered is an
additional property of the hexagon.Support and resistance are calculat counti
the first n r j counting eight places.

\This does not always calculate his target prices but as you have already learnt there are
other methods to be used depending on the Astrology of the moment. This system
does calculate every price target in Ganns 1954 coffee trades so I believe that it is
valid.I have seen it working repeatedly in todays market. Here follows some of Ganns
price predictions plus some modern market examples and then the astrology of the
complete sequence of Ganns coffee trades.

In 1908 when Union Pacific was 168-1/8, he told me that it would not touch 169
before it had a good break. We sold it short all the way down to 152-5/8, covering on
the weak spots and putting it out again on the rellies, securing twenty-three points
profit out of an eighteen-point wave.

“He came to me when United States Steel was selling around 50 and said “This Steel
will run up to 58 but it will not sell at 59. From there it should break 16 3/4 points.’
We sold it short around 58 3/4 with a stop at 59. The highest it went was 58 3/4. From
there it declined to 41 1/4 -17 1/2 points.

Jupiter Ingress.

uv 1)
{ How 10 Us SQUARE OF WWE

May Soybean High at 276
Gann worked on the basis that Planetary Ingress was a potential trigger for trend —
change.

Looking at the May bean chart again your first thought would be that 270 (the ingress
longitude of Jupiter converted to price 270* =270 cents.) would be the exact price
level. Ganns Personal sq 2 ed on it this being 360 or zero

[Now his square oF nine for may beans starts at 44 cents this being the lowest recorded||

price in the contracts history.
To properly use a square of nine chart (price) that doesn’t start at one you need to

combine it with anoth uare of niné oes. Why? The price square of nine needs
the time square of nine which starts at one. When you superimpose one square on top
of the other you will get proper squaring. ?

Looking at our may bean square of nine Superimposed on the time square of nine 40 va
days from the low is exactly opposite 276Ahe high. Also 40 days was the square of the. ~
range from the low of 2(40). In February 1998 I copied this method with the slight
variation in that I also used the 1908 target method. Either way it worked.
The steps
1. convert Jupiter ingress into Longitude degrees to an approximate price area | |
where soybeans are trading.

2. use may soybe ice square of nine and then superimpose the-time-

square of nine to fine tune your target. |

This is how Gann would have worked it out Jupiter is about to change signs and so
this would be the time for a change of trend so on day 40 time is opposite price.275 is
opposite the 238 low and time and price is at aspect 180* or 90* square.

This is what I did.On Febuary 4th 1998 Jupiter changed signs and was at zero degrees

pisces until the 9th of Febuary. I have fo s usually don’t get moving until the

lanet changes to T degree of a new sign but from Febuary 4th I monitored the time
Deeg af cnet ie aioe pea a they were square and then I sold a break
of that days range.

|] The 1908 target from the 662 low was 694 1/2. Using the square of nine on day 20 the /

closest price that was square was 695.The actual high was 697.

4 (Gann never counted the fir day of a high or a low saying that they belonged as the
last day of the previous price swing.)

This method can be used on all grains when Jupiter is changing signs. Gann marked his
chart off in 15 cent target bands this being half of each signs range of 30 degrees.
Which price divisions of the 360* circle you use is dependent on the commodities
volitility.

Sf.

For something like oats 15 cents is fine but with soybeans 90* (1/4 of 360*) is usual
(price 840+90*=930 etc) when soybeans are at low price levels or trading quietly 45*

is good eg.500 545 590 etc.

The markings on the following charts are the price/longitude where Jupiter changed
signs and they were projected out for the whole year. Where 2 lines are closer together_
it is because Jupiter is just about to change sign.

Using the hexagon 1908 price target method with soybeans.
May beans 1989 and 1998, March soybeans 1999.

The hexagon has support and resistance levels at numbers running-on the same line

both sideways and up and down as well as the 1908 count. These are used on intraday
swings as well.

A price can be treated in several ways depending on the volitility. 7500 cents on
soybeans will reduce to 750 or 75.When trading intraday you would use 750 but to get
longer term targets you would use 75.

1908 price target method and soybeans -May be 1989-

High 100.50=100.5
1908 targets 93.5 too close =930
80.5 opposite =805
74 1/2 =745 actual price hit 747

Low 747 = -=74.5
1908 targets 81.5
90.5 opposite actual price hit 91.4

In a wide ranging market the numbers have to be scaled down otherwise there will be
too many targets. 10050 reduces to 100.5.

The first target counting clockwise 100.5 to 93.5 is too close to the current market
action to possibly be called a swing.

805 would have been the low on a intraday basis and held the range for 3 days (not
marked) no entry was triggered of the daily charts.

It then went lower and missed the bottom target. The target was 745 the actual price
hit was 747. Four days later an entry long was triggered.

trading. Means you trail the stop 1cent beond the high/low of the most recent 2
days once you get into a target area. Intraday use 5 minute charts and tight stops if you
are buying and if a double bottom has formed on the 30 minute charts stop and reverse
if this is broken.

The target does not have to be exact as a little short fall or penetration is normal. You
The next thing to do believing that the swing low is in place is to draw up another
hexagon chart with 1908 targets using 747 as the low. I would use either 74.5 or 75 it
is not that important.

The first target of 81.15 was gapped through so that was never a problem.

With 1908 targets resistance becomes support and vice versa so when the market came
back to the 815 level and held this was support and another buy was made on the
topside break of the two days range. This took us up to the next 1908 level where we
took profits and reversed.

We now have swing high | and 2.

Gann always projected targets from the first and second high (low) he mentions this in
“How to make profits in stocks and commodities”

High 2 914=91.5 is a price projection from the low so the targets that we had on the
way up will be the same as the ones on the way down. Now we come to the reason I
always recommend taking quick profits on half a position. Choppy markets the death
of tight entry trading. In October there was a bounce off 1908 support and what
looked like a double low. (at+b.)

Soys went slowly higher and ran out of steam then quickly broke the double 1908
support where you stopped out and reversed. (failure of a double support)

Here follows a period of chop but in which you consistantly made small profits. On
half your position and still made the bigger gain as the market went to the 1908 target
(B) from high number 1.

Point C is interesting a 1908 target that held in July and November was broken. You
would always sell this break but note the following price action because it is a reliable
signal to buy again. Soys spent 5 days under this major break out and then went
nowhere.

The day soys closed higher and above the 1908 line you would go long again.

This is what Gann called regaining the angle when using his 45* lines etc.

From the new low 734 work out the 1908 targets again.

This is where you have to make a judgment call. Looking back at the begining of the
chart June,July, August,September there was much more volitility than now and this
has been decreasing steadily. The rally from C has been steady but slow with small
daily ranges and this is why I have used 734 to get the 1908 targets and not 73.4 as I
would have earlier.

Summary.

- 1908 targets are scaled depending on volitility.

- A break of the 2 days range is used for entry.

- Quick profits are taken on 1/2 the position.

- With A failure of a 1908 support resistance after holding the market 2 times the
position is automaticly reversed.

Examples of the 1908 price target method from recent markets.

- Things to remember with the 1908 price point method.
- Support becomes resistance.

- Big moves come out of big time bases so targets against the trend are usually profit

take points that give you an opportunity to re enter at a better price.

Strange clocks.

Time is measured by the 360* circle the earth moves around the Sun. There is nothing
bizarre about the idea of looking at cycles of say 10 days 4 weeks or the 4 year
election cycle etc. If we stretch our imagination a little there is nothing that prevents us
from using the other planets as clocks. You will find that there are tradeable cycles
made by taking the mechanical path of the planets in relation to the earth and using
them to measure time.

There are two ways of tracking the planets. One is heliocentric (earth around the Sun)
and geocentric (the planets as viewed from earth) all the examples that are in this book
are based on the geocentric ephemerides.An emphemerides is a book containing the
position of all planets on any day and what degree longitude they are at in a 360*
circle.

The geocentric view gives some very useful techniques, the first being planets that
appear to go backwards (retrograde) and then forward (direct) this means that they
cover the same degrees several times. W.D.Gann was a great believer in this as a
timing tool and my own researches support this. He believed that planetary
conjunctions (planets that are at the same degree longitude of a 360* circle) and
planetary oppositions could cause turns in the market and when one of the planets
went retrograde it would catch up with the other planet again forming another
conjunction. This process could cause double and triple bottoms and tops.The spot
Dmk chart showing the U.S. dollar low in 1995 is a perfect example of this.

I’ve developed a couple of simple techniques to use retrograde/direct planets and a few
examples will make them clear.

Jupiter head and shoulders.

I was looking for the next time cycle of Jupiter on the Dow.I thought is was possible that a head
and shoulders would form] had the Jupiter position for the left shoulder and the head so I wanted
to know when the right shoulder would complete.

The Dow had formed a left shoulder in the later period of Jupiter going retrograde at 21*
Aquarius. The head was made on August 7th 1997 this was 7 days after Jupiter changed degree
to18* Aquarius.

21*-18*=3*+7days.

Jupiter would be retrograde until November so the next proportionate point would be made when
Jupiter was at 15* Aquarius

21-18=3* difference

18-15=3* difference

The high was made 7days from Jupiter being at 18* so the target date was Jupiter at 15* plus 7
days.

25August+7days is September Ist .This date was a low so it completed the right shoulder
scenario.I was still looking for a 2nd top. I then took 3* from 15*=12*+7days.

Jupiter was at 12* on the 30th of September.Then adding 7 days (counting September 30th as 1)
The target date was October 6th. The actual high was October 7th.

To summarise.

Shoulder Jupiter 21*.

Head Jupiter 18* +7 days August 7th.

Shoulder Jupiter 15*+7 days September Ist.

S+P top secondary high dow Jupiter 12* +7days.
Target October 6th.

Actual top October 7th.

Retrograde/Direct cycles.

A once only cycle is produced by a planet going from direct to retrograde and then back to direct.
This planetary motion can effect any market so the best way to utilise this method is to simply
look for any market where a peak or trough was made as the planets turned retrograde . A cycle
will be due when the planets go direct. This may be a high or low or a breakout of a range.

Spot Dmk/U.:S. at the major low in 1995.Each time Jupiter returned to the same degree that it
was at when the dollar made its first low there would be a cycle low. The third (and last) time this
happened the dollar made a final low and started moving much higher.

August 26th 1998.

Sun trine Saturn 0* a ~
Saturn square Mars (

Using the hexagon chart again we look for any price target§ in the area the S+P is
trading and the target is 1112.50. Saturn is the pivotal platiet in the trine and the
square. Also because it is the Sun making a trine we can convert the Sun into longitude
degree 153* and add numbers in 45* steps to get a price target.

If the market is rising we are looking to sell if it is falling we are looking to buy.

The longitude degree is 1098 so we have 2 targets 1112.50 and 1098.

Here are the price levels for September futures.

August 24th 1098.75 1080.50

August 25th 1111.00 1088.25

August 26th 1096.50 1077.50

As you see the price targets were hit on the 25th one day before the exact trine and the
market slid 176 PTS over six days. If was a safe sell but a trendline break or a
breakout of the 2 days range is good when you want confirmation.

( Jupiter clock ‘and the September 23rd high.

| When Jupiter is retrograde or has just turned direct again I always look for time cycles.

_; At the July 20th high Jupiter was at 28* pisces. At the low of September 1st Jupiter

was at 25* Pisces. It had changed to 25* on the 31st of August so counting the 31st
and the 1st was Z days. Jupiter 28*-3*=25*-3*=22*

The next cycle would be 25*-3*+2 days Jupiter would change to 22* Pisces on the
23rd of September plus 2 days marking the f September i
area.

The price target using the 1908 formula was 1182 from the September Ist low of 936.
The price was missed by 2 points and declined into the 25th which may have been a
cycle low day. In these cases you have to use your judgement whether to hold or fold
but you have to enter on a breakout of the range one way or another.

The next pages show the intraday price action at the top it was very quiet and this is
the sort of safe trade you can make by trading at the price target with a small stop.
The chart of Jupiter clock shows the excellent call on the September 23rd top Notice
though at (4) the next clock cycle held the market for 8 days and then got blown out.
That is why everyone must trade with stops that are as small as possible. It is
interesting to note that there were no 1908 price targets at (4).

points and some good short term swings around the time of an eclipse but I can find no evidence
that they were a factor in any of these Gann trades except by chance or if they were they are not
necessary to solving them.

As I understand it he felt that eclipses were important and I wonder if he used them to make his
annual forecasts.In traditional astrology an eclipse at any point was assigned a meaning such as
forecasting a war,drought, panic etc. This would be easy enough to check if we had all of his
annual forecasts.

Robert Gordons great campaign in cotton.

These are some of the Cotton trades from “Tunnel Thru The Air.”

First we will look at the high as it relates to the low.

Price targets first. A major low of 1250 (125) on the 4th of December 1926. Using the hexagon
chart the high on the 8th of September 1927 was 2440 (244) and exactly opposite the low.

The Astrology at the low on 4th of December 1926 was conjunct Mercury/Saturn 4* of orb, trine
Uranus and Saturn/Mercury square Neptune.

The Mercury trine Uranus aspect was the closest at the bottom so the next planet moving
clockwise is Mars so this should feature in the high which it does.At the high

Mars is opposite the Uranus/Jupiter conjunction which is trine Saturn.

Now we’ll kick off with the Robert Gordon trades from June 25th through to the predicted high
on September 6th.

‘eZ

“wr

We have requested Mr.Gann to figure out for the readers of The Ticker a few of the
most striking indications which appear in his calculations. In presenting these we wish
it understood that no man, in or out of Wall Street, is infallible.

Mr.Gann’s figures at present indicate that the trend of the stock market should, barring
the usual rallies, be toward lower prices until March or April, 1910.

He calculates that May wheat, which is now selling at $1.02, should not sell below 99
cents, and should sell at $1.45 next spring.

On cotton, which is now at about the 15 cents level, he estimates that, after a good
reaction from these prices, the commodity should reach 18 cents in the spring of 1910.
He looks for a corner in the March or May option.

Whether these figures prove correct or not, will in no sense detract from the record
which Mr. Gann has already established.

Mr.Gann was born in Lufkin, Texas, and is thirty-one years of age. He is a gifted
mathematician, has an extraordinary memory for figures, and is an expert Tape Reader.
Take away his science and he would beat the market on his intuitive tape reading
alone.

Endowed as he is with such qualities, we have no hesitation in predicting that within a
comparatively few years William D.Gann will receive full recognition as one of Wall
Street’s leading operators.

Note:-Since the above forecast was made, Cotton has suffered the expected decline,

the extreme break having been 120 points. The lowest on May wheat thus far has been
$ 1.01-5/8. It is now selling at $ 1.06 1/4.

164

“After years of patient study I have proven to my entire satisfaction as well as
demonstrated to others that vibration explains every possible phase and condition of
the market.”

In order to substantiate Mr.Gann’s claims as to what he has been able to do under this
method, we called upon Mr. William E. Gilley, an Inspector of imports, 16 Beaver
Street, New York. Mr.Gilley is well-known in the downtown district. He himself has
studied stock market movements for twenty-five years, during which time he has
examined every piece of market literature that has been issued and procurable in Wall
Street. It was he who encouraged Mr.Gann to study out the scientific and
mathematical possibilities of the subject. When asked what had been the most
impressive of Mr. Gann’s work and predictions , he replied as follows:

“Tt is very difficult for me to remember all the predictions and operations of Mr.Gann
which may be classed as phenomenal, but the following are a few: In 1908 when Union
Pacific was 168-1/8, he told me that it would not touch 169 before it had a good
break. We sold it short all the way down to 152-5/8, covering on the weak spots and
putting it out again on the rallys, securing twenty-three points profit out of an
eighteen-point wave.

“He came to me when United States Steel was selling around 50 and said “This Steel
will run up to 58 but it will not sell at 59. From there it should break 16 3/4 points.’
We sold it short around 58 3/4 with a stop at 59. The highest it went was 58 3/4. From
there it declined to 41 1/4 -17 1/2 points.

“At another time wheat was selling at about 89 cents. He predicted that the May
option would sell at $1.35.We bought it and made large profits on the way up. It
actually touched $1.35 1/2.

“When Union Pacific was 172, he said it would go to 184-7/8 but not an eighth higher
until it had had a good break. It went to 184-7/8 and came back from there eight or
nine times. We sold it short repeatedly with a stop at 185 and were never caught. It
eventually came back to 172 1/2.

“Mr.Gann’s calculations are based on natural law. I have followed his work closely for
years. I know that he has a firm grasp of the basic principles which govern stock
market movements, and I do not believe any other man on earth can duplicate the idea
or his method at the present time.

“Early this year he figured that the top of the advance would fall on a certain day in
August and calculated the prices at which the Dow-Jones averages would then stand.
The market culminated on the exact day and within four-tenths of one percent of the
figures predicted.”

“You and Mr.Gann must have cleaned up considerable money on all these operations,”
was suggested.

movements. I then decided to devote ten years of my life to the study of natural law as
applicable to the speculative markets and to devote my best energies toward making
speculation a profession. After exhaustive researches and investigations of the known
sciences, I discovered that the Law of Vibration enabled me to accurately determine
the exact points to which stocks or commodities should rise and fall within a given
time. The working out of this law determines the cause and predicts the effect long
before the Street is aware of either. Most speculators can testify to the fact that it is
looking at the effect and ignoring the cause that has produced their losses.

“It is impossible here to give an adequate idea of the Law of Vibration as I apply it to
the market, however, the layman may be able to grasp some of the principles when |
state that the Law of Vibration is the fundamental law upon which wireless telegraphy,
wireless telephone and phonographs are based. Without the existence of this law the
above inventions would have been impossible.

“In order to test out the efficiency of my idea I have not only put in years of labor in
the regular way, but I spent nine months working night and day in the Astor Library of
New York and in the British Museum of London, going over the records of stock
transactions as far back as 1820. I have incidentally examined the manipulations of Jay
Gould Drew Commodore Vanderbilt, and all the other important Wall Street
manipulators from that time to the present day. I have examined every quotation of
Union Pacific prior to and from the time of E.H. Harriman’s securing control, and can
say that of all the manipulations in the history of Wall Street, Mr.Harriman’s was the
most masterly. The figures show that, whether unconsciously or not, Mr. Harriman
worked strictly in accordance with natural law.

“In gomg over the history of markets and the great mass of related statistics, it soon

becomes apparent that certain laws govern the changes and variations in the value of (//4 Tac)
stocks and there exists a periodic or cyclic law, which is at the back of all these—< Echypse ey he

movements. Observation has shown that there are regular periods of intense activity on
the Exchange followed by periods of inactivity. Mr.Henry Hall, in his recent book
devoted much space to “Cycles of Prosperity and Depression” which he found
recurring at regular intervals of time. The law which I have applied will not only give
these long cycles or swings, but the daily and even hourly movements of stocks. By
knowing the exact vibration of each individual stock I am able to determine at what

- point each will receive support and at what point the greatest resistance is to be met.

Those in close touch with the market have market have noticed the phenomena of ebb
and flow, or rise and fall in the value of stocks. At certain times a stock will become
intensely active, large transactions being made in it, at other times this same stock will
become practically stationary or inactive with a very small volume of sales.I have
found that the Law of Vibration governs and controls these conditions. I have also
found that certain phases of this law governs the rise in a stock and an entirely different
rule operates on the decline.

“While Union Pacific and other railroad stocks which made their high prices in August
were declining, United States Steel common was steadily advancing. The Law of
Vibration was at work, sending a particular stock on the upward trend, whilst others
were trending downward.

July 25th 1927.
Sold 500 October cotton at 19.00
Sold 500 December at 19.20
Went short 500 December at 19.20.
Decline followed as he expected.

As usual the first step is to look for the trines

Sun trine Saturn 0*

Sun trine Jupiter Uranus 1*

So here we have another grand trine with the Sun acting as the trigger this time
Saturn is square Mars 0*

The high price of 19.20 (192) is exactly opposite the June 25th low of 16.80 (168)
The reality of the 1908 targets is that they shift from 8 places to opposite and back
otherwise prices would be forever just oscillating back and forth.

August 9th 1927.

Sold out his 1500 December at 20.30
and sold 1000 December short at 20.30.
A big decline followed.

The Moon is often the crucial part of Ganns trades because it acts as the timer by
creating the important aspects to the slow moving planets.

Here the Moon is trine Neptune (3*) and square the Jupiter Uranus conjunction(2*).
A one degree separation of aspects on a fast moving body like the Moon is
insignificant so I would say this is also a good balance.

Already this gives us a good trine plus conjunction and square but the Moon sets up
anothet ‘good pattern.

Moon trine Neptune 3*

Neptune square Saturn 4*

: Diagram 13-8 The hexagon chart.

August 13th 1927.

August 13,1927
Bought 1000 December cotton at 19.10
and bought 1000 December at 19.10 for long
He started in to pyramid on the way up.

The grand trine is back and activated by Mercury.Mercury is trine 0* Jupiter/Uranus
conjunct.

Uranus/Jupiter are trine Saturn 4* and Saturn is square the Moon 5*

At the low in 1926 part of the set up was Mercury trine Uranus 0* and here it is again
ina strong setting.

The Moon is opposite Neptune 0*

The Moon is also trine the node 0*

and Venus is square the node 0*

This is the situation re price targets Gann said he bought at 19.10. If you use the
hexagon chart the conjunction of Jupiter and Uranus gives a target of 19.30.

There are no other hexagon targets but the timing is exellent today and this always
takes precedence over price.

September 6th 1927.

This is the date Gann forecast for a top.As shown earlier the price target form the 1926 low of
125 was exactly opposite on the hexagon chart at 244 and this was the high.

The trines.Saturn trine Uranus 0* and Saturn trine Jupiter 1* which is conjunct Uranus 1* Mars is
in opposition to Jupiter.

The Moon is very interesting here it is trine the Sun 4* trine Mercury 7* opposite Pluto 7*
Square Uranus 7* (balanced aspects) thus creating another Gann set-up to the Uranus Jupiter
conjunction.

September 23rd 1927.

The Jupiter /Uranus combination has given us the high. The next major planet is Pluto.

A major reversal such as the early September high is not followed by another for months in any
market.

All the swing turns from here that Gann predicts are based on the next aspects to Pluto (they
don’t involve a trine) in this case they are squares. This is defiantly an idea worth looking at
further in real time because we can always see the next planet that will have a major influence on
the next turn so it is easy enough to plot the days when this planet will have square aspects before
the next trine.These days should be swing days.

On September 23rd Mercury is exactly square Pluto.

The next low is the 6th of October when Mars is exactly square Pluto.

Predicting which planet will be involved in the next high or low.

From the few complete sequences of trades that we have it would appear that the planet that will
feature in the next set up is the next in line at the time of the set up. Like a clock going from one
marker to the next. This sequence ends when there is a grand cross. The reason | think this is that
in “Tunnel thru the air” he calls October 3rd 1931 as the great market low which it was for 5
weeks. This was a very good grand cross.

Over his career he had a lot of more accurate calls than this yet he makes note of it again in the
form of a telegram from the man who featured in the ticker interview (Mr. W.E.Gilley).

When you consider it a grand cross is a good place to finish the clock like sequence.

As an example of the clock like idea refer back to the July 20th 1998 high on the S+P (Sun trine
Jupiter) and see the next planet is Saturn.At the October 8th low it was Saturn trine Mars.
