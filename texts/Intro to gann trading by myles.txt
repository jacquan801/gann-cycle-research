Introduction to Astrological and Technical
Trading of Stocks and Commodities

I am going to assume for the purposes of this book that everyone is a beginner to
both the markets and astrology. Also that they have a small sized starting account
currently but would like to get most of their income from this account in the future.

In this book I hope to prove to you that astrological cycles are a valid form of
market analysis that can give you the edge you need to be constantly profitable.
As well as the astrological cycles I will show you some simple price charting
techniques that I have found to be very useful.

These cycles are the most basic and serve as an introduction. You can add more
complex analytical routines, as you become more skillful.

When studying this book don’t try and learn everything on the first reading, scan
through and see what is appealing to you. This is a book of ideas, you must check for
yourself to see if the cycle you’re interested in continues to be valid.

At the end of the book is a glossary of astrological terms for your reference.

If you are going to discover the truth you will have to throw away preconceived
notions about measuring time and start from the beginning. If you know something
about traditional astrology already my advice would be to start again in Financial
Astrology as it is different from what you are use to working with.

You will find that there are many, very reliable cycles based on the fixed positions of
the planets and also when they are at certain distances from other planets (aspects)

I suggest that you get to know one or two particular cycles for any Stock or
Commodity in detail, prove to yourself its validity and then trade it as a separate
system. Entry rules should be simple such as a break from a trading range or of a
trend line.

Ninety Percent of my trading is now based on these Astrological cycles and that is
because the longer I have spent working with them the more confidence I have in
their effectiveness.

The solar system can be viewed in two ways. The original form was as seen from
earth (geocentric) and then once it was discovered that the earth went around the
Sun (heliocentric) both methods are used, and surprisingly, geocentric is equally
effective.

When viewed from earth at certain times of the year planets appear to go
backwards, this results in the apparent slowing down and speeding up of the planets
compared to the more regular path of the Sun centered heliocentric view.
The following chart is of heliocentric Mercury. Note that the speed angle is steep.

This chart is of exactly the same time period but is the Mercury geocentric (from

earth) view.
Notice how this is much slower, the dips in the line are when Mercury is appearing
to go backwards across the sky (retrograde) and then the line turns up as Mercury
then goes forward (direct)

Fixed Cycles
A fixed cycle is the easiest cycle to work with. Every Stock or Commodity is sensitive
to at least one planet crossing a particular degree of the Zodiac.

I will show you how to find these fixed cycles soon but first I would like to
demonstrate a few examples for you on different markets so you can see how they
may work.

The chart below is a weekly U.S. Bond chart it is marked with the degree where
heliocentric Venus was at the time of the weekly close. These particular weeks were
chosen because during those weeks Venus was hitting one of the sensitive degrees in
the natal chart (birth) for U.S. Bond futures.

The exact cycle is heliocentric Venus at 56, 176 and 296 degrees.

How to find a fixed cycle for any market

It is much easier to process many markets quickly by using a fixed cycle.

The fixed cycle can be generated by using the natal chart. This chart may be from
the first trade date of the contract, from a significant high or low or even from the
time of an important event that was relevant to that market such as when a
currency was taken off a peg and was allowed to free float.

To get a fixed cycle look for three things.

1 Venus degree

2 Mars degree

3 Planets that are conjunct, trine or square (within 3 degrees of orb or less)

First of all look at the position of Venus.

Note Venus’ degree and find the trine points by adding 120 degrees.
i.e. Venus is at 1 degree plus 120 = 121 this is a fixed cycle point.

Then 121 + 120 = 241 this is another fixed cycle point
By adding another 120 results in 361 degrees which is back to the start at 1 degree.
Next get the 90 degree points from Venus’ start position, in this case they would be

91, 181 and 271 degrees.

In summary find the points 90, 120, 180, 240 and 270 degrees from the natal planets
position which is found at the date of birth or significant high or low.

What should happen is that the next time Venus is in one of these positions the
market should change trend. Some times the change is major but more often minor
swings will develop at these points.

Next repeat the same process but using Mars instead of Venus.

The planets that are conjunct, trine or square (within 3 degrees of orb or less) may
also create a fixed cycle when they are in aspect to each other again.

Look for in steps of 30 degrees between big planets such as Jupiter and Saturn or 90
and 120 degree separations between faster planets.

All these cycles should be checked against the commodity or stock that you are
trading you may find that both Venus and Mars cycles will work well on one market

for example but only Venus on an another or in some markets not at all.

When new major highs or lows are made in any market start fixed cycles from these
points.

Fixed Cycles Found to be Useful

The following lists a few of the fixed cycles that I have found to be
useful.

Swiss franc Mars 92, 182, 212, 272, 332, 2 degrees geocentric

Swiss franc Mercury conjunct Mars geocentric

Swiss franc Mars 30 degree steps from Jupiter geocentric

British pound Mars 30 degree steps from Uranus geocentric

Soybeans Mars geo 1936 natal 276 degrees (no other points)

Soybeans Mars geo 60, 124, 188, 252, 316 degrees (special cycle)

Soybeans Venus trine Saturn geocentric

Corn Mars geo (high July 12 1996) 80.86 degrees 171, 201, 261, 321, 351 degrees
S+P Mercury conjunct Sun geo

S+P Mercury 230, 110, 350 degrees geo

S+P Sun trine Saturn geo

S+P Sun trine and square Jupiter geo

U.S. Bonds Venus Heliocentric 56, 176, 296 degrees

IBM (natal) Mars 30 degree steps from Jupiter geo

IBM Mars 30 degree steps to Uranus but only up to 60 degrees of Mars conjunct
Uranus geo

Fixed cycles are also repeating aspects that have a correlation with trend changes

either major or minor in specific markets. The charts that follow are of this type of
fixed cycle.

Another type of Fixed cycle is when a planet changes from one sign into another.

This is called Ingress
The Ingress points are where the traditional zodiac signs begin.

The chart below shows Venus ingress plotted against the Australian Dollar.

The sloping line is Venus and the horizontal is the 30 degree zodiac points, when the
two intersect it is at the ingress point. I have marked the last three ingress’ on the

Planetary ingress of Venus and Mars are more often minor swings because they
happen so frequently. A cycle that can produce larger swings is heliocentric Venus
conjunct or 120 degrees from Uranus.

Larger swings have slightly more time leeway such as up to four days either side of
the exact aspect. They are warnings to be prepared to take action. Entry methods
can be faster moving averages or trend line breaks that confirm by price a change of
trend.

Planets by degrees is the concept of a planet moving x degrees either geocentric or
heliocentric. When the bigger planets are used timing is approximate so other technical
signals are needed for entry.

Retrograde - Direct Planets as a Cycle Timer

This is a simple technique that anyone can use. The planets when viewed from earth
will at certain times appear to go backwards. This means that they will cover the
same degree of the circle going forward (direct) and backwards (retrograde) and
then direct again.

To use this in trading have a look at the degree of a planets position when a major
swing high or low is made and then expect a reversal of trend when the planet again
crosses this degree.

An example using Saturn retrograde / direct on the S+P.

Saturn was at 45.25 degrees while retrograde on October 18th 1999

which was a low. The next time that Saturn crossed this exact degree while direct
was on the 28-29th of March 2000 with the actual high being on Friday the 24th of
March giving us three trading days from the top.

Another example of retrograde / direct cycles for longer term forecasts.
is seen in the chart of the British pound.

At point 1 Uranus is at 315.91 degrees while retrograde. At point 2
Uranus is again at 315.91 degrees while direct.

Jupiter was direct when the Deutsche Mark made its high. The cursor marks the
day of the cash high. By the time the futures had opened price had pulled back
but we will use this day as it was the real high of the 24 hour market.

Jupiter was direct at 254.49 degrees.

The next time Jupiter passed the same degree while retrograde
and then direct are marked on the chart. As you can see each pass of Jupiter over
the same degree created a good trade.

William D. Gann
An Operator Whose Science and Ability Place Him in the Front Rank-

His Remarkable Predictions and Trading Record.

Sometime ago the attention of this magazine was attracted by certain long pull stock
market predictions which were being made by William D. Gann. In a large number
of cases Mr. Gann gave us in advance the exact points at which certain stocks and
commodities would sell, together with prices close to the then prevailing figures
which would not be touched.

For instance, when New York Central was 131 he predicted that it would sell at 145
before 129.

So repeatedly did his figures prove to be accurate, and so different did his work
appear from that of any expert whose methods we had examined, that we set about
to investigate Mr. Gann and his way of figuring out these predictions, as well as the
particular use which he was making of them in the market.

The results of this investigation are remarkable in many ways.

It appears to be a fact that Mr. Gann has developed an entirely new idea as to the
principles governing stock market movements. He bases his operations upon certain
natural laws which though existing since the world began, have only in recent years
been subjected to the will of man, and added to the list of so-called discoveries.

We have asked Mr. Gann for an outline of his work, and have secured some
remarkable evidence as to the results obtained therefrom. We submit this in full
recognition of the fact that in Wall Street, a man with a new idea, an idea which
violates the traditions and encourages a scientific view of the proposition is not
usually welcomed by the majority, for the reason that he stimulates thought and
research. These activities said majority abhors.

Mr. Gann's description of his experience and methods is given herewith. It should

be read with a recognition of the established fact that Mr. Gann's predictions have
proved correct in a large majority of instances.

60
"For the past ten years I have devoted my entire time and attention to the
speculative markets.

Like many others, I lost thousands of dollars and experienced the usual ups and
downs incidental to the novice who enters the market without preparatory
knowledge of the subject.

"T soon began to realize that all successful men, whether lawyers, doctors, or
scientists, devoted years of time to the study and investigation of their particular
pursuit or profession before attempting to make any money out of it.

"Being in the brokerage business myself and handling large accounts, I had
opportunities seldom afforded the ordinary man for studying the cause of success
and failure in the speculations of others. I found that over ninety per cent of the
traders who go into the market without knowledge or study usually lose in the end.

"T soon began to note the periodical recurrence of the rise and fall in stocks and
commodities. This led me to conclude that natural law was the basis of market
movements. I then decided to devote ten years of my life to the study of natural law
as applicable to the speculative markets and to devote my best energies toward
making speculation a profitable profession. After exhaustive researches and
investigations of the known sciences, I discovered that the Law of Vibration enabled
me to accurately determine the exact points to which stocks or commodities

should rise and fall within a given time. The working out of this law determines the
cause and predicts the effect long before the Street is aware of either. Most
speculators can testify to the fact that it is looking at the effect and ignoring the
cause that has produced their losses.

"It is impossible here to give an adequate idea of the Law of Vibration as I apply it
to the markets, however, the layman may be able to grasp some of the principles
when I state that the Law of Vibration is the fundamental law upon which wireless
telegraphy, wireless telephone and phonographs are based. Without the existence of
this law the above inventions would have been impossible.

"In order to test out the efficiency-of my idea I have not only put in years of labor in
the regular way, but I spent nine months working night and day in the Astor
Library of New York and in the British Museum of London, going over the records
of stock transactions as far back as 1820. 1 have incidentally examined the
manipulations of Jay Gould, Daniel Drew, Commodore Vanderbilt, and all the
other important Wall Street manipulators from that time to the present day. I have
examined every quotation of Union Pacific prior to and from the time of E.H.
Harriman's securing control, and can say that of all the manipulations in the
history of Wall Street, Mr. Harriman's was the most masterly. The figures show
that, whether unconsciously or not, Mr. Harriman worked strictly in accordance
with natural law.

61
"Tn going over the history of markets and the great mass of related statistics, it soon
becomes apparent that certain laws govern the changes and variations in the value
of stocks and there exists a periodic or cyclic law, which is at the back of all these
movements. Observation has shown that there are regular periods of intense activity
on the Exchange followed by periods of inactivity. Mr. Henry Hall, in his recent
book devoted much space to 'Cycles of Prosperity and Depression’ which he found
recurring at regular intervals of time. The law which I have applied will not only
give these long cycles or swings, but the daily and even hourly movements of stocks.
By knowing the exact vibration of each individual stock I am able to determine at
what point each will receive support and at what point the greatest resistance is

to be met.

Those in close touch with the market have noticed the phenomena of ebb and flow,
or rise and fall in the value of stocks. At certain times a stock will become
practically stationary or inactive with a very small volume of sales. I have found
that the Law of Vibration governs and controls these conditions. I have also found
that certain phases of this law governs the rise in a stock and an entirely different
rule operates on the decline.

"While Union Pacific. and other railroad stocks which made their high prices in
August were declining, United States Steel common was steadily advancing. The
Law of Vibration was at work, sending a particular stock on the upward trend,
whilst others were trending downward.

"T have found that in the stock itself exists its harmonic or inharmonic relationship
to the driving power or force behind it. The secret of all its activity is therefore
apparent. By my method IJ can determine the vibration of each stock and by also
taking certain time values into consideration I can in the majority of cases tell
exactly what the stock will do under given conditions.

"The power to determine the trend of the market is due to my knowledge of the
characteristics of each individual stock and a certain grouping of different stocks
under their proper rates of vibration. Stocks are like electrons, atoms, and
molecules, which hold persistently to their own individuality in response to the
fundamental Law of Vibration. Science teaches 'that an original impulse of any kind
finally resolves itself into periodic or rhythmical motion,’ also 'just as the pendulum
returns again in its swing, just as the moon returns in its orbit, just as the advancing
year ever brings the roses of spring, so do the properties of the elements periodically
recur as the weight of the atoms rises.'

"From my extensive investigations, studies and applied tests, I find that not only do
the various stocks vibrate, but that the driving forces controlling the stocks are also
in a state of vibration. These vibratory forces can only be known by the movements
they generate on the stocks and their values in the market. Since all great swings or
movements of the market are cyclic they act in accordance with periodic law.

62
"Science had laid down the principle that 'the properties of an element are a
periodic function of its atomic weight.' A famous scientist has stated that 'we are
brought to the conviction that diversity in phenomenal nature in its different
kingdoms, is most intimately associated with numerical relationship. The numbers
are not intermixed, chaotically and accidentally, but are subject to regular
periodicity. The changes and developments are also seen to be in many

cases undulatory.'

"Thus, I affirm, every class of phenomena, whether in nature or in the stock
market, must be subject to the Universal Law of Causation and Harmony. Every
effect must have an adequate cause.

"If we wish to avert failure in speculation we must deal with causes. Everything in
existence is based on exact proportion and perfect relationship. There is no chance
in nature, because mathematical principles of the highest order lie at the foundation
of all things. Faraday said:

'There is nothing in the Universe but mathematical points of force.'

"Vibration is fundamental; nothing is exempt from this law; it is universal,
therefore applicable to every class of phenomena on the globe.

"Through the Law of Vibration every stock in the market moves in its own
distinctive sphere of activities, as to intensity, volume and direction; all the essential
qualities of its evolution are characterized in its own rate of vibration. Stocks,

like atoms, are really centers of energies, therefore they are controlled,
mathematically. Stocks create their own field of action and power; power to attract
and repel, which principle explains why certain

stocks at times lead the market and ‘turn dead' at other times. Thus to speculate
scientifically it is absolutely necessary to follow natural law.

"After years of patient study I have proven to my entire satisfaction as well as
demonstrated to others that vibration explains every possible phase and condition of
the market."

In order to substantiate Mr. Gann's claims as to what he has been able to do under
this method, we called upon Mr. William E. Gilley, an Inspector of Imports, 16
Beaver Street, New York. Mr. Gilley is well-known in the downtown district. He
himself has studied stock market movements for twenty-five years, during which
time he has examined every piece of market literature that has been issued and
procurable in Wall Street. It was he who encouraged Mr. Gann to study out the
scientific and mathematical possibilities of the subject. When asked what had been
the most impressive of Mr. Gann's work and predictions, he replied as follows:

"It is very difficult for me to remember all the predictions and operations of Mr.
Gann which may be classed as phenomenal, but the following are a few: In 1908

63
when Union Pacific was 168-1/8, he told me that it would not touch 169 before it had
a good break. We sold it short all the way down to 152-5/8, covering on the weak
spots and putting it out again on the rallies, securing twenty-three points profit out
of an eighteen-point wave.

"He came to me when United States Steel was selling around 50 and said "This Steel
will run up to 58 but it will not sell at 59. From there it should break 16-3/4 points.
"We sold it short around 58-3/4 with a stop at 59. The highest it went was 58 3/4.
From there it declined to 41 1/4 - 17 1/2 points.

" At another time wheat was selling at about 89 cents. He predicted that the May
option would sell at $1.35. We bought it and made large profits on the way up. It
actually touched $1.35-1/2.

"When Union Pacific as 172, he said it would go to 187 7/8 but not an eighth higher
until it had kad a good break. It went to 184-7/8 and came back from there eight or
nine times. We sold it short repeatedly with a stop at 185 and were never caught. It
eventually came back to 172-1/2.

"Mr. Gann's calculations are based on natural law. I have followed his work closely
for years. I know that he had a firm grasp of the basic principles which govern stock
market movements and I do not believe any other man on earth can duplicate the
idea or his method at the present time.

"Early this year he figures that the top of the advance would fall on a certain day in
August and calculated the prices at which the Dow-Jones averages would then
stand. The market culminated on the exact day and within four-tenths of one
percent of the figures predicted."

"You and Mr. Gann must have cleaned up considerable money on all these
operations," we suggested.

"Yes, we have made a great deal of money. He has taken half a million dollars out of
the market in the past few years. I once saw him take $130, and in less than one
month run it up to over $12,000. He can compound money faster than any man I
ever met."

"One of the most astonishing calculations made by Mr. Gann was during last
summer (1909) when he predicted that September wheat would sell at $1.20. This
meant that it must touch that figure before the end of the month of September. At
twelve o'clock, Chicago time, on September 30th (the last day) the option was selling
below $1.08, and it looked as though his prediction would not be fulfilled. Mr. Gann
said, 'If it does not touch $1.20 by the close of the market it will prove that there is
something wrong with my whole method of calculation. I do not care what the price
is now, it must go there." It is common history that September wheat surprised the

64
whole country by selling at $1.20 and no higher in the very last hour of the trading,
closing at that figure."

So much for what Mr. Gann has said and done as evidenced by himself and others.
Now as to what demonstrations have taken place before our representative:

During the month of October, 1909, in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann made, in
the presence of our representative, two hundred and eighty-six transactions in
various stocks, on both the long and short side of the market. Two hundred and
sixty-four of these transactions resulted in profits, twenty-two in losses.

The capital with which he operated was doubled ten times, so that at the end of the
month he had one thousand per cent on his original margin.

In our presence Mr. Gann sold Steel common short at 94-7/8, saying that it would
not go to 95.
It did not.

On a drive which occurred during the week ending October 29, Mr. Gann bought
Steel common at 86-1/4, saying that it would not go to 86. The lowest it sold was 86-
1/8.

We have seen him give in one day sixteen successive orders in the same stock, eight
of which turned out to beat either the top or the bottom eighth of that particular
swing. The above we can positively verify.

Such performances as these, coupled with the foregoing, are probably unparalleled
in the history of the Street.

James R. Keene has said, 'The man who is right six times out of ten will make his
fortune."

Here is a trader, who, without any attempt to make a showing (for he did not know
the results were to be published), established a record of over ninety-two per cent
profitable trades.

Mr. Gann has refused to disclose his method at any price, but to those scientifically
inclined he has unquestionably added to the stock of Wall Street knowledge and
pointed out infinite possibilities.

We have requested Mr. Gann to figure out for the readers of The Ticker a few of the
most striking indications which appear in his calculations. In presenting these we

wish it understood that no man, in or out of Wall Street, in infallible.

Mr. Gann's figures at present indicate that the trend of the stock market should,
barring the usual rallies be toward lower prices until March or April, 1910.

65
He calculates that May wheat, which is now selling at $1.02, should not sell below 99
cents and should sell at $1.45 next spring.

On cotton, which is now at about the 15 cent level, he estimates that, after a good
reaction from these prices, the commodity should reach 18 cents in the spring of
1910. He locks for a corner in the March or May option.

Whether these figures prove correct or not, will in no sense detract from the record
which Mr.Gann has already established.

Mr. Gann was born in Lufkin, Texas, and is thirty-one years of age. He is a gifted
mathematician, has an extraordinary memory for figures, and is an expert Tape
Reader. Take away his science and he would beat the market on his intuitive tape
reading alone.

Endowed as he is with such qualities, we have no hesitation in predicting that within
a comparatively few years William D. Gann will receive full recognition as one of
Wall Street's leading operators.

Note: - Since the above forecast was made, Cotton has suffered the expected decline,

the extreme break having been 120 points. The lowest on May wheat thus far has
been $1.01-5/8. It is now selling at $1.06-1/4.

66
Repeating aspects, Gann Planets and Soybeans

If you want to trade like Gann you have to learn his method and his method is the
planets and their positions when highs and lows are made.

Gann used repeating aspects in ‘Robert Gordons great Campaign in cotton’ from
his book ‘The Tunnel thru the air’

He used the planets to form the same shape or pattern again that was observed at
the markets high or low but used different planets to achieve this.

June 25th 1927.
October cotton declined to 16.80
Bought 500 October at 16.83 and 500 December at 17.15.
He figured that it would run up for about thirty days.

July 25th 1927.
Sold 500 October cotton at 19.00
Sold 500 December at 19.20
Went short 500 December at 19.20.
Decline followed as he expected.

To understand the reason for the timing of these trades just imagine a
triangle and at each corner there is a planet. This is called a grand trine.
What is happening in this case is that there are two slow planets that
don't move much and they are 120 degrees apart(trine)

Then a fast planet, Mercury in this case comes around so that it forms a

triangle with the other planets (at the low of the market)

it moves away so that there is no grand trine anymore but a month later

the Sun comes around to where Mercury use to be and forms the triangle again (at
the high of the market)

So from the above you can see the planets form the same shape again but use
different planets. The next example is from May soybeans. I will show you how an
opposition with a conjunction in the middle was found at both the low and the high
of the swing.

May soybeans had a low of 460 on 13th Dec 1999 and ended on 28th January 2000
at 538. On the hexagon chart 460 and 538 are beside each other.

On Dec 13th Mars was conjunct (joined with) Uranus, This was happening exactly
at 90 degrees to Venus and Saturn which were both opposite each other.

This is what it looked like.

67
Low on Beans 13th December 1999

So here we have Mercury replacing Mars and the Moon replacing Venus.This was
the only time in the whole price move where any planets could recreate the original
pattern that was at the low, couple that with exact price targets and thus a swing
was created in beans just as W.D.Gann said it would.

The Bradley Siderograph

The planets have been used as a market timing tool for many years. In the 1940’s an
American astrologer Donald Bradley developed a technique for combining the
planets into a single line calculation that he hoped would indicate the major highs
and lows for the year in the U.S. Stock Market.

This he named ‘The Bradley Siderograph’

The details are published in his book 'Stock Market Prediction’ subtitled "The
Planetary Barometer and How to Use It' available from Llewellyn Publications.

The basic formula for the calculation follows. You will see that it is very time
consuming to do by hand but there are several computer programs that are
available that will even allow you to change Bradleys formula, so that you can
weight the inputs that you feel are the most relevant.

Bradleys basic formula is this, for every planet, measure the distance between that
planet and every other planet (excluding the Moon), and see if it's within a 15 degree
orb of a Conjunction, Sextile, Square, Trine, or Opposition. If so it is given a
weighted value all depending on the aspect and it's distance from exact. Squares and
oppositions are minus, sextiles and trines are plus, conjunctions have different
weightings depending on the planets involved.

When there is an aspect within orb, take the distance between the two planets (in
degrees), subtract the number from 15 and then divide the result by 15, next
multiply the result by 10.

An aspect which is exact gets a value of 10 and 0 if at a 15 degree orb. The
weightings increase as the aspect becomes more exact.

This calculation is done for 36 planetary combinations, excluding the Moon.

The 36 combinations are separated into intermediate and long term cycles, with the
10 combinations of Jupiter through Pluto considered the long term, the other 26
represent the medium term cycles.

Next add the sum of the declinations of Venus and Mars, assign a positive value for
northern declinations, negative for southern declinations. Add the values for both
Venus and Mars and divide by two.

Add together all the long-term weights for the 10 long term cycles, (divided by two),
and multiply this number by 4. Then add all the weights for the 26 intermediate
term cycles and the Venus and Mars declination and this final number is the
Siderograph on any one day.

Transits to Natal Charts

A Natal (Birth) chart can be created from several points in the market life of a
commodity, stock or index. Such points would be the first trading day, the date of a
major high or low, the incorporation date of a company or when there was major
news that effected that entity such as a currency being allowed to free float as
opposed to being of fixed value.

What we are looking for is a build up of energy from the current planets as they
pass over or make angles to the natal chart.

One transit is not enough, I like to see at least three points on the natal chart that
are being stimulated by the current planets transits.

Here are two real life examples from Soybeans.
The first chart is the 1997 Soybean high and the second chart is the Soybean high

September 7 1999. Chart three is an overlay of charts One and two showing their
interlocking similarities.

Using the same 1997 high chart I predicted that May 5th would be another Soybean
high, the actual high was May 3".

The reasons for this were because of the general look of energy to the combined

IBM Low
Mars was opposite Jupiter at the high and is now trine.

The Sun takes up Mars position at the high by being opposite Jupiter
making this a repeating aspect.

This move in IBM has been a combination of techniques, repeating aspects and
transit to natal chart. This blend of techniques is fairly common.

In Summary there has to be a build up of energy to the natal chart from current
transits plus the Super Timing patterns. I will often combine natal charts from
major highs and lows over many years to get the right picture that will also blend in
with the current transits. This tips me off when to expect bigger reversals than

normal.

Jupiter Ingress and Soybeans

There are many different types of fixed cycles one of these is when Jupiter is at 90,
180, 270 and 360 degrees. These degrees are the ingress points that lie on the
cardinal cross. The following charts show some examples of Soybeans over the years
since 1951.

A simple entry method would be a moving average cross over or a trend line break.
I have marked the first two charts in the series with a trend line so that you can get
an idea of what I mean.

Day Trading the S+P with Astrological Aspects

Aspects occur during and out of market hours. To use an overnight aspect, add
either twelve or six hours to bring the time into market hours.

An aspect timed for two minutes to eleven on Thursday night is used the next day

at two minutes to eleven on Friday morning. An aspect at twenty past six Friday
morning is used by adding six hours and bringing it up to twenty past twelve Friday
afternoon.

The charts that follow are from one week in March 2001. I have used an aspectarian
to give me the exact times based on these charts which have New York time even
though the pit is in Chicago.

Chart Patterns

Pattern 3

Pattern 3

A pattern 3, which is a five wave triangle, is a highly
reliable end pattern and occurs frequently. Wave ais by
far the longest price wave. Wave a may consist of three
waves or five waves.

Wave b, wave c, wave d and wave e
e will have similar price range,
e will possibly skew, and
* will show similar subdivisions.

Wave e will be very brief timewise unless wave e is in
itself a smaller five wave triangle. The entry to a pat-
tern 3 is a break of wave d.

Pattern 3 can be a high or a low.

There was a pattern 3 high at the beginning of the chart on the 5" and 6"
as well as the low marked as it was in progress.

Failed Signals

The following charts demonstrate trend line breaks that work well or fail.

When a break of a trend line or a well defined support-resistance point breaks and
then the market reverses back in its original direction this failed break is in it self a
signal to get back on the original trend.

When the breakout price bar shows a large range this bar can be used as a stop
and reverse level. If the breakout bar just drifts through the trend line it is much
more risky and stops have to be under the recent congestion area.

Also the larger the time frame the more reliable the signals and profit potential.
These charts haven’t got every break or failure marked for clarity so you will find
other valid examples on the same charts.

Organization

The purpose of good organization is to,

a) Keep you focused.

b) Tell you when you are likely to trade.

c) Make sure you never miss a trade.

d) Keep you aware of your current financial position.

Your organization is in two areas, business management and trading.

Business

a) Keep a daily ledger showing the current state of your trading account
including cash and open positions.

b) Graph your equity weekly.

c) Check your brokers statements every time you receive them.

e) Write down all your orders to your broker and log the time and date they were
placed.

f) Tape all your telephone conversations with your broker in case of later disputes.

Trading Routine

a) Getting your price data.
b) Updating your time cycle data.
c) Reviewing your charts with your trading methods.
d) Writing down your trading plan which consists of
l.entry 2.exit 3. stop levels.
e) print price charts of your trades marking entry and exit, note why you traded.

On the following pages I have reproduced part of a trading routine that you could
modify to suit your situation. A good idea is to laminate a print out of your routine
and keep it at your desk for reference as you work.

The second page which is a list of your markets can be printed fresh each day so
that you can add your notes on current cycles, price levels for entry, exit and stops.
It is a simple tool but it certainly helps clarify your mind and allow you to focus on
your trading.

What is Realistic

I will assume that most traders enter the markets to make money rather than the
other possible reasons of a more psychological nature

Traders tend to focus on entry and exit methods rather than risk reward, also they
tend to over estimate the amount of money they can earn from the amount of capital
that they have available.

Taxes

On the next charts I’ve marked the sort of moves possible in the markets so you can
compare them with the number of points you need to make for different monetary
goals.

Two immediate conclusions can be drawn from this,

don’t leave your day job until you have plenty of trading experience and

you will need to eventually trade multiple contracts to make any kind of decent
living.

A Glossary of Astrological Terms

Air: One of the four Elements. (Fire, Earth, Air, Water)

Applying: When the distance between two Planets in aspect is narrowing towards an
exact aspect, the aspect is said to be an applying aspect. An orb of 179 degrees would
be moving toward [applying aspect] the exact aspect value of 180 degrees and an orb
of 182 degrees would be moving away from [separating aspect] the exact orb of 180
degrees.

Ascendant: Follow the horizontal line on the natal chart wheel to the left where it
intersects with the wheel. The Zodiacal Sign located here on the Cusp of the first
House is the Rising Sign, and this sign and its number of degrees are called the
Ascendant. It represents your way of expressing yourself in action. This is one of the
four main horoscope angles of the chart wheel, which are considered sensitive
points. These four angles are located at the very leftmost point (Ascendant), the very
rightmost point (Descendant), the top (Midheaven or MC), and the bottom (Nadar
or IC [Imum Coli]) of the chart wheel.

Aspect Configurations: Patterns of aspected Planets, such as a Stellium, Grand
Trine, Grand Cross, T-Square, or Yod. These patterns point to major issues,
talents, and challenges within one's nature.

Aspect: The angular separation between two bodies, measured along a great circle,
is termed Aspect. Each one of a set of specific number of degrees has an Astrological
name and symbol and describes a way in which the energies of the two bodies
influence each other. In additions, certain groups of aspects have specific names

eg Stellium, Grand Trine, Grand Cross, T-Square, Yod, etc

Asteroids: The effects of the Asteroids have been studied, much as the effects of the
Planets, and they may well be the remains of an exploded planet. Ceres, Pallas,
Juno, and Vesta were the first four asteroids discovered, but there are hundreds.

Astrological Chart: Any chart calculated for a specific time and place. A Natal chart
is calculated for the time and place of a person's birth: A Transit chart calculates
the position of the Planets at a specific time and place (such as an specific event). A
Progressed chart calculates the position of the Planets at specific time and place and
places these "progressed" positions of the Planets within the Natal chart. This gives
valuable information on how the present positions of the Planets are affecting any
person's unique natural patterns.

Astrological Sign: There are 12 Signs of the Zodiac.

142
Benefics: An old term applied to the Planets Sun, Venus, and Jupiter by traditional
Predictive Astrology;thought to bring "good luck".

Birth Data: The personal information required to calculate a Natal chart; the year,
month, day, exact time, and geographical location of a person's birth.

Cardinal: The four basic Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water) can each act in one
of three basic ways, or Modes,Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable.

Chart Ruler: The Planet that rules the Sign on the Ascendant of your Natal chart is
called the Chart Ruler and ts placement in your chart strongly affects all other parts
of the chart.

Chiron: A minor Planet discovered in 1977, Chiron is located between the orbits of
Saturn and Uranus. It appears to be associated with expanding consciousness and
powers of healing and properties like the Moon.

Daily Motion: Each Planet moves at a different speed through the sky and each has
an average amount of movement per day.

Descendant: The point in a natal chart opposite to the Ascendant.

Declination: The number of degrees a body is North or South of the Equator is its
declination. Parallels are aspects in declination, and the effect is considered to be
similar to a conjunction.

Detriment: (see below, Dignity:)

Dignity: A Planet's dignity basically refers to the strength of its position in the chart.
A Planet is strong, or said to be Dignified, when in a sign that it rules it is said to be

exalted when in specific signs, or to be in its fall or detriment when in other certain
signs.

Elements: Fire, Earth, Air, Water.

Fixed: The four basic Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water) can each act in one of
three basic ways or Modes, Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable.

Geographical Coordinates: The geographical coordinates, the longitude and latitude
of a geographical location, are necessary to construct a chart and may be found in
an Atlas.

Geocentric Planets: As seen from the center of the planet.

Glyph: An astrological symbol. Throughout this booklet you will see the glyphs for
the signs of the Zodiac, for the Planets, and for aspects.

143
Grand Cross: An aspect configuration in which four planets form four squares and
two oppositions in the chart. This configuration shows inner power and strength,
and where and what will intensely challenge them to be developed.

Grand Trine: An aspect configuration in which three planets are trine each other,
usually in the same element.

This configuration indicates an easy energy, "good luck" without effort. If no other
aspect challenges here, there may be an inclination to move on one's charm or luck
rather than to develop inner potentials.

Heliocentric Planets: As seen from the center of the Sun.

Horoscope Angles: There are four main horoscope angles in the chart wheel, which
are considered sensitive points. These four angles are located at the very leftmost
point (Ascendant), the very rightmost point (Descendant) , the top (Midheaven or
MC), and the bottom (Nadar or IC [Imum Coli]) of the chart wheel.

House System: The band of sky in which the Planets move is called the Zodiac. The
Zodiac is divided into 12 signs, each of which contains 30 degrees (1/12th of a circle).
Each sign represents a specific energy pattern and has a corresponding House. The
House represents the field of experience, the arena, in which the energy pattern

of the Sign acts in your life. Each House has a Planet which is its natural ruler and
your Natal chart will have your own planet that rules each sign.

There are at least fourteen methods of calculating houses. The methods are named
after the inventors of the system. Some of the most used house systems are; Koch,
Campanus, Placidus, Equal, Porphrey and Eridan.

IC: See Nadir:

Kite: An aspect configuration where a Planet opposes one of the Planets in a Grand
Trine. This opposing Planet can supply the challenge and the channel for the Grand
Trine energies.

Malifics: Old time predictive astrology considered Mars and Saturn to be bad luck.
If you do not work with the insistant energy of these Planets, the friction caused by
your resistance can be felt in your life as pain, bad luck, etc., but it's as much the
lack of awareness that causes the problem as it is the energy pattern itself.

Midheaven (MC): One of the four mundane points in the chart, the midheaven is
located at the highest point overhead; the cusp of the 10th house.

Mutable: The four basic Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water) can each act in one
of three basic ways, or Modes, Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable.

144
Mutual Reception: When each of two Planets is in the Sign ruled by the other, a
relationship is formed that acts much like a conjunction. (example; The sun [ruled
by Leo] is in Cancer and the Moon [ruled by Cancer] is in Leo.)

Nadir (IC or Imum Coli): Cusp of the 4th house. This is one of the horoscope angles.
The IC is thought to be a transformation point in the chart.

Natal Chart: An Astrological chart calculated for the time, date, and geographical
location of a specific person.

Native: A term sometimes used by astrologers to refer to the person for whom a
reading is being given.

Node: The location of the nodes can be calculated for each planet, but in practice the
term usually refers to the North and South nodes of the Moon. The Location of the
nodes of the moon give information about our life's work. The North Node
represents the ideals toward which we are moving, and the South node represents
the gifts we bring from the past; the things that we already know how to do well.

Orb: The number of degrees from exact allowed for an aspect.

Part of Fortune: A calculated point in space said to indicate, by House placement,
where a person's talents lie.

Planet Positions: The Sign and House position of a Planet within an astrological
chart.

Progression: The Natal horoscope reveals the energy patterns imprinted on us at the
time of birth. There are several methods by which the planetary positions are moved
(progressed) forward (or backward) in time, and their energy patterns can be seen
to activate Natal patterns. This Technique shows inner growth potentials.

PRIMARY PROGRESSION: One degree is added to the natal Planet's position for
each year of real time.

SECONDARY PROGRESSION: One day's planetary movement equals one year of
real time.

Quadrant: The circle of the 360 degree chart is divided into four quadrants. Each
quadrant represents an arena of experience. First equals intuition, second equals
emotion or feelings, third equals sensation and fourth equals thinking.

Relocation: The computation of a chart for a given time, using a different

(relocated) longitude and latitude. (For example: if one lives in a different place than
the birthplace.)

145
Retrograde Planets: When a Planet appears to move backward as seen from the
earth it is said to be retrograde. This will be marked on a Natal Chart, for example,
by a R after the Planet, sign, and degrees notation. The energy patterns of a
retrograde Planet tend to be experienced more on an internal level than those
experienced by direct movement.

Ruler: Each Sign of the Zodiac and each of the 12 Houses are associated with a
specific Planetary energy, and is said to be ruled by that Planet. The Planet that
rules the sign on the Ascendant is called the Chart Ruler.

Separating: When the distance between two Planets in aspect is widening away from
the exact, it is said to be a separating aspect.

Sidereal Zodiac: The measuring system in which a Planet is measured in
relationship to a background of fixed stars.

Solar Arc: An angular distance between the Natal Sun and the secondary
progressed Sun that is used for a technique called solar arc directions.

Stellium: An aspect configuration where at least 4 planets are located within 8
degrees of the next Planet, and in the same Sign, indicating a strong area of focus in
the chart.

Synastry: The art of chart comparison between 2 people in order to understand
relationships.

Transiting Planets: Transits refer to the current position of the planets. These
positions relative to the Natal placement of Planets give information about what
energy patterns in the Natal Chart are now being activated.

T-Square: A configuration of Planets in aspect; two opposing Planets are square a
third Planet. All are usually in the same mode. This configuration indicates a high
degree of motivation and ability to achieve, and a difficulty staying balanced. The
focal point of the aspect holds the key to what issues are involved.

Tropical Zodiac: The measuring system in which planetary longitudes are
measured against the point in the sky where the Sun is on the first day of Spring.
This is the system most used in Western Astrology.

Uranian Astrology: A system of Astrology that uses sensitive points in the chart to
understand the horoscope. In addition to the traditional sensitive points (Sun,
Moon, Planets, Ascendant, Moon's Nodes), this system also uses the Transneptunian
Planets, midpoints, and a 90 degree wheel. The Transneptunian Planets are;
Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Appollon, Vulcanus, and Poseidon. This system
appears to be particularly effective in Medical Astrology.

146
Vertex: An experimental horoscope angle, or sensitive point. As the horizon divides
the chart into up and down, the vertex divides it into back and front.

Zodiac: The band of sky in which the Planets move is called the Zodiac. The Zodiac
is divided into 12 signs, each of which contains 30 degrees (1/12th of a circle). There
are two Zodiac systems, the Tropical Zodiac and the Sidereal Zodiac.

Tropical Zodiac: The measuring system in which planetary longitudes are measured
against the point in the sky where the Sun is on the first day of Spring.

Sidereal Zodiac: The measuring system in which a Planet is measured in
relationship to a background of fixed stars.

ascending troughs. The more times a trendline has been hit increases the
significance of a break in the trendline. It can be either support or resistance.

UPTREND: A tendency for rising prices in a market.

VEGA: The measurement of how much an option’s price changes for a 1% change
in volatility.

VERTICAL SPREAD: An options strategy which is also a spread where the options

SUPER TIMING

W.D. Ganns Astrological Formula for Stocks and Futures.

In SUPER TIMING this formula is shown in detail. All of Ganns public predictions
were analysed to reveal the one common factor.
Supertiming explains all of Ganns predictions by using the one formula.

It shows you which planet will be signaling the next trend turn and it works on all
markets.

As well as Ganns timing method there is the price target method

which is demonstrated by his predictions and from real life examples in recent
markets (this is not a planets longitude converted to price)

There are still many people who think that W.D. Gann used only

swing charts, angles or fixed time periods.

None of these can be used to consistently explain all his public predictions.

The real answer is in Super Timing where you will learn the pattern combination
that is found in all of Ganns predictions both long and short term. You will see how
this works on a swing basis as we work through whole sequences of short term
trades that Gann actually did. Nothing has been omitted

You will see why he entered the market when he did and the reason he took profits
only to re enter at a better price the next day.

The markets covered are coffee soybeans and cotton but

the same method works on any market and more importantly

it is still working today.

When you take the time to study Super Timing you will prove to yourself that this
really is the best timing method available.

The method is actually quite easy to learn as there is no complex Astrology (it is
based only on the positions of the planets as seen from earth and their angular
relationships)

I have a freeware program for you that will do all the calculations

There is also Ganns price target system that solves the price part of the formula.
