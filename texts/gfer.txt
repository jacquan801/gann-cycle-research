Since the death of W. D. Gann in 1955, the legend and mystery surrounding this great market
master has continued to grow umtil it has today reached legendary status. One must ask why
the status of the legacy of one so difficult to understand in his written teachings that the
majority of people who approach his books and courses either give up cight away or spend
yours, even decades, in an aime dosessive search to undersumnd the theories of tits
emgimatic man, Certamly Gann himsetf is responsibke for creating much of this legend
beginning with the his interview in the 1909 Ticker & Investment Digest, the precursor of the
Walt Street Journal, where, under observation, he made 286 trades of which 264 were
profitable and only 22 sosers. He explains his success as being based upon a sciemific “Law
of Vibration”, an imtegrated empirical science based upon mathematics, and natural
philosophy, and at that point the legend was born.

[t would be over 10 yeacs before Gann began his writing career producing seven books and
many bundreds of pages of advanced stock and commodky market courses, containing varied
kvels of revelation of his market secrets accordingly as the student paid higher ead higher
peices, with his Number Three Master Forecasting Method going for $2,500 in 1939, and
otber of his “complete” courses priced at $5,000, with these prices excluding his greatest
secrets like the Matheanatical Formula For Market Predictions and his astrological system.

Whal is most perplexing, however, is that even today, with access 10 most of these rares! and
valuable of Gann’s teachings publicly available at far more affordable prices than in Gann’s
time, there are still very, very few individuals who have been able to master, let alone even
profitably appty most of Gann’s analytical techniques. One wonders whether there were not
further courses which explained even more clearly the inner mechanisins of Gann’s systems,
and there are certainly rumors that such courses did indeed exist. There are subjects like
astrology, which are know to have been wsed by Gann, the clues to which may de found
scattered throughout all of his work, yet there is no explicit instruction on the use of aay such
method anywhere to be found. Evea the “Law of Vibration” is almost never referred to again
after the 1909 interview, and there is no mstroction on the application of natural science in
his work, Yet, anyone who has studied these subjects is fully aware that these scientific and
metaphysical pcincipks provide the fundamental basis to cvety eleaneat of Gann’s theory.

‘What is most surprising i modem Gann research is that there are so few analysts who follow
Gann’s clues and look to the underlying principtes behind his theories. One finds tradezs
uselessly drawing “Gann Angles” on the charts without having the slightest sense of their
meaning or true purpose. The following course was written to rectify this problem, and to
“unveil” the mystery of Gann Analysis by revealing the scientific foundations upon which it
is based, and their integrated application to crading and forecasting, Outside of the work of
Dr. Jerome Baumring, and the classic market masters, this is the first work we have seen of a
standard of quality that lives up to that of the Master, W. D, Gann, himself:

The Secret of Gann A

Much has been published regarding WD Gann's use of geometrical angles. Today,
many software programs (incorrectly} have these angles as standard features for technical
analysis. However, few (if any) people know what ibey really are or how to actually use
them. 1 have heard so many stories about these angles that if is clear to me that they are
completely misunderstood, Some will say that your charts have to be scaled to a
particular price incremsem to square out the chart. Others will say that it is based purely
on geometry and because the Tangent of 45 is 1 then this omust be tbe real 1 x 1 angle.
The funny thing is both arguments are correct but not completely correct in a Gann sense!
First, lets examine what Gann actually said about this subject:

“After king years of practical experience, I have discovered that Geometrical Angles

measure accurately Space, Time, Volume, and Price.

Mathematics is the only exact science, a3 I have said before. Every nation on the face
of the earth agrees that 2 and 2 meke 4, no matter what Sanguage it speaks, Yet all other
sciences are not in accord as mathematical science. We find different men in different
professions along scientific fines disagreemg on problems, but there can be no
disagreement in mathematical calculation.

These are 360 degrees in a circke, no matter bow Large or how small the circle may be.
Certain numbers of these degrees and angles are of vast importance and indicate when
important tops and bottoms occur on stocks, as well as denote important Resistance

.
Levels. When once you have thoroughly mastered the Geometrical Angles, you will be
able to solve any problem and determine the trend of any stock.”

* We use geometrical angles to messure Space and Time periods because it is a shorter
and quicker method then addition or muhiphication, provided you follow the rules and
draw the angles or lines accurately from tops and bottoms or extreme highs and lows.”

Gann ieft several clues in this introduction to geometrical angles in his veiled
language. Did you spot them? Why was Gam so particular when it came to drawing his
charts? What did he mean when he said that (hese angles are a shorier and quicker
method provided that you follow the rules? OK, that is esough: I will translate this mio
common English.

There are 360 degrees in a cycle (planetary orbit, “space movemert”), no matter how
large or how small the cycle may be. Certain divisions of these degrees (aspects) are of
vast importance. This is why be was so meticulous sbout bis charis, He was scaling
them to the planetary orbits or cycles be found useful for cach stock and commodity. |
unit of price / day = the motion of tbe Earth around the Sun. 1 unit of price / week = to
the quarter Moon cycle. 1 unit of price / month = the orbit of Satum which is also the
seeret to the hexagon or cube chart but that’s anotber matter. To prove that this
interpretaion is correct we will study Gann's coffee letter to 9 private student. 1 have
provided a copy of this letter and would encourage you to read it first before reading my

analysis! Gann has some mistakes in this ktter and it is my belief that they were
intentional since the math was basic and in his other published works it's hard to find

even a single spelling error.

“Tr making my predictions, ] use geometry and mathematics, just as the astronomer does,
based on immutable laws”, WD Gann, 1927 Tunnel Toru the Air.

Analysis of Gaun’s Coffee Letter

First off some basic Astronomical or Astrology background is needed. There are 360
degrees in the circle of the Zodiac, The zodiac is divided mto 12 equal parts of 3
degrees each. The starting poim is Aries where the sun crosses the ecliptic at the March
21% Vernal Equinox. Then come Taurus, Gemini, Canwer (Summer Solstice), Leo, Virgo,

Litea (Autumnal Equinox), Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn (Winter Solstice), Aquarius,

and Pieces.

010 30 Aries 7° 150 to 180 = Virgo M 300 to 330 = Aquarius =
3 to 66 = Taurus 180 to 210 = Libra & 330 to 360 = Pieces #
60 to 90 = Gemini IT 210 10 240 = Scorpio M, 360 = 0 Aries Y* agam
90 to 120 = Cancer 3 240 to 270 = Sagittarius 2

120 to 150 = Leo 2 270 to 300 = Capricorn Yp
In the Gust part of the letter, Gann starts breaking down the March 19, 1954 high price
into zodiac degrees, Using a scale of one point (mamimum tick) to one-degree 8729 equals
29 Gemini. 8729 ticks divided by 360 = 24.247, Therefore we reject 24 circles or 360 *
24 = 8640, This aves us with $729 minus 8640 = 89. Because Gemini starts a 60-
degrees we get 89 — 60 = 29 Gemini. Using | cent to one degree 87.29 = 27-degrees 17
minutes of Gemini because 87,29 - 60 = 27.29 and 0.29 * 60 = 17. There are 60 minules
to a degree just as there are 60 minutes to an hour or 60 seconds to a minute,

The next line says, “ Using a scale of 30 points (Saturn) to one degree, equals 21
Capricorn.” 8729/30 = 291 and because Capricorn starts al 270 degrees of the zodiac 291
— 210 = 21, Thirty is the trumber of years it izes Saturn to complete a single orbit acound

the Sun and this is why Gann used 30 points to a degree.

The doWar Value $28,171 again is in Capricom 28,171 — 27,000 (zero Capticom) = IL 45
Capricorn. One could also argue that this value is 28 Aries depending upon the decimal
pom.

The average of the 5 options on March 19, 1954 was 8663. The average of the 5
options on March 19, £954 was actually 8668. Here Gann makes a mistake, and be is also
intentionally vague with how he came up with the zodiac degree. But here is the answer
8668 divided by 12 (Iupiter’s orbit in years) = 722.333 seject the two circks or 720
degrees and you get 2°20" Aries, Which is 90 degrees (not 60) or square to helio Jupiter.
Actually, if you caloulate this angle exactly, you get 87°15" or 8715! Note: at the bottom
of the letter, Gann shows the longitude of Heliocentric-Jupiter as 29°35" Gemini. This

means that the current price of 8729 at one tick per degree, i.e. the minimum fluctuation
is equal to 29° Gemini. This is within a half of'a degree to being exactly equal to Jupiter's
longitude. Helio-Uranus is af 21° 52° Cancer and ibe Satum price at 21° Capricom is
opposite to this iocation. In astrology, the squares and the opposition pomms are strong
negative / resistant forces. [t is nol my intention to teach Astrology, as there are
aumetous books on the sudject but it is an important sybject for understanding W.D.
Gann and the subject was a dominant feature in Gann’s suggested reading list.

In the next {wo paragraphs, Gann starts throwing out all kinds of points per month
without any explanation as to whry he is using the numbers or the significance of the
numbers. It appears to be random and of no use to the student. Again, 1 believe this is
imentional, as Gam was known for making his student work through his examples to
gain understanding. Based on many of today’s Gann experts I’m confident Gann’s
geometric angles are still veiled in perpetual misunderstanding. Now we will remove the
moystery.

Definition: The True Gawn Angles are the minimum fluctuation of the underlying
commodity, stock, or mdex mukipbed by the number of years it takes a planet to
compkte a full 360 degree orbs. This value defines the 45-degree angle. All of the other
angles are calculated from this master angle by dividing the value by 45° to get a price to
degree valuc. ‘This unifies @ relationship with both price and time and is a Vector that can
be projected into the future. Lets look at an example that will show where Gann is
coming up with the numbers in his letter and bow be is creating planetary orbit vectors

thet unite price with time.

It takes Satur 30 years to complete an orbit around the Sun. The minimum
fluctuation in coffee is 1 tick so 30 * | = 30 and therefore the 45 degree angle = 30 points
or ticks ‘one degree of Saturn. The price degree ratio is 30 / 45 = 0.666667 so as an
example, the 75 degree angle would = 75 *, 666667 of 50 points / degree of Saturn.
(Gann said in the coffee Letter: “that at 50 pts, Per month the 45 —degree angle would
crass a 8715 on March 19, 1954”. The math shows us that the $0 points per month
number comes from Gann's 75=degree angle not the 45), However, Gann said that this
date was 276 months from April 16, 1931 low of $435, If you multiply 276 * 50, you get
13,800, so this is an etror or typo. At 3¢ points per month you get 276 *30 = 8280 + the
435 low equals Gann’s calculation of 8715! Gann also says in the letter that from May
15, 1940 to March 19, 1954 — Saturn moved 181°35", which gives a price of 6990. This is
another typo! Converting 81°35” to a decimal, we ger 181.583. This amount times 30 is
$447.5, If you add this to ibe May 15, 1940 low of $544 you get 5990 not 6990, He then
says at 45 points per degree that 181°35* of Satum would yield 8715. Why did he use 45
points to a degree? Because it is his 67-14? angle based upon Saturn’s orbit. 181.583° *
45 =$8171.235 + the $544 low = $715! Here is the calculation for the 45 points per
depres. The 67 and 4 degree angle is 67.5 * 0.666667 = 45 points / degree of Satum. A
GO-degree angle would be 60*. 666667 or 40 points / degree. Can yau see why Gann was
using these numbers or points per degree in his letter? All of the other Gann angles are

calculated in this fashion, For convenience, the other angles that Gana used are:

& 86.25

Side Note: This tangent issue has been confusing fot many Gann students. A friend of
mine Ken Tuskin, recently figured out that Gann took a square ihat was 12 by 12 and
drew an arc on the inside of this square from the top Jef hand comer to the bottom right
hand comer, i.¢. the height of the square is the radius of the arc and the lower Jef hand
comet of the square would represent the center of this arc. If you do this on graph paper,
you will find that alt the infamous 1 X t, 2X 1, 1X 2, etc., will all be 3.75° apart? Why
did Gann choose this particular square? The largest planet in the solar system is Jupxer,
in fact, Jupiter is larger in mass than all of the remaining 8 planets corubined. Jupiter
takes 12 years 10 orbit the sun and the number tweive is mentioned muitiple times in the
Bible Le. twelve tribes of Israel, twelve Aposttes, etc. [n terms of music, there are 12 and
only 12 notes. You can have an infinite variation in terms of frequency (by multiplying or

dividing by 2) but there are still only 12 tones or vibeations! Getting back to Jupiter, his
price degree ratio is 12/45 or 0,266. The reciprocal of Uns is 140.266 or 45°/12, equals
3.75°. On page 82 of Fhe Tommel Tory The Air, Gann says, “To those who understand
numbers, ‘266" reveals some remarkable events thal are to follow the election of the
Pope”. This is interesting since [2/45 = 0,266. The Galactic center is 266 or 26-

To make sure that you understand the concept of Gann’s Angles, let’s say you want to

figure the 60-degree angle for a NYSE listed stock far the planet Jupiter.

Answer: Jupiler takes 12 years to complete one orbit.
The mmimum fluctuation of most stocks is an eighth:

12°0.125 = $1.50 pet one degree of Jupiter for the 45 degree angle. $1.50/45 = 0.033333
price degree ratio. 60° * 0.03333 = 42.00 /I degree of Jupiter. So lets say the low price
took place one year ago and Jupiter has since moved 28° degrees. 28° * 2 = $56.00 price
up from Zero. If the low was $22.75, then we would also look at the price 56 + 22.75 =
$78.75. Also note that the square of the low would be $22.75/0.125 = 182° degrees of
the Sun, lunar quarters, Jupitez, Saturn and Solar years. Note that the entire zadiac is
360° and that 360 * 1/8 is 45°. Therefore, $45.00 is equal to 360° in 1/8” increments or
1/8™ per degree scale. The price low of $22.75/45 = 0.5055555 and 360°°0.5055555 =
182° ox 2° Libra of $22.75/0,125 = 182°. $22.75/51,50 (hupiter scale) * $15.166 and this
in degrees would be $15,166/45 = 0.33703703 and 360° * 033703703 is 121,33, which
equals 121°20° of the circle or 1°20" Leo, We would watch the stock closely as Jupiter
casts aspects {especially 90, 180, 270-degrees) to the Jongitude date of the low, ic. 1°20”
Leo. The Satum conversion would work out like this 30 * .125 = $3.75 and $22.75/83.75

= $6.0666, This amount divided by 45 is 6.6066/45 = 0.13481481 and this multiplied by
360*s 48.53 or 48°32" of the circle, which is 18°32" Taurus. This is the same procedure
illustrated im the coffee letter with the only difference being that stocks have a different
minimum shuctuation (vibration) than coffee. Because $22.75/0.125 (an 8*) = 182°
degrees we would project tbe orbits of the planets this amount into the future which is a
44 complete orbit or opposition aspect plus 2 extra degrees. As an example, let’s say that
Mercury was at 3-degrees of Scorpio on the date of the ow. We would simply go through
an ephemeris and find Mercury at 5-degrees of Taurus, which is 182-degrees from our
first date, Then we would add the 182 degrees again, which would be 5-Scorpio, and this
would be another important date for a trend change. We would do this with all the
planets knowing that as each one moves 182°Im longitude they are squaring the low price
by time. I believe this is how Gann converted price to time and to my knowledge this
techaique has never been published in any written form. I will talk ebout this subject
further when I cover Gann’s Squaring o with Time or Coa

Longitude. It is extremely impottant that you understand this concept to it’s fullest. The
Gann Angles along with planetary time/price relationships are the Hey to converting
prices to degrees in the zodiac. From the few examples that exist, and oty own
experiments with the techmque, & appears that * is important that the price conversion
has an angular or astrology aspect relationship to the specific planet you used to convert
the price. Then a secondary factor would be if other planets hed an angular relationship
to the same degree. We can see this in Gann's exarnple above where the price of the 5
coffee options converted to the Jupiter scale are making a square aspect to the current
heliocentric position of Jupiter. Also on this particular day, heliocentric Jupiter is square

.

10 the Earth (or geocentric Sun} and the North Node of the Moon is at 20° 37° Capricom
conjunct tbe Saium converted Price, which is in opposition to Uranus in Cancer. Also
$729 al { tick per degree is at 29° of Gemini, which is the current location of Hebocentric
Jupiter. I have seen many people use pure zodiac longitude converted fo price and there is
nothing wrong with (his technique if the price scales workout and have some
mathematical relationship. However, it is extremely important that you understand the
method of converting price based upon planetary orbits, especially the big guys Jupiter &

Saran.

Another important timing feature of this coffee letter, that was not discussed and 10
my knowledge was never disclosed by WD. Gann, has to do with Geocentric Jupiter and
the eclipse of the Sun that took place on January 5® 1954. I will discuss this again in
detail when ] get to the analysis of Tamnel Thr The Air, but for now we wilt illustrate
this set up. If we look up the geocentric position of Jupiter during the eclipse on January
5*, 1954 we will find the location to be 18° 33’ Gemini & in retrograde motion. On
March 18, 1954, Jupiter in direct motion returns to the exact location if had a1 the eclipse!
Providing the entry timing for the trade. In addition, Gann’s personal Horoscope for
Coffee (copy included) March 7 1882, has Satum at 8°38" degrees of Taurus. On March
19, 1954, (retrograde) Saturn is at $°34° of Scorpio in opposition (1 80-degrees) to natal
Satu. Jupiter's return to the eclipse location is Square to both the natal Sun and natal

Uranus in Gann’s coffee horoscope.

It is important to note thal this letter is one of the only known examples of the true
mathematical angles! Gann was about 74 years old when he wrote this letter and was
very ill, Also, the recipient of the letter was a private student who signed an agreement
with Gann not 10 reveal these rules and instructions ta anyone! Because we are kefl with
so little to go on we have 10 make some assumptions about using this technique. (1) From
the evidence available it seems that we should primarily use this method with the
following planets: Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun as these support the instructions in the
letter (1 also use Uranus because Uremus’s orbit divided by Jupiter's orbit = 7 & this
number is mentioned most in the Bible.). Chart examples of Soybeans & Cofite prove
that Gann also used Mars for geometric angles, The other planets are used for measuring
the time element and also for financial astrology. These three planets (Jupiter, Saturn and

the Sun) have a unique mathematical relationship with each other.

Ly id

In one year, Saturn moves about 12 degrees, the Sun moves 360, and Jupiter 30 and
there ere 12 months in the year of about 30 days each. Therefore we have a nice harmony
of numbers 360/12 = 30 which is the number of days in a month and the number of years
in Saturn's orbit. 360/30"12 which is Jupxter’s orbit in years and the number of months in
a year, Or inversely, 30° 12=360. 30/12 = 2.5 which is Jupitet's monthly average
movement. [n one month, the Sun will move 30 degrees, Sanu will move | degree and
the Moon will complete an orbit around the Earth, 12/30 = 0.40 and this amount times
360 = 144 or the square of [2 a very important Gann number! 144 * 2.5 will take us back
to 360, 144/2.5 = 144°2/360. If we square 144, Le. 144 * 144 = 20736, which Gann

called the great cyck because 20,736 days approximates the 3 conjunctions of Jupiter
with Satur. The geometric mean of Jupiter’s orbit & Satumn’'s orbit = Sqet. (12*30) =
18.9? years. This is equal to the Metonic Lunar Cycle, which causes Ful! Moons, New
Moons, and eclipses to occur a1 approximately the same calendar day and zodiac degree
every 19 years, The harmonic mean = 2*(12*30)/(12+30} = 17.143 years, (Readers of
Bradley Cowan's Four Dimeasiona) Stock Market Structures & Cycles will want to study
this m connection with his market cube theory as x relates directly to this time period),
which is en extremely important cycle in the markets. 17 years is refated to the Satum
cycle by the square root of 3 {diagonal of a cube). 17 years is related to Jupiter's orbit by
the square root of 2 (diagonal of a square). 17 years is one 5° of Uranus’s orbit. 17 years
is 9 times larger than the Mars cycle & also 1/9" of the Neptune’s cycle. 17 years
expressed in days is 6209. This number divided by 225 (Venus’s orbit in days} = 27.59
which is close to the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. There are 17 steps to the
entrance of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. The gum of the digits 1 through 17 = £53 {a
number that appears in the Pyramid and in the Bible mukiple times), Le. The Grand
Gallery is 153 feet long, the number of fish caught by Jesus' disciples was 153, Jesus"
public ministry lasted 918 days (153 *6). 153 equals 9 times 17. Note: The United States
was formed with the signing of The Declaration of Independence, July 1776. If we add
153 years or 9 cycles of 17, we get the year 1929 the Peak of a Major period of U.S.
economic expansion followed by the “Great Depression”. The Florids Bank Failures
occurred in Fuly of 1929, Working backwards 153 years from 1776, we pet the year 1623.
Another important cycie is 37 years. Thirty seven ts two complete Amar node cycks of
18.6 years, Two geometric mean cycles of Jupiter and Saturn, and is also 12 Cupitet’

3

orbit} mubiplied by Pi, Le. 12* 3.14 = 37. Adding 37 years to dates of major highs and
lows usually define future maior tuning points! Now that we have laid down this theory,
and have shown astronomica//astrological proof direct from Gann’s personal letter to a

private student let us now look at his non-astronomical approach.

Gano said that: “the first and most important angle 10 draw was the 45-degree angle
that moves up one point per day, one point per week or one point per month”. He says
that this is a 45 because it divides the space and time periods into 2 equal parts, As long
as the macket or a stock stays above the 45-degree angle, it is i a strong position and

indicates higher prices. Below the 45-degree angle indicates a weak position and lower

prices.

This is a very interesting quote because in terms of geometry these angles would all

have differen slopes and cauld not be equal {or 45-degrees). On the other side, in terms

of the concept of cycles the slopes are equal {1 unit of price / 1 unit of time) as each has a

common relationship with price / time which = the slope.

If we take the stock example above, the low prive of $22.75 would take 22.75 days

{Sun), Weeks (lunar quarters), Months (Saturn) and years. Let us say that the low

occurred on October 20 1987, Therefore we have the following: 22.75 days = November

11", 1987, 22.75 weeks = March 27", 1988 and 22.75 Months is September 11, 1989

(22.75 years would be out in Fuly 2010)

The lower portion illustrates the 45-degree lines up from zero and the upper balf
illustrates the 45 lines up from the low price of $22.75. 11 is easy 10 see that in terns of
traditional geometry that these trend lines are completely different. However, ali are
achieving the same objective of relating a time cycie to price. These are supposed to be

° the guidelines for determining the current position {strength or weakness) of a stock or
commodaty under analysis according to Gann’s instructions (Gann Angle Course, copy
inchided). This is another reason why I believe Gann actually used the planets. By using

~ tbe planets, he could simply look in an ephemeris and locate the dates that were related to
the price. However, based on this course, we would be interested in non-planetary
motion of 22.75 degrees (60mimntes *0.75 = 45 min.} i.e, 22-degrees, 45 minules or
22.75 days, weeks, months and years as is drawn out in the graph above. This seems to

contradict his coffee letter especially when we consider that the geometric angles are
supposed to be an easier and faster way lo measure “space movernent”, and this method

is certainly faster and easier. [f we use the instructions in the coffee letter we would need
182°-degrees or $ times as much space movement to balance price with time (remember .
the minimum fluctuation on stocks is an 8) with each 22°45” equaling L/8* of the actual

time cycle. Therefore, you would still get market hits using Gann's course instructions

because each turing point is the one-eighth harmonic of the actual price cycle in terms _
of degrees, longitude or time. However, you would never reafize that the second square

of price, ie. the second cyck of 22.75 days, weeks, months or years represesits only the

fist 90° of the price cycle, and the 4° square of price would be the opposition of 180°, -
etc., with 182 days, weeks, moms and years equaling the full 360°! The non-

astronomical approach is definitely faster and easier and will quickly put you in the

approximate time area to be on the bok out for market reversals or changes in trend. The ~
price expressed 9s a time cycle of solar years is the strongest cycle in terms of Gann’s

quick norrastronomical approach because it has the strongest correlation to an

astronomical relationship, ie. the Earth’s orbit around the Sum. If you take the harmonics >
of this cycle, or every 1/8" of 22.75 years, you would look for the stock to change trend

every 2.843 years. Lf you take the 1/8* harmonic of 2.843 years, you get 0.35546875 and

this multiplied by 365.25 (days in a year) is every 130 days. -

If we study tbe example in his geometric angle course, on page GA-16, we find bim

using $1 / month for U.S. Steel Corporation. He starts the angle up from the date of the

low (October of 1907) from a price of zero and the stock advanced (+240 or two
triangles) to a price of $261.75 ($+24°Capricorn) in 262 months (Degrees of Satur or
Lunar months?), Satum would have moved 275 degrees from 25 Pieces to 29 32
Sagatacius, 30 * 125 = $3.75/45 = 0.08333 * 11.25 (angle) = 9375 per degree of Satu
* 275 degrees = $257 &7/8ths (pretty close}. Lunar months would = 288 (the second
square of 12, or 144 * 2) and the 11.25 angle would cross at about $270, Using solar
months we get his answer of 262, However, tbe low in 1907 was late October around the
30* and this would really be $261. In any event, when the price of U.S. Steel met with
resistance at these levels and dropped below the (geometric angles) longitude price Ines,
it indicated weakness to Gann. Another very important part of this example is that the
time period in days is approx. 7980 divided by the low of $21.875 = 365 or a solar year.
Therefore: we take the low price of 21.875 and add it to the year 1907 and we get
1929.875, or the year 1929 + 7/8ths, 365 days * 0.875 = 320 days (7/8ths of'a year) and
this amount added too late October 1907 would put us in September of 1929 (Squaring
out Price with Time)! The price advance from the tow would = 262 — 22 = 240 or Trine
(120 + 120) a harmonic point in the circle, The price of $262 is equai to 22 Sagittarius
and geacentric Saturn is located at 23 55 Sagittarius on September 3, 1929. This means
that the price failure took place at the geocentric longitude of Saturn and thea fell below
the Heliccentric-Saturn angle @ $257 & 7/8ths during a time that was 2] & 7/8ths years
from the 1907 low of $21.875! As you can see from this explanation, there is a Jot of
detail between tbe lines of Gann’s example. Gann iefi clues but bo answers, He wanted
his students to discover the secrets of his methods by working through the techniques he
was describing and gaining knowledge from actually doing the work for themselves.
Make sure that you understand the above concepts & techniques before reading further. I

should also point out that the 1907 price low af $22.875 converted to degrees is
22.875/0.125 = 183° (3° Libra) and Heliocentric-Venus has since moved 12,783°. IEyou
reject the 35 circles or complete orbits, you get 183° or 3° Libra, ie. 12,783 ~ 12,600 =
183. The position of Heliocentric Saturn is 30° aspect ta the $261.875 (Phi *2), of 24°
Capticom and Heliocentric Mars a1 25°Libra is 90° aspect to the $261.875 price, Pluto is
at 18°06? Cancer, which is 75°aspect to the $22.875 (3°Libra) Jow. Jupiter and Vemus are
at 3°LS" and 6°43’ Gemini, respectively or 120°(Trine) the 1907 tow of 3*Libra. The
$261,875 in a Saturn scale is 18°40" Libea, which is square to Ptuto in Cancer and 45°to
Neptune at 1° Virgo. Gann’s angle course page GA-27 says, “U.S. Steel was incorporated
February 25, 190)”. If we look up the heliocentric positions of the planets on this date
(Natal Chart), and compare them with the positions on September 3, 1929, we get the
following astrological aspects; Uranus is near exact square nated Saturn, Mars is square
natal Mercury, Venus is square the natal Sun, Mercury is conjunct natal Uranus, Jupiter is
144° to natal Saturn and the Sun is 45* 10 natal Mercury. Most of these aspects are near

cant.

Now that we have explained these concepts leis get back to Gann’s Coffee letter:

> Aptil 16, 1931 to March 19, 1954 ~ Geocentric Saturn moved 285° & 38° minutes
(10 convert minutes in decimal form, you divide by $0). 38min‘60 = 0.633333
therefore, Sarurn moved 285.633, Because it takes Saturn 30 years 10 complete 1

orbit the 45-degree angie would equal

. 285.6333 * 30 = 8569. Gann has 8572, which is off by 3 ticks. Next he has
October 1, 1931 to March 19, 1954 - Geoventric Satum moved 231, which would
= 7230. Here again, Gann is trying to confuse and teach at the same lime. Here is
how he calculated this price: 231 * 30 = 6930. The low price on October 1, 193]
was $300 and 300 + 6930 = 7230, which is his price calculation. The next line
reads May 15, 1940 to March 19, 1954 — Saturn moved 181° & 35° minutes using
45 pois to 1 degree = 8715, This would be the 67 & '4-degree geometric angle
because 30/45 =

° 0.666667 for the Price/Degree ratio and 67.5 * 0.656667 = 45 points per degree.
45 * 181.583 = 8145.58 + the May 15, 1940 low price of 544 = 8715. The rest of

ibe geocentric calculations should be easy for you to understand at this point.

From bere, Gano moves on to the heliocentric degrees traveled by Saturn. With the
background that I have given you, it should be extremely simple to see where Gann is
generesing these price levels. One very interesting discovery that I made in the process of
Teviewing my notes and writing down this information is Gamn’s first hehocentric
example, It reads: April 16, 193] 10 March 19, [954 - Heliocentric Satum moved 287-
degrees & 15 mimes, which equals 17-degrees 13 minutes Capricom, Price 8632. This
seems very innocemt and obvious from our mathematical calculation procedure but E think
there is one more gem of Gano’s wisdom Indden in this tiny sentence! Here is my
discovery: If we look up the date April 16, 1934 in a heliocentric ephemeris, we will find
Saturn located at 17-degrees 18 minutes of Capricorn, which is equal 10 287.283-degrees

of the circle on the date ofa major low. From this date to the March 19, 1954 date,

heliocentric Satum moved this exact amount (287-degrees), which in my experience with
studying Gann is well beyond coincidence! Although I have not had ample time to
perform a study of this specific technique, ie., of relating a zodiac position to a future
time cycle. I have utilized a similar idea {that [ think Gano would be proud of) where J try
10 locate future sensitive degrees in the zodiac based on the Harmonic Mean and
Geometric mean of a single planets longinnde on the date of @ major high or tow price,
This works very well, which gives me great confidence in the discovery I just presented
because tbe points are ait related. To illustrate the concept 1 will provide an example:

. The Dow Jones Industrial Average made an important low on October 18, 1999.

* The heliocentric position of the planets are illustrated in the following horoscope:

Heliocentric Mercury is at 21 Capricom = 291.

Heliocemtric Mars is at 12 Aquarius = 312,
Now lets locate our sensitive degrees using the harmonics of the square & triangle.

21

To locate Mercury’s geometric mean points that are square (o 21 Capricorn we raise
our aspect by the power of 2 and divide by the October 18, 1999 position. So 90 “2 =
$100 divided by 291 = 27.83 (Aries). To convert the decimal to minutes multiply by 60.
Sixty times 0,83 = $0. So we have 27-degrees 50-minutes of Aries for the first square
location. This location was hit November 11, 1999. The next squace is
270 “2 = 72,900/291 = 250.51 or [O-degrees 31-minutes of Sagittarius. This location was
hit by Mercury on December 31,1999. Mars geometric mean square would be $100/312
= 25,96 or 25-degrees 57-min. of Aries, This point was hit on Friday, February 11, 2000
and the Market dumped 260 points setting in a major low that was 12% off tbe January
14° (Mercury) high. The market then reversed ias downtrend and advanced nearly 300
points on February 14° & 15". I will go into this subject again later in the material so
make sure you understand tbe math involved, Suffice it to say [ believe Gann was
showing this student a very valuable technique via an Astronomical Balancing of Price &
Time. I doult that anyone has ever noticed this before inctoding tbe recipient of this
unique ktter. It appears that a balancing of Zodiac Longitude was important to Gann. If
for example, the low in coffee occurred when Satum was at Il degrees of Libra ot 191 of

the circle, then a balancing point would occur 191 degrees into the future when Saturn

hits 22~degrees Aries.

The rest of this coffee letter is written clearly and im my opinion needs no further
exphmation. If you not understand the rest of the information, you should study some

basic astrology. Preferably, titles listed on Gann’s recommended reading list,

Forecasting Wits Cycles
Because the coffee letter ends with geocentric movements of Mars, it is

appropriate to discuss cycles, The reason for using planets as a measurement for tinting
potential changes in market trends is that they are natural occurying units of time. This is
not astrology! Many people will laugh at this concept and say that it is a ridiculous
theory. But these same people have no problem in accepting standard measurements of
time such as days, weeks, months, and years. This is why Gann did not talk or write
about astrology or planetary cycles even though it was his main forecasting tool IF we
examine the typical measurements of time, we will see that they are all based upon
planetary movement. 11 just so bappens 1o be the planet we live on.
A day or 24 hours ia simply the amount of time it takes the Earth to catate or spin 360
degrees on #’s axis. A week is based on the Lumar quarters, a month is the amount of
time it takes the Earth to move through a zodiac sign or 30-degrees which also completes
a 360-degree revolution of the Moon sound the Earth. And finally a year is the amount
of time it takes the Earth to complete an orbit around the Sun, Our entire concept of time
is based upon planetary movement. So why should it seem “weird” to use other naturally
occurring time measurements! Is it so far fetched to believe that cycles are actually
caused by planetary orbits? Even if the planets do not cause cycles the orbits still

represent a natural unit of lime that may have some universal harmony thal we are

.

24
unaware of. Whatever your personal beliefs are, the fact is that Gann used planetary
orbits to Lime market movements. In the appendix, you will find Gann’s Forecasting
course, which is simply tiled Forecasting. Gann produced two different forecasting
courses; this one is more rare than the other one titled Forecasting by Time Cycles,
which is typically found in Gann’s Master Courses for ether Stocks or Commodities. In
the course provided, Gann gives very specific ruks for figuring out when the next top or
bottom should be expected. It is important to know that he is not talking about the typical
calendar units of time. This should be evident 10 you by now based on the Coffee letter
alone. Since Gann’s rules for using these time cycles is clearly laid out in tbe course, [ am
bot going to discuss how to use these cycles. What I am going to do is define m my own
opinion the actual planetary measurements that Gann was really pointing the student
towards (to increase accuracy). All of these cycles are heliocentric orbits, not geocentric.
Because of the elliptical nature of planetary orbits and changing speeds due to perihelion
and apbelion, these important time periods do not typically equal the fixed units of time
that Gann wrote in the course, This is why you must kam how to use these planetary
cocks!

Great Cycle - 60 Years: This cyck is ibe Third conjunction of the two largest planets in
the solar system, Jupiter & Satum, A conjunction between the two massive planets takes
place every twenty years and is also Gann’s 20-year cycle. (The appendix has a chart
from Mas in Cosmos that illustrates the importance of conjunctions of Jupiter & Satum
on repeating patterns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Note: This chart centers the
calendars of the price charts with geocentric Jupiter conjunct the Sun. This time period is
alsa two compkete Satum orbits.

zs

$6-Vear Cycle: This cycle of 49 to 50 years (a period of “jubilee”) is related lo 210-
degrees of Uranus which moves 30 degrees in 7 years, Other potential cycles are 3 & 14
conjunctions of Jupiter & Uranus {every 14 years) or the geometric mean of Saturn &
Uranus, which is also equal to this time period. Gann also describes this as being 225° to

240° in the second circle of 360°, the period of being 586 months.

30-Year Cyete: This is the orbit of Saturn

20-Year Cy¢le: This is the conjunction of Jupiter & Satur. This period is also rds of

Satum’s orbit,

15-Year Cycle: This is 2 Satum’s orbit also conjunctions of Jupiter & Uranus (14 yrs.)

should be watched.

10-Year Cycle: % cycle of Jupiter / Saturn conjunctions. Also = 120-degrees of Satum’s

orbit.

F-Year Cycle: 30-degrees of Uranus & also % cycle of conjunctions with Jupiter &

Uranus,

3-Year Cycte: This is the secret of the Hexagon Chart, Each 5-year period is based on 60
degrees of Saturn completing all six sides of a cube or hexagorr It is also % of the Jupiter
Saturn conjunction cyck.

Minor Cyetes 3 & 6 Years: This is 90 & 180-degrees of Jupiter, respectively,

2-Year Cycle: One Mars Satu conjunction, one Mars orbit 1.88 years.

7-Month Cyche: One Venus arbit is 225 days

3-Month Cyck: One Mercury orbit (such as 10/18/99 — 1/14/00 Dow Jones Mercury
moved 360-degrees}. This is also 90 degrees of the Earth's orbit,

i-Momth Cycte: One lunar orbit around the Earth, 30-degrees if the Earth & 1-degree of
Satum

1- Week Cycle: 90-degrees of the Moon's orbit.

Gann goes om to say: “Stocks move in LO-yeac cycles, which are worked out in 5-year
cycles — a 5-year cycle up and a $-year cycle down. Begin with extreme tops and
extreme bottoms to figure all cycles, ether major or minor”. From here on he explains
his rules for adding specific time periods to tops and botioms. This is where you peed to
use the planetary periods above to calculate the future cuming point,

Pay close attention to Gann's instructions because he is specific about whether the future
date is supposed to be a top or bottom, Also, note that you may get conflicting cycles, ie.
one cycle may be forecasting a top and another a bottom. This is why Gann said: “Time
is more important than price”. Because when the time clement comes in you will be able
1o visually determine if the market is topping or bottoming from it's price action and

trend. Cycles are additive, so you must weigh the total number of topping cycles against

2

the total number of bottoming cycks to be completely accurate in forecasting a top or

bottom. This is really not important as far as the timing is concemed.

¢.37-Year k Market Cycle

Earlier im the material, ] discussed the importance of the 37-year cycle and the
mathematical relationship x has to Jupiter & Saturn the largest planets in our solar
(radiant energy) system. I also illustrated the cosmic harmony or cosmological key of 17
years as it relates to other planetary orbital periods, In its simplest form, you can add 37
years to any major high or low to estimate when major tums are due. For example, if you
add 37 years to the 1907 “Rich mans Panic” low, you get 1944 and adding 37 again, you
get 1981, The top in 1929 + 37 = 1966 and next would be 2003. These are just
estimations, ihe actual low in the cycle may vary by + or—a year so it is very important
that you understand planetary cycles as fimdamertal timekeepers. The 37-year cycle,
which equals two Lunar Node cyckes, is broken up imo three distinct phases:

« Phase 1: This is the very beginning of the 37-Year cycle. This phase lasts 18
years (Jup/Sat geometric mean) bottom to botiom or one complete cycle of the
North Node of the Moon. Ii typically consists of the classic Elliot. Wave up
patiem (5 waves to a lop) over a 14 year (60-degrees of Uranus, and also 360-
degrees of Jup/Um) time period. Followed by a 4 year (lwo Mars orbits or two
Mars Saturn conjunctions) “Bear Market”, completing phase one.

. Phase 2: Starting from the end of phase one, this phase lasts about 7-years bottom
to bottom and is the shortest phase in the 37-Year cycle, This phase reaches its
market peak 5-years (60-degrees of Saturn) from it’s starting point. This phase
calls for a 5-year “Bull” move, which consists of two up kegs (R.N.Euiott’s a-b-<
pattern) witb one intervening “Bear” market or narrow trading range market.
From this 5-year (Satum) high, a 2-year (Mars) Mars/Satum “Bear™ market or

sideways market begins completing 7-years total (Uranus 30-degrees).

. Phase 3: This és the final and usually most spectacular phase of the cycle. It
begins at the end of phase 2 and lasts a total of 12-years (Jupiler) low to low. The
average time span from this phase’s beginning to its uhimate high is about 8 years
(240-degree of Jupiter). From this major “1929 style peak, a 4-year (720-degrees
of Mars, 120-degrees of Jupiter, 2 Mars/Satum conjunctions) “Bear” market
begins, typically with a market crash. At tbe end of the 4-year period the 37-Year

cycke starts aB over again.

T will give you some highs and lows of cach phase in terms of typical calendar years. T
strongly urge you to calculate these time periods with the planets as outlined above. Only
then will you see and bebeve the value of planetary movements, At the time of this
writing, we ate in the 8 year “Bull” market of phase 3 which began after a sideways
“Bear” market pattem that lasted from January 29%, 1994 to March 10°, 1995. If this

cycle continues to hold, we should reach a 1929 style top near the year 2003. This time

period also correlates with the Uranus Square as described in Fowr-Dimensignat Stock

Market Structures & Cycles by Bradley F. Cowan. This point will be reached when
Heliocentric Uranus reaches O-degrees Pisces.

Please study these periods in terms of the actual highs and lows and planetary orbits.
For example the phase one low shown above as 1933 actually occurred Juty 8, 1932, the
phase evo low shown as 1988 above actually occurzed October 19%, 1987. I am
providing both charts in the appendix and historical data in Excel for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average from January 1,1900 io December 31,1999. This will allow you to
study the 37-Year cycle properly. The pure calendar year version of this cycle was
originally published by Larry Wiliams in bis book The Secret of Selecting Stocks For
Immediate & Substantiz! Gains «Windsor Books 1995). The astronotuical cotrelation's
and refining of this cyclical pattern is the author’s own work (Great job Larry!) and is
very usefidl in forecasting marke moves. My personal belief is that the year 2003 will
probably be a low and not a high. There are many interesting aumeric and astrological
cycles that support this view, The correlation between the Lunar North Node and
American Economic expansion indicates that the US economy will peak out when the
Lunar Node is in Leo trom September 17%, 1998 to April 4%, 2000. From here the
economy should really start to cool down. Satum enters Gemini on January 27" af the
year 2001, which has historically been bad for the United States economically.
Numerically, every major low from August of 1982 has followed a Fibonacci sequence n
years. 1982 +3 = 1985, 1982 + 5 = 1987, 1982 + 8 = 1990, 1982 +13 = 1995 and 1982
+2] = 2003. Cycks also indicate a Republican President thai is assassinated in office and
strong prospects of a major US military conflict near 2003. My advanced Square of 9

course goes into this subject in detail.

Important Formulas & T: ues for Working with Ptancta c

First, # is a necessity that you leam the zodiac signs, zodiac symbols & degree of the
circle, and the planetary symbols. Next you should memorize the time required for a
planet to complete an orbit around the Sun. You should also memorize the time period
required for conjunctions of the outer planets with each other, To illustrate the
importance of this lesson, I will provide a few simple examples.

At the Stock Market Low August 12, 1982 Saturn was at 23-Degrees Libra. Adding
180-degrees to this posifion gives 23-degrees Aries which was hit April 22, 1998 where
the vast majority of Stock Market Indexes topped before correcting over 20%. Also,
Jupiter was at 13-degrees 45’ Scorpio on August 32, 1982. Adding 540-degrees (360 +
180) yields 13-degrees 45° of Taurus, which will be hit on March 23, 2000.

The Asian Currency Panic occurred on October 22, 1997 with Mars at 18-degrees
Capricorn, Adding 180-degrees 10 Mars gives 18-degrees Cancer which was the Russian
Ourrency Panic August 31, 1998! This is Gann's |-year cycle that often shows a change

in trend in the 10" or 11% month.
Now we will book at an example with tbe relationship of two planets. The first thing

you must remember is that a pair of planets can never be more than 180-degrees apart.
Second, you must observe if the planets are getting closer together (applying) or getting

32
farther apart (separating). f will give an example of each; both will be updates from

Four-Dimeasional Stock Ma

At the Market top January 29, 1994 Saturn is @ 2.06’ Pisces and Urems is @ 22 28"
Capricorn. The angle between the two is 332.10 — 292.47 = 39.63 degrees or 39-degrees
37° minutes of separation. The planets are getting farther apart moving towards 180 or
opposition. Adding 4 degrees to this amounl of separation gives 69 37’ which was the
top of the S&P 500 index October 7”, 1997 just prior to the Asian Currency Panic.
Adding another 3)-degrees gives 99 37°, which will bit on January 28, 2001. The next
significant tum will come a 7% {¥% of 15) + 99 37° = 104 37° separation or 7/25/2001.
You can keep adding harmonics of }-degrees (15, ? 4, 3%) or harmonics of 45-degrees
(22 %, 11 V4, 5 5/8ths} to calculate future cycle turning dates. Once the numbet gets 1o
[80, you have to subtract because the planets are no anger separating; they are applying.
For example 90-degrees + 89 37° = 179 37°. [f we want to calculate the next 30-degree
cycle date we would do the following: 180-179 37° = 23’ minutes. This is the amoun of
movement left before the planets start applying. 30-degrees minus 23” minutes = 29 37°.
This is the amount we have to subtract from 180 (maximum separation) to calculate the
next angle relationship,

180 — 29 37" = 150 23°. This example shows the math required for both separating and
applying planet scenarios. Remember that there are only 60’ minutes in a degree. This
process is very similar to calculating time on a non-digital clock i.¢. the old fashion

second, minute and hour hands, [f you try to visualize the fast moving planets as the

second hand and the slower planets as the minute and hour hands, you will have a pretty -
good understanding of what is physically happening between the planets.

Arithmetit, G: ric & Harnmosit M inc Lougitud

According to Plata, the laws that govern the creation of all things are the very same -
laws, which allow for our comprehension. Therefore if the mean term is understood, then
90 is the entire series. For example: the geometric mean between any two terms (A and
C) is the square root of (A"C) the two terms multiplied tagether, The Harmonic mean is -
(A*C) divided by (%4 (A+C)) or the arithmetic mean, which is simply the average of any
two terms (A+B)/2. Earker, [ showed and illustration of geometric mean aspects of
zodiac longitude for the planets Mars & Mercury fiom the October 18 1999 low. Now ] -

will illustrate whet aspects are important and how to calculate them for future timing, The
most important aspects to calculate are the Squares & the Triangles (90,180,270) & (120,
240). Solving the above formulas for an unknown we get the foliowing: (L) Let X = the
desired aspect or angular relationship.

Qolving for grometric means We gel CK) aauared divided OY

where X is equal to the aspect you want to calculate (See the Mars & Mercury examples

presented earlier).

Solving Aarmomic means we get '4 (X) times previous zodiac pasition divided by the
previous zodiac position minus 4 (X}. Example: lets say we wank 40 find the Harmonic
opposition (180) to Mars on the Dow Jones Jow from October 18", 1999, Mars was
located at 12 Aquarius so the sohution is % (180)* (312 312- % (180)= 28080 / 222 =
126.49 or 6-degrese Leo 29° mimates, Looking this up in an ephemeris we pet: Monday,
August 28, 2000 for our market date.

Three Term Proportion of Plawctary Pairs

Moving on with this analysis technique we will look at the geometric & harmomc
Proportion of two planets. The formulas are based on the total distance traveled by the
planets you are using. ] typically only use Jupiter, Saturn, & Uranus because of their size
and mass, Also look at the Pythagorean formula for the bypotenuse of a right triangie.
Examples are:
Major Topa: September 3, 1929 to March 10, 1937. Uranus moved 30-degrees
(important all by itself} & Saturn moved $5.51. The Hypotenuse ™ Sqrt. (85.5142 + 302)
which equals 90.6 degrees or 90-degreees 36°minutes. Making this 1937 top square to the
September t929 market top.
Major Tops: September 3, 1929 10 August 13, 1937(2™ top in 1937 before a major
decline). Saturn moved 90-degrees 43’ (Square) Jupiter moved 231.63, Uranus moved
31.673. The geometric mean of Jupiter & Satum is Sqrt (90.73 * 231.63) = 144 (square
of 12). Remember that Jupiter’s orbit of 12 years divided by Saturn's 30 year orbit = 0.40
and that 360-degrees * 0.40 = 144 degrees. in tbe early 1920°s, Professor Weston
discovered that 18-degree harmonics of the Jupiter Satu synodic cycle correfated with

35

turning points in the New York Stock Exchange. 144 is part of the 18-degree cycle that
Professor Weston describes, The 18-degree aspects are the 20 harmonic of the circle
(360/20), which is also the number of years required for the two planets to conjom. The
cycle starts at zero and grows by 18 until the opposition at 180-degrees. The end of a L0-
year cycle. 0, 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180 , 162, 144, 126, 108, 90, 72, 54,
36, (8 and 0, The Market tends to peak at 18, 90, and 162-degree aspects, The Market
tends 10 trough or bottom on 54, 126, 180, and 0-degree aspects according to Professor
Weston’s research. Another market analyst and financial astrologer, Luther Jensen also
used Weston's Jupiter/Saturn cycle to forecast market moves.

A more recent example is: From the major bw August 7, 1982 10 the low October
18%, 1999, Satu moved 72.033 (% the square of )2) and Uranus moved 200. The
geometric mean is the Sqrt. (72.03 * 200) = 120 degrees or trine, This is a period of 17
Years (this important time period has been already discussed) where theee-tenm geometric
proportion is forming a trine (or triangle) with a previous major market low.

1 could go on with this technique but it is better for you to do {and discover} the work
yourself, Use dates of Major Bull Market Tops & Major Bear Market Bottoms. Next
calculate how many degrees Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have traveled. Then calculate the
geometric, harmonic and hypotenuse of the 3 combinations (Jup/Sat, Jup/Um, Sat/Urn).
if your answer is larger than 360, simply subtract this amount {reject the circle), Then
Jook for harmonics of squares & triangles. Also inchxle, the square of twelve (144) for
potential geometric harmony. ] have provided you with a few more examples of this
technique from my hand written notes in the back of this document.
Gann’s MOF CE Formals and Master Pattern Charts

Gann ends one of his grain letters to o private student with the following statement:
“Remember that you have signed an agreement not to reveal these rules and instructions
to any one, and by keeping these secret discoveries confidential for you own use, you will
later receive the very important CE Average, and the MOF Formula which is only taught
to students whe have taken the same course as you have and we do not reveal it to

students who take the minor courses and pay less money.”

These formulas are actually revealed in Gamm’s 1954 Coffee letter and his Soybean
Letter of the same year. The CE Average is the “Cycle of Bight” Average. Gann simply
takes the longitude average of the 8 planets that revolve around the sun both geocentric
and helioventric and reduces each to a single longitude.

The MOF formula is the “Mean of Five”, In this formula, Gann only uses the average
longitude of Jupker, Satum, Uranus, Neptune and Phito or the 5 outer planets with Mars
left out, He computes both the geocentric and beliocentric averages and uses the mean or
average longitude. Including Mars gives us the mean of six. Gann said: “The averages of
the six major planets Hehocentric and Geocentric are the most powerful points for Time
and Price resistance. Alsa the Geocentric and Heliocentric average of the five planets

with Mars left out, is of great importance and should be watched".

Gann used these averages to find support and resistance levels for stocks and

commodities. He used these averages of planetary longitude to determine if price was

37

making an astrological aspect (square, trine, conjunction, opposition, etc.) to the
fongitude averages. He also tooked at the position af each individual planet's geocentric
and heliocentric longitude to price, especially Jupiter and Saturn (also the midpoint
be1ween these two giant planets). Gam would also place the planets and averages on bis
“Master Charts” 10 get different numerical patterns from geometric shapes such as the
hexagon, square of 9, square of 4, and the circle chart,

As an example, Gano wrote in his Personal Soybean Letter, Dec. 2, 1953, May
Soybeans high 314%. This equaled §8 45° in Pisces, close square of 90 degrees of Jupiter,
135 degrees to Saturn and 180 degrees of the averages, and 120-degrees of Uranus. 300
price equals 30-degrees Virgo. 302 equals 30-degrees Libra. 304 equals 30-degrees
Scorpio”. These are obviously not straight longitude conversions of price because 31144
price in pure longitude would be 11-degrees 15° minutes Aquarius. However, on Gann’s
circle chart which is based on the Earth’s 24-hou rotation on it's axis $311'% is at 18 45°
Pisces. Just as an exercise, on the Square of 4, $311 would be about 20-degrees
Capricom, on the Square of 9, 3311 waukl be 0-degrees Gemini and on the Hexagon,
$311 would be 5-degrees Sagittarius. Gann used these shapes to relate price to zodiac
longitude. 1 have provided copies of all the above mentioned “Master Charts” for your
use and study.

Another purpose these charts served was for mathematical sequence. Gann had always
said that he based his cakulations on cycle theory and mathematical sequences (see pg.
75 of Tunnel Thru the Air). By creating these charts, Gann could look at periodic
numerical sequences or number cycles on these “Master Charts” to see if market turning

points had any mathematical relationship in Time or Price. Unlike ordinary cycles that

.

38

are fixed in terms of size or length, periodic number cycles have a geometric growth that
takes successively larger units of calendar time or price. Carl A. Futia wrote an
interesting report in June of 1982 on just this subject. The report was titled: Predicting
Marke) Trends with Periodic Numbet Cycles, The main reason for creating a periodic
number table Le. “Master Char?” is to see where the numbers come out in terms of natural
angles. For Exampk: [f you look at she Square of Nine, you can easily see that the center
of the chart starts at 1 and is surrounded by the eight numbers 2 through 9. If we divide
the 260-degrees of a circle by 8, we get 45-degrees. Therefore, the number 2 is on the 0-
degree angle (Aries), the munber 3 is on the 45-degree angle ($5 Taurus}, the number 4 is
on the 90-degree angle (Cancer), 5 is on the 135-degree angle (15 Gemini), 6 is on the
180-degree angle (Libra), 7 is on the 225-degree angle (15 Scorpio), 8 is on the 270-
degree angle (Capricom) and 9 is on the 315-degree angle (15 Aquarius). 10 is back at
the O-degree angle, and so on as you keep going around the square. The Square of 4 is
based on 90-degrees (360/4 = 90) per cycle. The Hexagon is based on 60-degree tums
(360/6 = 60). Finally, the circle chart is based upon 15-degree tums (360/24 © 15). Gann
said to use these charts for “Price, Tame, Space or volume”. The main reason for using
these charts is to see if time (market turnmg poaits) or price is consistently falling on the
same geomeiric progression, i.e. they are all on the same angle To give you some idea of
how you would use this information, I'll give you a few examples. First, lets set up some

simple tables based on the Square of 9.

Read the above chart horizontally, ie. the nurobers on the zero degree angle are 2, 11, 28,
53, ete. the 90-degree angle numbers are 4, 15, 34, 61, 96, etc. Now, there are several
ways to use these charts, One technique is to use tbe positions of the planets and the CE
Average, MOF Formula, ard the Mean of Six as discussed earlier to determine if there is
price resistance or support on the “Master Chart” due to Astrological aspects (Squares,
Trines, Conjunctions, Oppositions) Gann’s “outer circle”. 1 will illustrate this technique
when we analyze Gann’s Personal Soybean Letter. Another technique is to find the price
ofa Major Top or Major Bottom on the “Master Chart” and determine the angle that
the price fell upon and convert it to time. For example the major low for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, July 8°, 1932 was $41.70. Sf you look at the table above (or on the
square of 9 itself) you will see that the number 40 is on the 180-degree angle and 43 is on

the 225-degree angle. Since $41.70 is about half way between these two angles, and we

know that they are separated by 45-degrees then we can determine the actual angle that
this price hit. One half of 45 is 2214 and this amount added to 180-degrees = 202.5-
degrees {22 30° Libra). Looking at the Square of 9 we can see the other numbers that are
on this exact angle. 7, 21, 43, 73, 111, 157,etc. These numbers can represent hours, days,
weeks, months, years, or even planetary degrees traveled. If we look at the Macro scale
of Solar years we would get 1939 (7+1932), 1953 (214+1932), 1975 (43+1932), 2005
(73+ 1932), etc, However, ii is important to be exact. [f you study the Square of 9, you
will learn that it is a square root calculator. To determine the next number on an angle
you simple take the square root of the number (the Sqr. Root of 41.7 = 6.457) add two
(6.457 +2 =$.457) then square the number (8.457 squared = 71.53. To detérmine the
previous number you would have subtracted 2 from the root and Then Square the result.
Therefore, 41.7 years from July of 1932 would really be in the year 1974, which alsa had
8 Major market low similar to 932. 71.53 + July 1932 would yield the year 2003 again
as a potential low (Picase reread the 37-year cycle regarding this year & also Brad
Cowan's Uranus node at O-degrees Pisces hitting this same year). When converting price
10 time, it is an absolute necessity 10 have at least two confirmations on the same “Master
Chari" of time (your target dete) from differem Major Tops or Major Bottoms. It is not
my intention, nor was it Gann’s to do all the work for yout To truly learn and mastez
these techniques you must do the work yourself. [ am only trying 10 remove much of the
confusion that surrounds Gann’s writing style and techniques. Another example is ibe top
price of 386 September 3“, 1929. The square root of 386 is 19.646, This root number
minus 12, which is 6 cycles or numbers in towards the center on the same geometric

angle = 7.646, [f we squawe this number we get 58.47 years, 1929 + 58.47 = the year

4)

1987, which also had a 1929 style crash. Remember, you should examine other market
highs & lows in the same manor to find more than a single hit for your targe1 period. To
nerrow down your target date, you would use this same technique with smalks time
periods such as months, weeks and days, As you use smailer increments of time, the
significance of the tuming pomt can also be decreased. [n other words, the turning points
are defined as “major” based upon the time scale you are using. Major curning points on a
weekly chart might not even show up on a monthly or yearly chart, but they are important
when using weeks to narraw down your target date. The same logic is applicable to days
ot even hours, ie, the tuming point or swing should be a “Major” swing high or low
relative to the time period your chart covers. From this information, it should be obvious
to you that the square root of'a major high or low price creates or is in syne with a rhythm
in time. For example, on August 25%, 1987 the Dow topped at 2746 before the October
$7 crash, Converting this to a three digit number 274.6 and calculating the square root we
get 16.57. LE we add this period as years we get 1987 + 16.57 = 2003 again using ihe
same technique and calculator, You should also pay atiention to the mumber of days
(degrees of longitude) from the natal or first trade date (birth), or the number of days
from the most recent major low, For example: The birth of the U.S. Stock Market is May
17, 1792, The stock market top on September 3", 1929 is 50,146 days from 5/17/1792.

If you look at where this mumber fais on the square of nine chart you will see that it is on ‘

the 123° angle. The Market low on May 19*, 1947 is 56,613 days from the market birth
and is also on the 123° angle on the square of nine. The High on December 2", 1968 is
64,481 days from the market birth and is again on the 123° angle of the square of nine.
The sfiver panic and stock market low on March 27%, 1980 is 68,614 days from the birth

42
of the stock exchange and is again on the 123° of the square of nine! November 5°, 2000
3s also on the 123° angis.

Another technique using periodic sumbers is to simply take the time (or price}
difference between dates (or highs 10 lows, lows to highs) in terms of days, weeks,
months or years to determine if there is a sequence between successive luming dates,
Microsofl Excel is extremely useful for this task and also for the previous technique
meationed, | typically only use Weeks, Months, and Years. What you do is keep a list of
dates of previous market tums and simply add the periodic tise units that fal] on the
cardinal cross of the periodic chari (0, 90, 180, 270}. For example: lets lake two recent
lows in the stock market, Octaber 23,1997 and September 1, 1998, On the square of 9,
we would add the number series of 2, 11, 28, 53, 86, 127, 176, 233, 298 weeks for the
zero angle from each of these two dates io see if they had a common time period. Then
we would do the same thing for the 90-degree, 180-degree and 270-degree angles
(cerdinals only}. So we would run the series of 4, 15, 34, 61, 96, 139, 190, 249, 316
weeks, 6, 19, 40, 69, 106, 151, 204, 265, 334 weeks, and finally 8, 23, 46, 77, LE6, 163,
218, 281, 352 weeks from bezh lows and circle alll the time periods they have in common.
Then, we would do this same procedure with months and circk all the months they have
in common, These would be time periods that would require us to be on the kokout for
reversals of trend, Using weeks, the only common time periods are the week of February
20%, 1999 and May 25° 2012. Using months, the only common time periods are
September 1999, March 2060 (important planetary cycle date), March 2001 and August
2013, Remember from above, that there is a Jupiter cycle from the August 1982 low that

hit m March of 20001 NOTE: If you use the Hexagon chart, you will get a completely

43

different series of cardinal numbers. This also applies to the Square of 4 and the Circle
chart. Therefore, do not mix or combine forecasts from the Hexagon Chart with the
Square of 9 or the Circle with the Hexagon or the Square of 4 with the Square of 9 or any
other combination, Rule: Don’t mix apples and oranges! Your common turning date must
always come off the same “Master Calculator”, [ have found the Square of 9 and the

Hexagon Chart the most useful for this particular technique.

Another technique is to calculate price levels for support and resistance off of these
periodic mumber tables. The strongest support or resistance is abvays on the same or
opposite angle, The next in significance are the squares or 90-degree angles. For

example: November Beans recently made a low of $411, which is on the 180-degree
angie of the Square of 9. Therefore, all the numbers on this angle and the zero angle

(which is 180 + 180 =360 or back to zero) are important kevels for support and resistance.

These prices are:

334, 411, 496, 589 for the 180-angle and also 298, 371, 452, $41 for the zero angk. Just
simply locate your price on the “Master Chant” and find what angle it is on and look at all
the numbers that are on the same or opposite angle. For large aumbers like the Dow
Jones, simply move the decimal point and convert the price to a four-digit number.
Another technique that I’m still researching is to divide the price by the minimum
fluctuation 10 convert the price to ticks, For example, the 411 price we just boked at for
beans could also be $41 1/ 0.25 (or multiplied by 4) = 1644 and this number is on a
completely different angle. The first opposition to this number is 1726 divided by 4 =
$431. The first conjunction above 1644 is 1810 divided by 4 = $452.50. You may want to
experimen with this idea.

Earlier in the document, I mentioned that the Square of 9 was a square root
calculator. I gave an example based on the July 1932 low price of 41.70. To make sure
you fully understand this concept, we will go over some of the mathematical relationships
of the Square of 9. The Square of 9 is probably W.D, Gann’s most famous Master Chart.
Many traders use this chart regularly as a primary trading tooL However, i is my
personal belief that most traders are only using a few simpic techniques and are not fully
utilizing the true potential of this multidimensional Master Calculator.

What is the Square of
The Square of $ is basically a spiral of numbers starting wih the number one in the
center (or apex of the Great Pyraméd) with the number 2 immediately to the left. The resi
ofthe nurobers spiral around the center in a clockwise fashion 10 the number 9, which
completes the first cycle of numbers around the center. 10 through 25 completes the 2%

cycle, 26 through 49 compktes the 3", etc, The square is divided into eight 45-degree

a5

angies. On the next page I have provided a copy of the Square of 9. The numbers that run
through the center in the shape of a “+” sign are the cardinal numbers. The numbers that
run through the center in the shape of a “X” are the corner numbers. [n the first cycle
around the center, there is one digit separating each 45-degree angle. In cycle number two
{10 to 25) there are 2 digits separating cach 45-degree angle. In cycle three (26 to 49),
there are 3 digits separating each 45-degree angle. In cycle 1000, there wankd be 1000
digits or cells separating each 45-degree angle. This particular arrangement of mumbers
creates 4 Very unique square root relationship with other numbers on the chart. My
friend, Michael S. Jenkins illustrates some interesting square root trading techniques
utilizing the Fibonacci ratios and the square of 9 in bis Gann Course and his book Chart
Reading for Professional Traders. Basically, if you want lo move around the coordinates
on the Gann Wheel you take the number you are interested in (such as the all time High
or Low price) take the square root of the number, then add or subtract 2 from the root and
re-square the result. Example: Lets say that we are interested in the price 664 (which is
in the vertical cohumn straight up from the center), The square root is 25.768 +2 =
27.768/2 = 771 which is the number directly above 664 of one full 360 degree cycle out
from center. ]f we subtracted 2 from the root and ce~squared the number (25.768-2=
23.7682 = 565) we would get 565 which is directly below 664 or one full 360 degree
cycle in towards certer. Incorporating the Gann Emblem with this technique, allows us

to caleulate coordinates that are conjunct « (360 = +/- 2 from the root}, opposition ?(580
= +/- | from root #), trine (120= +/- .666) (240= 4/- 1.333), square D (90 = +/- 5) (270=
+4- 1.5) and sextile * (60 = +/- 333} (300 = +/- 1.666). This technique is extremely fast
and useful for finding coordinme squares of the Gann Wheel that are making bard

aspects to a previous position on the wheel. Also, Gann belicved that the numbers that
connected the square base of the pyramid (the 4 comers of the square, ie, comer #’s.) to
the “gravity center” and also the qumbers that ran straight vertical and horizontal from
the “gravity center” in the form ofa cross (cardinal numbers) were very important in
balancing “Price & Time” on the wheel. He was besically looking for astronomical
longitudes to balance with price on these key angles. Pythagoras said “ Units in a circle
of in a square are related 10 each other in terms of Price & Time at specific points.” Gann
often quoted the Bible, Emerson, Pythagoras and Faraday to name a few. Basically, he
‘was pointing the reader of bis works to clues that would allow his student to unlock the
code of his writing style. To quickly determine what cycle or ring a price is in, you
simply take the square root of the number add and subtract /%, then re-square them both
and subtract them from the original pumber. Example: What cycle or ring is the Dow
Jones trading in at the price high of 14,7502 Answer: the square root of 11,750 =
108.3974 +.25 = 108.6474, Re-squared = 11,804.26, Now take tbe original root 108.3974
and subtract “% and we get 108.1474 and this re-squared is 11,695.86. Now let’s take the
difference between these numbers. $1,804.26 ~ 11,750 = 54,26, 11,750 - 11,695.86 =
$4.14. Therefore, 11,750 is in cycle mumber 54 on the Square of 9. This is an important
technique when you use the square of 9 as a time cycle, which was discussed earlice
when [ showed that the 1929 top was on the 123-degree angle on the square of nine.
Time
Asound the outer perimetet of the square of 9 is a circle with months and days. The
circular caleedar starts on the right hand side of the wheel on the sare horizontal line as

the cemer block. The date is March 21” and refers to the start of the “natural” year in the

ay

season of spring with the Sun in Aries ‘Y’. “Lamb of God you take away the sins of the
world” (spring takes away the sins of winter). Starting at the 9 O'clock position, the
dates move around the circle clockwise completing the calendar. This simple
relationship allows the user to quickly identify dates that are Conjunct (365 days),
Opposite (182 days), Square (90 days), Trine (120 days) or Sextile (60 days) to a past

turning date relative to the Sun / Earth relationship.

Another price lechnique is to take all the cardinal and comer numbers and
amulliply them by the minimum fluctuation of the market you are trading. By doing this,
you can see what sumbers would appear on important angles of the square of nine if you
started with the minimum fluctuation and also grew the square by the same number. You
can also use the all time low price as the center and raultiple it by the cardinal and comer
numbers, For example: the July 1932 Dow Jones Low was 41.70, if we muktipty this by
281, a cardinal number, we get 11,717.70, which is very close to the extrems price high
of 11,750 teached on Jarwary 14° 2000, We can also put the extreme high in the center
snd subtract the cacdinal and corner multiples of extreme low of 41.70, For exampte: If
we take tbe cardinal number 53 and nmultiply it by the extreme low of 41.7, we get
2,210.10. If we subtract this amount from 11,750, we get 9,539.9 as a possible support
number if the Dow breaks 10,000, which ! believe will happen in March 2001, but we
will have to wai and see. Obviously, you can also add and subtact the cardinal and
cornet mumbers just as they are without multiplying them by an extreme low. By the way,
in all the quotes where Gann discusses a forecast he always says that it was based upon a
Master Time Factor. He always describes it a singular thing, which is probably a process.
The master time factor is not a particular cycle as many Gann students have been lead to
believe. For example, many have thought that the Master Time Factor was tbe 60-year
cycle, However, Gann said that one of his forecasts was based upon his discovery of the
Great Cycle, which is the 60-year cycle, and a Master Time Factot. This shows that they
are not one in the same. If you go through all the Gann material (Books, Courses and

Advertisements) you will find that the only other time he uses the words time factor is in

his Master Charts Course when he describes the Square of 9, In the Soybean ietter, Gann
says: “The square of *1' is | and ‘L” is the sun”, The only other place where Gamm puts
the number 1 in “1” is bis description of the Square of 9. In this same letter, Gann tells
the recipient to calculate the longitude average of the 8 planets that cevolve around the
gam. If “1” is the sun and ts surrounded by 8 planets (excluding Earth) then isn’t this is a
very similar description 10 the way Gann describes the Square of 971 will leave the rest

of this investigation alone.

Converting Lougitwde to Price.

The secret to converting zodiacal longitude into price levels is always based upon
the minimum fluctuation of the security, commodity, currency, etc. Many of today's
software pragrams use techniques that convert ibe current planetary longitudes into price
levels. For example if the planet Saturn is a 23° 21 Taurus, the straight longitude
conversion is $53.35 because Taurus starts at 4°of the zodiacal circle. W.D. Gann
illustzates this technique in tbe Coffee Letter. Diber techniques are based upon Gann’s
“Master Charts”. Specifically, the Square of 9, Square of 4, The Hexagon Chart, and the
Circle Chart. W.D. Gann gives an example of converting current planetary longitudes 10
price via a “Master Chari” in the Soybean etter. As an example, Gann wrote in his
Personal Sovbean Letter: Dec. 2, 1953, May Soybeans high 31144. This equaled 18 45° in
Pisces, close square of 90 degrees of Jupiter, 135 degrees to Saturn and 180 degrees of
the averages, and 120-degrees of Uranus. 304 price equals 30-degrees Virgo. 362 equals
W-degrees Libra. 304 equals 30-degrees Scorpio”. These are obviously not straight
longitude conversions of price because 31124 price in pure longitude would be | 1-degrees

45° minutes Aquarius. However, on Gann’s cirek chart which is based on the Earth's 24-
bour rotation on it’s axis $311% is at 18 45° Pisces, As shown in the eatlier exercise, on
the Square of 4, S311 would be about 20-degrees Capricorn, on the Square of 9, $311
would be O-degrees Gemini and on the Hexagon, $311 would be S-degrees Sagittarius.

Gann used these shapes 10 relate price to zodiac longitude.

Gann’s Master Egg Course has a hand written sheet of paper that he called the
“Table for Eggs”. The table starts at the lower left-hand comer at 0°00" Aries and moves
up through all 12 signs ending of course in Pisces. Gann takes the minimom fluctuation
of Eggs, which was 5 points and sets this amoum equal to one zodiac degree (Spxs. =
1°00”). Gann gives a quick relationship showing that 30° or one zodiac sign is equal to
150 points in Eggs. The whole circle is 1800 points because 5 times 360° = 1800, This
longitude relationship to the minioum ductuation is {as I have written about previously)
also the secret of Gann’s Angles. Knowing the minimum fluctuation allows you to create
astrological geometry (aspects) relationships to price. As a quick example, from the
above we know that 1800 points/cents is equal 10 360°
Therefore 1800 / 4 = 450 pts and is equal 1o 90° for the same reason that 360°/4 = 90°.
Therefore adding or subtracting 450 points from extreme highs or lows in Eggs will give
us our L* square aspect in price. The next 450 points (total 900} will give us the
opposition, the next 450 points or 1350 total will give the next square (270°) and finally
the next 450 points will give us the conjunction or 360°. Dividing 1800 by 3 = 600 points
and this will calculate the trmes or triangles, “Within the circle forms the square and the

triple, which prove the 4” dimension in working out price” W,D. Gann.

Another important technique is 10 use this same idea based upon natal astrology?
The four most important points of a natal horoscope are the Ascendant, Midheaven, Sun
longitude, Moon longitude. These are often referred to as the Significators by Separiel, an
astrologer on Gann’s reading list. For example, let"s say that a stock has an Ascendant of
13°23 Gemini. This longitude is equal to 73°23" of the circle, because Gemini starts at
60°of the zodiac. The minimum fluctuation of most stocks is 1/8, therefore 73.383°
multiplied by 1/8” or 0.125 = $9.57 in price, Taking 360° times 1/8" = $45. Therefore
$9.17 is conjunct or equal to 13°23’ Gemini and every $45.00 dollars above this price,
ako is equal io 13°23’ Gemini, ic. $54.17, $99.17, $144.17, etc, The other Significators
are calculated in this same fashion. The squares and tines to this Ascendant are
calculated as follows, $45.00 = 360°, $45/4 = $11.25 or 0° so every addition of $11.25
is square, opposile, square, then finally conjunct the Ascendant respectively, $45/3 = $15,
$0 every addition of $15 is trine, trine, then conjunct the Asc. Just to make sure ibat you
understand the conversions, if we were converting Soybeans, Corn or Wheat, which has a
minimum fluctuation of a % cent or 0.25 we would find that the Ascendant of 13°23’
Gemini is equal to 73.383 * 0.025 = $18,345. The squares are based upon 360°/4,
therefore 360°%.25 = 90. This means that 90 cemts is equal to 360°, 90° is therefore 1/4"
of 90 cents or 22.5 cents. Adding this value to the Ascendant value of $18.345 yields
40.845 as square, 63.345 as opposite, 35.845 as the next square, and 108.345 as conjunci
or once again equal to 13°23 Gemini. The trines or triangles are based on 1/3" of 90 of
3D-cent increments, etc. The student should also read and study Gann's definition of
“Active Amgles” in his Soybean Letter to fully utilize this astrological technique.

Gann’s Master Mathematical Formule For Market Predictions
Master Mathematical Price Tinse apd Tread Cakulator

In 1954, at the age of nearly 76, W.D. Gann released a coursé based upon
mathematical rules for making market predictions. In the advertisemen for this method
the author of the add writes: “We will not sell the course of instructions or teach the
mathematica) formmula for market predictions just to get money, which we do not need or
have to have; we will only sell the courses 10 people who meet our requirements, and if
we fel after a thorough investigation that a man or woman cannot make a success
investing or trading we will refuse to teach them the courses”. “The Master Calculator
can only be used with the Master Courses. It is not sold separate from the other courses”.
The price shown for Gann’s Master Course in this ad is $5,000.00, it does not list the
additional cost of the Master Mathematical Calculator. The ad describes the calculator as
a plastic overlay that accurately measures Time, Price and Trend. Many Gann experts and
students have tried 10 use these overlays, which require the chart to be hand drawn to a
proper scale on graph paper that has 8 squares to one inch. This creates a lot of extra
tedious work. This has caused one of Gann’s greates! discoveries to have been
overlooked for many years, I know that some software programs have the ability to make
these overlays on price charts but that is still not going to help most people because it
tuens out that there are also very precise mathematical rules regarding the horizontal axis
or Time! [n fact, these same mathematical rules apply to price as well but we will eave
this topic for latter. The advertisement itself contains clues about the calculator, such as
“W.D. Gann’s Record for 52 years”, “After fifty-two years of experience and research

53

SUPEEEPEE LEP EL EEE OED EE EEE E Pes

going back bundreds of years, I have proved to my entire satisfaction that history repeats

and that when we know the past, we can determine the future of prices”, The calculator
thet Gano is talking about in this ad is his square of 52 overlay, which is based upon the

52 weeks in a year. The basic overlay looks like that show above.

This is also tbe saene geometric form that Gann used for the Square of 90 and
Square of 144 plastic overlays. This basic structure or overlay appears in many books on
Sacred Geometry and is also the secret to George Bayer’s “Trend Determination” course.
Getting back to Gann and the square of 52 course we find that this is the course where
Gann made the confusing statement: “ Within the circ forme the square, there is an
inner circle and an inner square, as well as an outer square and an outer circle which

prove the Fourth Dimension in working out price movements”. This quote is describing &

fractal naturt or structural pattern existing in the markets that is the same on smaller

levels as it is at larger levels.

Jumping overt to Gann’s Angle course, on the last page, GA-32, Gann says:
“Figuring $100, ot per, as a basis for stock prices and changing these prices to degrees,
12% = 45-degrees, 25 = W-degrees, 374= 135-degrees, 50 = 180-degrees, 62% = 225-
degrees, 75 = 270-degress, 82% = 315-degrees, and 100 = 360”. This tiny litde paragraph
is the basis of the entire Murrey Math Trading Course, which readers of Traders World
should be very familiar with since, TH. Murrey has written numerous articles for the
magazine. These numbers are all natural 8* numbers off of the base of 10, 100, 1900,
10000, 100000, etc. The part that is most confusing is balancing this with the time
element, but based on the information given by Gann himself it should be obvious that he
has already shown us pari of the retationship. For example: if shares of XYZ stock
moved up 12% dollars in 45 days, weeks or 45 months then the stock is on tbe price
degree of #’s time angle, that is to say that price and time are equal or balanced. Gann's
example: “When a stock sells at 50 on the 180" day, week or month, it is on the degree of
its time angle”. “On February 1, 1915, U.S. Steel made s low at $38, which is closest to a
price of $374, which is 3/8" of 100 and equals 135-degree angle. Steel was 14 years or
168 months old on February 25, 1915, and hit the angle of 135-degrees, which showed
that the price of Steel was behind time, but was in a strong position, holding at $38 above
the (35-degree angle or the price $3714”, Just to make sure that you understaad this
information, U.S. Steel would have been balanced or “on the degree of its time angle” at
a price of $46 5/8™ because $10 360-degrees = 0.2777 7cents per degree and 168

5S

months mohiplied by 0.27777 = $46.67 which is closest to $46 ox 5/8* in ptice,
Therefore, Stee! is $8 5/8® behind time. F.H. Murrey has his time rules based off the
“Harvest Moon” but | would stick to W.D. Gann’s time definitions when using this
natural 8 system and his plastic overlays as his method has a clear degree relationship to
both price and time and also to the fractal structure, which he described in the quote
mentioned above. [ wilf discuss how to set up these charts properly in terms of time latter
in the article with specific examples. Gar goes on to say: “When Steel reached $200, it
equaled 2 circles of 360-degrees {two complete cycles of $100). When it advanced io
$261%, it was closest to $62 (5/8®) in the third cycle of $100 or neares! the 225-degree
angle or 5/8" poi, which is the strongest angle afler ® crossed the half-way point at
$250 or the 180-degree angle”. Note that Gann rejects the two cireks or cycles of $100
price to convert the time angle. These instructions are also very different than what

Murrey Math instructs students to do but [ do not want to get into that subject,

Moving on to the subject of time we know that Gann placed great emphasis on the
cardinal points of the solar year. These are the Vernal Equinox, Summer Solstice,
Autumnal Equinox and Winter Solstice or March 21%, June 217, September 21%, and
December 21" respectively. Gann always said that the year begins at March 21* (not
Jaruary 1°) and that this was a very important seasonal time. Now this is where Gann’s
“within the circle forms the square" quote gets real interesting! If we treat each natural
year (March 21% to March 21") as a complete cele, which it is because the earth has
gone 360-degrees around the Sun, and take W.D. Gann at his word that there is a square

within this orbit then we come up with some very unique geometrical information about
time and squares, i.e. Gann’s plastic overlays. Lets build a hypothetical square running
from Vernal Equinox to Vernal Equinox as our horizontal axis and we will use 0 10 100
as our vertical. Lf we draw in the two 45-degree Angles comer to comer we have a shape
that tooks like a box with an x int, The two 45°s will meet at the exact center of both
price and time al $50 on the Autumnal Equinox or September 21%. If we bisect this
square again with a horizonta! fine going left to right al $50, and a vertical line going
straight up from the Autumn Equinox we can create four smaller squares with balf of the
x already completed. If we complete these smaller boxes with the missing 45-degree line
we will find that these pois come ont at $25 and $75 in price and also 25% and 75% in
tame or Summer Solstice to Winter Solstice (June 21* to Decenaber 21"). [f we take these
4 points, which are $25 on June 21%, $75 on June 21°, $25 on December 21* and $75 on
Decembers 21" and make a new square, we find that our new square is exactly half the
size of our former squere set within the % points in temns of both price and time. Our new
square also maintains the exact center of our old square at $50, This new square is now
an exact musical octave of the ald square because it’s based upon powers of 2 of is
exactly 4 our od square. This tells us that if we want to find a square that is within our
old square that we will only find i1 between the two Solstice points in the yeart If we
wanted to enlarge the original square (1¢ find on outer square) we would again follow the
natural law of the musical octave, i.¢. powers of 2. The first part of the problem is easy
because we know that the next square is going to be twice as large as our old square. So
(las means that we are moving up from a one-year square to a two-year square in terms of
time but this does not answer where in lime this new square begins and ends. To calculate

where this targer square begins and ends we have to use the nile “as above so below”. In

$7
other words, when we made tbe smaller square, we found that it existed within the larger
square at the 25% and 75% points in time, therefore March 217 to March 21" is within
the % poimts of the larger square above x. In our one-year square, a % of time is 90-
degrees or 91.3125 solar days, This means that 4 % of time in the next larger square is
180-degrees or 182.625 solar days, ie. twice es big. If we add and subtract 180-
degrees/days from our smaller square running March to March, we will find that our two-
year square begins and ends at ihe Autumnal Equinox. The same is rrue for a 4-year, 8-
year, 16-year square, ctc. Getting back to the mner squares, a X-degree square {1/2 of
our 180-degree Summer Solstice to Winter Solstice and winter back to summer circle)
would begin and end 45-degrees after the Summer Solstice and 45—degrees before the
Winter Solstice because 45 is % of £80, This would be 45.65 days or % of 182.625. So
this means we would have another (90-degree) square running inside the (180-degree)
Solstice squares beginning on August 5 and ending November 5". Then just as we have
two 180-degree Solstice squares running from Summer to Winter, then Winter back to
Summer, we aiso have four 90-degree squares running from August 5® to Novembet 5°,
November $* to February 5", February 5° to May 5“ and May 5” back to August 5®.
These are all exact roathematical points to look for squares based upon Gann’s plastic
overlay pattern. ] am providing two charts of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (closing

* Within the circle forms the square, there is an inner circle and an inner square, as well
a8 an Outer square and an outer citcke which prove the Fourth Dimension in working out

Price movements”, Please note that the inner square is an exact musical octave of the

larger outer square.

This next paragraph was wot iaclnded in the published artic:

The seceet to these charts is to (1) use Gann’s base ten systern (or Murrey Math) for the
vertical price axis, (2) use all the angles presented on his clear plastic geometric overlay
chart, i.e. the square of 52 or the square of 144, (3) construct the squares horizontal axis
within the natural time periods as mentioned in this article and also within the base 10
system. Note: you will not find these squares unless you use the natural matbematical
time periods! Also note that the rules for increasing or decreasing the size of the square
on the peice axis are the same es those needed for the time axis. in other words, the top
and bottom price of each square are the 75%(6/8ths} and 25%(2/8ths respectively) lines
of the larger square above itself, Each larger square is exactly 2 limes as large as the
previous square but are always within each successive larger square on the quarter points
of both time and price! This is similar lo those Russian dolls that you keep opening and

finding smaller versions of the same doll inside each of the preceding larger dolb.
Gann's Mass Pressure C
've never pubtished this!)

Bach year, W.D. Gann would draw up a stick figure forecast of the stock market
averages and various commodity firtures in his Supply & Dequand newsletter service. He
would provide commentary tha would provide an outline of what he expected the market
to do. Gann said that the future was just a repetition of the past and one needed only the
Tight beginning to peedict the future. In latter years, Gann provided something he called
the Mass Pressure Chart. In his advertisement for his Master Mathematical Time Price
and Tread Calculator, Gann said that be would provide a Mass Pressure Chart for the
upcoming year, Based upon is vague description, the Mass Pressure Chart is supposed
1o indicate bullish and bearish trends according 10 Gann’s Master Time Factor, I have
talked to many Gann experts about the Mass Pressure Chari and most have no clue as to
what it may be, I have never seen an actual original Mass Pressure Chart from W.D.
Gann and I do not know of anyone else who has come across one. I have heaed rumors
and opinions thet the Mass Pressure Chast is simply a composite of the Market 20 years
ago end 60 years ago. Others have told me that it is actually the Market 80 years ago. In
terms of cycks, 80 years would have Mercury and the Sun at approximately the same
iongivude on the same calendar day. This is also one of George Bayer’s rules for
forecasting. The 60-year and 20-year cycles deal with the two largest planets in our solar
system, Jupiter and Saturn, which conjoin every 20 years. The 3" conjunction every 60-
years typically takes place in the same zodiac sign. [In Gann’s Forecasting course, he says
that the “previous 10-year cycle and 20-year cycle have the most effect in the fixture”.
Gann also calls the 60-year cycle the “Master Time Period” and “the Great Cycle” in this

él
particular course. Gann iatier says thai he could not have forecast the great advance in
1929 and determine when it would culminate without the 60 and 20 year cycles. In the
next paragraph, Gann talks about the forecast for 1935 and he is looking at every 20-year
period starting 80 years back, i.e. 1855, 1875, 1895 and 1915. As you go through his
forecasts and comparisons of past years, you will find that he consistently leaves out the
most recent 10-year cycle. L found this strange since he said that the previous 1-year and
20-year cycles had the most effect on the future. Another interesting point is that he
consistently looks back 80-years but does not talk about an 80-year cycle in the beginning
of the course where be is outlining the various Major cycles that you should be aware of.
I do not know for certain exactly what the Mass Pressure chart is. Allbough I bave my
own version, and have been able to duplicate many of Gann’s forecast charts; I bave
never seen an actual Mass Pressure Chart. My personal belief is that it is a composite of
the last 10, 20, 60 and 80-year cycles. As an example, when 1 made a forecast for the year
1997, E hooked at the years 1987, 1977, £937 and 19¢7. 1 made notes of when the major
highs and lows came out in these years and then went on to make a composite of all these
years as a singe chart. This chart below is what you get. By the way, do not expect these
forecasts to be accurate in terms of ampktude. In other words, they forecast trends and
extremes but not the magnitude of the next trend.

Looking at the above composite chart we get the following forecast: The market is bullish
and sitong up until March 12, 199? from here the Dow Jones Industrial Stock Average
drops until at least carly May with the potential for a double bottom on May 3i*
presenting secondary buying oppotiuntties. The market then has a strong advance imo the
first or second week in August where the Majority of stocks should top out for the year.
This is where stocks should be sold out to keep the profits acoumulsied during the
preceding advance. The market is bearish and weak into October with a potential short~
term top around October 7 to 10. From October 10” 10 October 25* bearish cycles
accelerate and the potential for a panic type break is indicated between October 21" and
October 25th. From bere @ strong bounce back is indicated for the 26" followed by
another drop to test lows before November 1°. The market remains pretty volatile until at
least December 3 where the potential to purchase stocks again at more attractive prices
for Christmas rally is likely. The safest buying point looks like December 21%, 22"

when a seasonal change is indicated, i.¢. the winter solstice.

This is what actually happened:

The market first topped on March 12" as indicated in the composite chart. The bearish
forecast into early May only lasted until mid April before stocks regained a bullish up-
trend. This tells us that the market is stronger or more bullish than the composite. The
High for the year came on August 6" before bearish cycles started to weigh on the
market, which lines up with the forecast. There was also a second high on October 10
and a panic type break on October 22™, The market had the strong bounce back as
forecast but never tested the panic lows again. Volatility lasted until November 22nd
around Thanksgiving when the up-trend accelerated. The market did sell off again

providing the buying opportunity indicated for the winter solstice on December 21°, 22"
Overall, the forecast predicted the general mood of the market with uncanny accuracy,
Even though the forecast chart docs not match the actual chart swing for swing the main
trends are definitely there. This is my version of the Mass Pressure Chart based upon the
information Gann provided in his Master Forecasting Course. 1 think you will agree that
it is a very useful technique. If you combine this type of chart with the actual planetary
cyckes, you get some fabulous results and remarkable predictions! By the way, these
charts can easily be made 10 years in advance. This same type of chart appears to be the
technique Gann used to forecast the 1929 Bull Market and Crash. Creating a composite
chart of the years 1849+1869+1909 yields a chart chat matches up with both Gann’s
forecast and ihe instructions he discussed in his forecasting course. The chart looks as

follows:
LPP LEPBPE ELIS OREPEEPEP IPOS

Note that the lows indicated for the end of March and Final top for the end of
August followed by a panicky break in the fall of the year are all shown on this
chart! This compares very well with what actually happened. You can get an actual
copy of Gann’s Supply & Demand Letter for 1929 online. The site is

www, webtrading.com/gannforecast.hun. My forecast chart lacks some of the details that

Gann’s contained because I only had monthly data for the year 1869 as opposed to the

daily data,

1997 was a fairly easy year to forecast. We were already in a Bull Market and it
was a pretty safe bet that we would repeat primarily like the Bull markets of 1987 and
1937. The fact that the market recovered so well after the Asian currency panic is another

indication that the bull market will continue in 1998. Gann’s basic rules for ascertaining

66
the type of year the stock market will have on page F-6 of his “Forecasting” course say's
that years ending in 8 are typically bull market years. This is another supporting factor for
a bullish 1998 forecast. Gann also says in this same course, rute #1 — “A bull campaign
generally nuns 5 years - 2 years up, 1 year down, and 2 years up, completing a 5-year
cycle”. This cyck is related to 60°-longitude movement of the planet Satur. It is also %
of the conjunction cycle of Jupiter with Satumn. PoDowing this basic 2-1-2 chythm from
the August 1982 low, we would expect 1982 10 84 up 2yrs, 1984 to 85 down Lyr, 1985 to
87 up 2yts, 1987 to 1988 down Lyr, 1988 to 1990 up Zyra, 1990 to GE down Lyr, 1991 to
1993 up 2yrs, 1993 to 1994 down lyr, 1994 to 1996 up 2yrs, 1996 to 1997 down lyr,
1997 to 1999 up 2yrs, and 1999 to 2000 down Lyr, There are other cycles in play, tut the
market has followed this general outline very well, The reason I’m going through all of
this is because you need lo know where you are currently located according to time
cycles, For example: Saturn will compkte its 3“ 5-year cycle of 60° on 4/22/98 at
23°40’ Aries. This is 180° from August of 1982 or one half of Satum’s orbit indicating
that we should have a high around this date. The Asian panic occurred on the 22™ of
October 1997 when beliocentric Mars was a1 18° Capricom. Gann say’s that “the
smallest cycle is one year, which often shows a change in the 16% or 11" month”. This is
180° of Mars’s heliocentric movement, which means that our next major turn will be
August 31° or September 1* 1998 when Mars hits 18° Cancer, I know this should be
tow becanse both Satum and Mars have hexagonal cycles that create the appearance of
polarity shifis in their 60° movements, This is because they botb actually have two
overlapping cycles of 120° that cause market tums every 60°, creating a bexagon ot “Star

of David”, Because this cycle is 1/3 of the circle (an odd number), you get cycles that

67
can genesate two or three consecutive highs or lows before reversing trend instead of the
anticipated saw tooth alternation from high 10 low that most cycle analysts look for. This
is also why the 60° Saturn cycle went low {-) to low (-) from 1982 te 1987 and then went
to a high (+) m 1993 and will likely go to another bigh (+) in 1998, which has beea a big
help for the bull market. From this information alone, ] would expect a major high for
stocks on 4/22/98 and a major low on 9/1/98. This will be one of the larget corrections in
this dull market because of a harmony with other cycks. If you create a decenial a.k.a.
10-year pattern chart ot a Mass Pressure Chart as illustrated eartier in the article, you will
see that they will not indicate this strong down move. What is actually happening is that
Mars will move a 120° from the Sow on £0/22/97 to a high on 5/698. This will complete
a Mars’ low fo bigh move. Mars will be negative for the next 60° into 9/1/98 and Satum
will also be negative from 4/22/98 because this date is 120° from the Sarum low 1988,
completing a low to high swing. Mercury shauld add to the down pressure after 8/5/98
when it passes 21 Capricorn, Venus wii add to the negative pressure after 7/7/98 and will
bottom on 91/98 with Mars, after moving 90° from 0° Taurus to 0° Leo, Mercury will
also be 120° from 8/5/98 on 9/3/98 supporting the upward energy for a strong bounce.
Both Venus and Mars start an up-move hear but there are also other larger cycles in play
that support an up-move from 9/1/98 but I will kave these for you to discover. There is 4
chart on the following page with the cycles illustrated, The following is another article
that I never published pertaining {0 forecasting with planetary cycles. By the way, Setum
will be down for 5-years, which indicates the year 2003 again.

W.D. Gaua’s Secrets to Forecasting:

Today thete are 90 many “Gann Experts” that are cashing in on the mysterious
methods of W.D. Gann. There are tons of books, several courses, computer programs,
trading systems or metbods, etc. that lure in the trading public, especially commodities
traders 10 spend their hard earned money in the hopes of discovering the true “Holy
Grait" techniques of Mr, Gann. I have personally spent countless sums of money over
the15 years or more of personal study, in the pursuit of Gann’s methods. I really have no
idea what the total final bill amounts to but E can easily recall how much of it was a value
and how much of it wes complete junk. E won't slam anyone ot poin the finger at authors
of material that is of little value. What 3 am willing to do is share my merpretation of
Gann's work with the public in the form ofa book, I never planned on writing a book.
Bw after all of the letters 1 received from the two previous articles that I wrote for
Traders World requesting that ] offer more information, I decided to put some

information together that would be truly valuable to the “Holy Grail” seeker. To prove
Toy spcetity, and also the value of this work, I will provide you with extremety valuable
information in this article on Forecasting.

The main attraction with Gann is forecasting! The idea that the future can be
predetermined is a fascinating concept. To truly understand Gann's methods, you must
understand his concept of time. Gann said that “Time Proves All Things” and that “Every
moveroent in the market 3s the result of a natural law and a cause which exists ag
before the effect takes place and can be determined years in advance. The future is but a

Tepetition of the past, as the Bible plainly states.”

“The thing that bath been, # is that which shall be; and that which is done is that

which shall be done, art there is no new things under the sun.” Eccl 1:9,

Gann’s Forecasting Course deals with the use of “Major Time Cycles”. Gann betieved
that everything moves in cycles (circles) as a result of the natural Law of action and
reaction, He has said “ By a study of ibe past, I have discovered what cycles repeat in the
future.” The problem that most students of Gann run into is that they gel caught up in
trying to predict price. Gann always said that between the two, Time was much more
important than price. Knowing when to trade is the key to Gatin. [ will now provide you
with a short term and a long-term example based upon the instructions: “Rules For Future

Cycles” by W.D. Gann:

Ruk #4 “Adding 10 years to any top, will give you the top of the next 10-year cycle,

repeating the same kind of year and about the same average Muctuations”

To really understand what Gann meant by this rule, you have to understand his concept of
tame or what he means by cause and effect. Gann was a master mathematician, Mason,
and also an Astrologer! In fact, most of Gann’s recommended reading list deals with

Astrology. Now, lets look al what 10 years means to Gano.

Primarily, 10 years is equal to %4 of s Jupiter & Satuen cycle. Secondly, 10 years is equal
10 120-degrees of Satur or Two sides of the cube or his Hexagon chart.

At the market top of August 25", 1987, you will find that heliocentric Satum has a
Songitude of 20-degrees 12° mimutes Sagittarius and that heliocentric Jupiter's longitude
is 19-degrees 44° minutes of Aries. The angle between these two planets is 119-degrees
32° minutes and they are separating. If we add 120-degrees to Saturn (two five-year sides
of the Hexagon), we get 20-degrees 12° minutes Aries, which occurred on January 13%,
1998, If we use the angle between Jupiter & Saturn, then we must find out when these
two planets are 60-<degrees apart before tbe conjunction ic. 180-degrees minus 119 32” =
60-degrees 28° minutes, This occurred around July 16 1997, if you followed this cycle
as it was presented in Bradley Cowan’s Book Four-Dipgeasional Stock Market
Structures amd Cycles you would have been Jooking for an angle of S&-degrees, which
happened on August 6", 1997. Brad’s cycle wotk is an excellent resource for

understanding Gann's Forecasting course. This example illustrates the Top-to-Top

wi

relationship that Gann presented as ruse #4 in his forecasting course. Both dates were

Forecasting Monthly Movea
A short-term example or forecasting rule is: “Add three months to an important bottom,
then add 4, making 7, to get minor bottoms and reaction points.”

Again, we have to decode Gann’s definition of time. Three months is 360-degrees
of Mercury. Adding 4, making 7 months is 360-degrees of Venus. If you examine the
recent low of Gctober 18", 1999, you will find heliocentric Mercury at 21-degrees
Capricom and Venus is at 1-degree 26° minutes if Gemini. Looking in an ephemeris, we
will find Mercury again at 21-Capricom on January 14", 2000 (tbe exact top of the Dow
Jones before a 15% + correction). And Yenus retums to 1-26" Gemini on Tvesday, May
30* 2000 for another potential turning point. At the time of this writing, March 15* 2000,
the Venus forecast is yet to be fulfilled so watch the market around this day! I bope that

thas information proves to be valuable in your quest for knowledge, as this will be my lasi

.

article. One final parting piece of wisdom is that when you think of cycles, think of
throwing a stone into a pond of water. Each turning point in the market starts a ripple
effect thal moves forward in lime and effects the future. The moore significant the tuming
point, the larger the tippies. Just ke throwing in a small pebbte and a large rock. It is
obvious that the large tock will overpower tbe ripples of the small pebble, making its
effects non-distinguishable at times. In these instances, record the position of the minor
cycles at the time of the “Major” Tum and project these values into the future, along with
the old values to sec if the minor cycle has remained unchanged or has synchronized
itself with the larger cycles “Wheels Within Wheels”, This is why Gann said to work all
cycks from Major tops and Bottoms in the market.

Also pay attention to April 12, 2000 and July 7, 2000, when Mercury hits 21-

now see what happened.

Gann’s Permanent Charts

In Gann's Master Course for Stocks, in ibe Master Charts section, he has 1 Name
Chart for United States Steel. Gann says: "The name United States Steel, contains 17
leiters. Therefore, 10 make up # Pemranent Square for United States Steel according to its
name, will require 17 x 17, or a square of 289, Therefore, 17, which is really 2 1/2 times

the Jowest price at which Steel ever sold is an important point.

The prices 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, ace all
important vibrations on the name and angles of U.S. Steel.

The basic number or low point, for example 9, the lowest digit on U.S. Steel, and its
vibrations according to its name, all cause slight variations at times from other stocks,
because each stock works according io its own base, begiming point, nambers and name.

“US, Steel works good to the natucal angles and Master Chart (square of 9}, because its
digit is ¢ and comes out on exact 9 vibrations all the way through, finishing at 261, which
was 28 nines from its deginning point, or lowest level." The lowest price that U.S. Steel
traded was $ 3/8 28 x 9=252 and 252 + 8.375 = 260.375 or 28 nines from the low.
Therefore, tbe permanent charts are geometric squares based on the total number of
letters contained in the name. For example, Gann’s permanent chart for the NYSE is a
square of 20 x 20 containing 400 celts. This is because the Name: New York Stock

74

Exchange contains a total of 20 letters. Gann says that this chact can be used 10 measure
days, weeks, months, or years 10 determine when (ops and bottoms will be made against
strong angles, as indicated on this Permanent chéut.”

"For example: ~ The New York Stock Exchange was incorporated May 17th, 1792.
Therefore, we begin at "0" on May 17th, 1792. 1793 ends on a 1, when the NYSE was 1
year old. 1812 (Wac) will come aut on 20 which is at the top of the square indicating

resistance ot change;
1832 on 40 1892 on 100
1852 on 6 1912 on 120
1872 on 80 1932 on 140

Note that 139, ot 1931, strikes the 45~degree angle (on the Pecmanert Chart), running
from 26 dawn, and that this is ibe 7th zone; or the 7th space over, which indicates that
1931 is the ending of a bear campaign, and tbe starting of a bull market. But we must
watch for a break around May (Birthday) and June, 1931, when this angie is hit at the end
of the 139th year." In the fast page of this Permanent Chari section, Gann says that “The
more you study these Permanent Charts, the more you will appreciate their great value,
 finture, and that geometrical

angies and mathematical points measure every Resistance Level, Time, Price, Space or
Volume,”

My interpretation of this unique esoteric information is as follows: The number of
letters in the name defines tbe permanem chart, which is used to primarily measure time.
This coming May 2000 is 208 years from "0" On the NYSE permanent chart. This
number shows nothing significant in time resistance if you look at the angles on the chart.
The Years 2002 and 2003 {210 & 211 on the chart) show strong resistance as these years
are on 45-degree angles and also the midpoint or "gravity center” of the NYSE
Permanent Chart! It seems tbat the year 2003 just keeps raising xs head doesn’t it?

208 x 12 = 2496 months from May 17th, 1792. [f we reject the squares of 20, or 400 we
get the number 96 which is just above the 45-degree angie in section 5 of the permanent
chart. Note ihat the murober 95 {or one-month price) is right on # resistance angle
indicating that there is resistance in time for Apcil 2000, Also, the months September and
October come out on 100 (1op of square section 5\& 101 (bottom of square section 6)

which indicate changes as both are on 45-degree lines.

Also note that Gann sets the price vibration based on abe lowes! price traded. He also
uses this number in time when you read squaring price by time in his angle course, The
lowest Price on US. Steel was 8 3/8ths on May 14, 1904, which has nothing to do with
the number 9, So why does Gann say that 9:“The basic number or low point, for example
9, the lowest digit on U.S. Stee}, and its vibrations according to its name, all cause slight
variations at times from other stocks, because cach stock works according ta Hs own

base, beginning point, numbers and name?” I think tbat I have found the answer!

if we beeak down the name according to the rules of Numerology we get the foDowing:

L 2.3 4S § Z $ 9

J « M N oO Q oR

UNITED STATES STEEL

359254 121251 12553

Looking at this mumber breakdown of the name we find that all the mumbers m the
fame repeat at least once except for the numbers 4 and 9. The number 5 repeats the most

then #2. f believe the reason tbat Gano says that 9 is the lowest digit according 10 its

numbers and name is that the #9 is symbolically the beginning and the end because any
number added by 9 reduces mumericaily tack to the original number.

BO LTR I+F BR 1749-26 = 2468

949" 18 & 148 =—9 —:18+9=27 = 2+7"9

This can be carried on to infinity and the resuks will never change. [f we apply this
sare logic to the concept of zero as the beginning point, then we tind that 9+0 = 9.
Therefore nine is both the largest digit and senallest digit or the Alpha and Omega
simultaneously because adding 9 to any number mast reduce back into the original
umber! If you read the Setters in cohume 9 you get I R or the statement: “I ARE” which
is similar 10 the Biblical statement I AM that ] AM as GOD’s response to what his name
is. Therefore, in terms of a cycie yields the statement “I AM that 1 AM, [ ARE”. This is
very interesting in terms of the above concept of adding 9 to a number and reducing it
back ito the original number through addition.
1 believe that because the numbers 4 & 9 have no repeats in the name United States
Steel, and that the #9 is a similar concept to the Ace in a deck of cards (i.c. largest and
smallest) that this is why it is the “vibration” number for U.S. Steel ie. it has the fowest

frequency in terms of both repeats and also mumeric value in an esoteric sense,

If we do this same analysis with the New York Stock Exchange, we get the following:

Here agaim we find that all numbers in the name repeat at least once except ibe mumber $
just like U.S Steel. Therefore, the number 9 must also be the fundamental vibration for
the NYSE as well.

Gann also uses the name America (square of 7} as a permanent chart beginning
October 1492 when Cohumbus discovered America (1459931), which has the mumber 3,
as tbe fundamental vibration because 1 only occurs once a6 the name and is the lowest

value that does not repeat. The Name United States of America begins July 4", 1776 with

the signing of the Declaration of Independence, This is a square of 2]-letters which is 3
times 7 of the Ketter value of America, It is an interesting coincidence that the new name
is exactly the fundamental vibration of America (3) multiptied by its letter value (7} =
United States of America! (359254 121251 66 1459931) if you coum the repeats and
examine the values, you will find that the umber three still has the fewest repeals and is
also the lowest numeric value of the numbers tht repeat twice. Which means that 3 is

still the fundamental vibration ofthe USA. By the way, the year 2003 also comes out on

this name square in time as well. Try * yourself!

T have inchided copies of Gann’s Master Charts course and also Gann’s
Mathematical Price Tine & Trend Calculators course (The Square of 12 & The Square of
52). The square of 12 works best on the monthly chart because there are 12 monihs in a
year. The squace of $2 is used to measure weekly charts, a there are 52 weeks in a year.
Again these calculators are primarily designed for time but Gann says that you can use
them for price, ¥ohume and pitch. The square of 90 is based on the number of days
between equinox and solstice points on a calendar, ie. the cardinal cross-locations in the
zodiac. Gann also used 9 chart called the Square of the Circle, which is 19 x 19 = 361 or
L over a perfect 360. The gravity center of this number chart is 180, which proves the
square of abe circle. I believe Gann used this chart from Vernal Equinox 10 Vernal
Equinox, it. Match 21 to March 21” = 360-degrees of longicude. On the last page of
Gann’s Geometric Angle course, page. GA-32, Gann says: “Figuring $100, of par, as @
basis for stock prices and changing these prices to degrees, 1214 = 45-degrees, 25 = 90-
degrees, 374 135-degrees, 50 = 180-degrees, 62% = 225-degrees, 75 = 270-degrees,
82% = 315-degrees, and 100 = 360". As previously mentioned, this little paragraph is the
basis of the entire Murrey Math Trading Course. These numbers ace alf natural 8" off of
the base of 10, 108, 1000, 10000, 100000, etc. The part that is most confusing is
balancing this with ibe time element, but based on the information given by Gann himself
it should be obvious that he has already shown us the relationship. For example; If shares
of XYZ stock moved up 121% dollars in 45 days which are degrees of the sun or 45
months (degrees of Saturn) then the stock is on the price degree of x's time angle, that is
to say that price and time are equal or balanced. Gann's example: “When a stock sells at

50 on the 180 day, week or month, it is om the degree of its tame angle”. “On February 1,
1915, U.S. Steel made a low at $38, which is closest to a price of $37%4, which is 3/8° of
{00 and equals 135-degree angle. Siee] was 14 years or 168 months old on February 25,
1915, and bit the angle of 135-degrees, which showed that the price of Sicel was behind
time, but was in a strong position, holding at $38 above the 135-degree angle or the price
$3714", Just to make sure that you understand this information, U.S. Steel would have
been balanced or “on the degree of its time angk” at a price of $46 5/8” because $100/
360-degrees = 0.2777 7cems per degree and 168 months (or degrees of Satu) moktiplied
by 0.27777 = $46.67 which is closest to $46 or 5/8” m price. Therefore, Steel is $8 5/8"
behind time. T.H. Murrey has bis time rules based off the “Harvest Moon” but 1 would
stick to Gann’s definitions when using this natural 8* system as it has a clear degree
relationship 10 price and time. 1 have already discussed these charts previously, when I
went over the Master Mathematical Price & Trend Calculator, Le. The Square of 52.
“When Stee! reached $200, it equaled 2 circles of 360-degrees, When it advanced to
$261%, % was closest 10 362% (5/8) in the third cycle of $100 o¢ nearest the 225-degree
angle or 5/8* point, which is the strongest angfe after k crossed the half-way pois at
$250 or the L80-degree angle”. Note thas Gann rejects the two circles or cycks of $100

price te convert the time ange.

Currently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading between the I* and 2™ cycle of
10,000. This means that 1/8" or 45-degrees = 1250 points of (1250/45) 27.77 points per
day, week, month which as you should have karned earlier, all mean degrees of planetary
movernent or time. As an example, when the Dow made a Sow of 9976 on October 18",

1999 it advanced to a price of 11750 on January 14", 2000. Heboventric Mars moved
55.48 degrees @ 27.77 poimis per degree this would be 154] points added to the 9976
low is 11517 for the price degree angle, This shows that price is ahead of time by 233
points and a correction is needed 10 balance price with time. Also remember that
heliocertric-Mercury moved exactly 360-degrees from iow to high. [f'you divide the low
ptice of 9976 by 27.77 points, you get 359.23 degrees, which also means that beliocemric
mercury has squared out the sow price in time or longitude! Because Mercury's orbit is
$/4* ofa solar year, you can look at this as a4 X E angie. In other words, the Earth
moved 90-degrees from 10/18/99 to 01/14/00 and Mercury moved 4 times as much. The
next mercury square out of this low would be April 111*, 2000 followed by July 8*, 2000.
Sf you divide the January 14" 2000 high of 11750 by 27.77, you get 423.11 degrees, This
would put mercury at 24-degrees of Pisces on July 25", 2000 and would square out the
high price in time oz longitude. The next longitude poim for mercury would be at 27
Taurus on Novenber 27 2000, which is 423.11 degrees added to 24 Pisces. This
technique of utilizing the base of 10, along with the Gann Angles technique described
carfier allow the analyst the ability 10 project price and time out inte the furure. At this
point, you should have a clear understanding of what Gann meant when he said that the
squaring of price by time was one of his greatest discoveries. You can also quickly
calculate aspects of price with this idea. For example: Ai 27.77 points per degree we can
multiply by 30 for the semisextile, 45 for the semisquare, 60 for the sextile, 72 for the
biquintike, etc. This would yield 833.10 points (30°), 1250 points (45°), 1666.2 (60°),
1999.4 (72°). Adding these amounts to the low (9976) gives: 10809.10, 11,266,

11,642.20 and $1,975.40,
Earlier, when we were going over the Square of 9, ] discussed the square root
relationships of this Master Chat. [f you take the square root of the (January 14, 2000)
11,750 high you get 108.39, which equals §8°23" Cancer in exact opposition (0
heliocentric Mercury. Ifyou take the square root of the 9976 low you get 99.87 (9°52
Cancer). The difference between these square roots equals 8.52. From LO¥i8/99 to
1/13/00, Helo-Jupker moved 7.94 and Helio-Saturn moved 3.14 (Pi). Applying the
Pythagorean theorem we get Square root of (7.942 + 3.1492}. This is equal to 8.53, very
close to our root difference of $.52. On 1/14/00, this number will be 2.62. The difference
between 8.62 and 8.52 equals 0.10, which also would equal 18° on the square of 9 as a
root increment. If you add 8.62 to the square root of the low, then re-square, you get
11,772.23 as a price. Remember, increments of 2 added of subtracted to a square root and
then re-squared is equal to 360-degrees on the square of 9. So if we Jook at our number
8.52, we can see that price jumped 4 complete rings oul on the square of 9 because 8
divided by 2 is 4, The fractional remainder of 0.52 tells us thet price went an additional
94.degrees on the square of 9’s rings because 0.50 added or subtracted from a root equals
90-degrees on the square of 9. The remaining balance of 0.02 would equal approximately
d-degrees (180° *0.02 = 3.6%), As we advance day (1°) by day (1*) from our low date,
doesn’t it make sense thet the relationship for price resistance sight have some
mathematical relationship to time on the square of 97 In other words, if we were 45°
{time) away from 10/18/99 wouldn’t you want to know whai prices have a 45°
relationship on the Square of 9 to the 9976 low price? How would you do it? Simple, you
would do it with square root relationships! 45° is calculated by adding or subtracting 0.25
to the square root of the price and then re-square the result. If we do this with the price

35

low of 9976, we would take the root of 9976, which is 99.87 and add 0.25. This is equal
to 100.12. Now we re-square this and get 10,026. The other numbers on this same angle
can be cakulated by adding or suttracting 2 from the square root and then re-square.
100.12 + 2 = 102.12 re-squared = 10,430.52. Get the idea? The next number on the same
angle would be 104.12 squared = 10,843.04 etc, These numbers would be carefully
observed on December 2™, 1999 because this date is 45 solar degrees from 10/18/99. If
you were looking for all the 88° price relationships on the square of 9, when you were
88° (solar time) away from the 10/18/99 low date in price, you would have been looking
for the market 10 hit the following numbers on January 14%, 2000: 10,479.37, 10,892.85,
14,314.32, 11,743,389, 12,181.27, etc! This is almost a perfect price-time balance. The
numbers were calculated as follows: Because adding 2 to a root is equal to 360° on the
square of 9, then adding 0,0055555 is equal to 1° because 2/360 equals .0055555 and this
multiplied by 88° = 4.48. Anoiber way this can be cakulated is 88* /180 = 0.48888.
Adding increments of 2 to this number will give us all the numbers on the square of 9 that
are on the same angle, So we would add 2.48888 to the square root of our 9976 low and
then re-square. Fhis gives us 99.8799 + 2.48888 = 102.3688, Re-squared equaks
10,479.37, as shown above. The other numbers came from adding 4.4888, 6.4888, 8.4888
and 10.4888 to the root of the low price, then re-square the sum. You can also calculate
the numbers that would be on the opposite side of the wheel on this date by adding
14888, 3.4888, 5.4888, 7.4888, etc, because adding or subtracting 1 to the root number

(then re-square} is equal to 180-degrees on the Square of 9.

PEOPIPEAI EISLER OF PIGPEPLEEEEGE

Taseed Thru The Air

This is probably one of Gann’s most important and revealing works, Ironically, it is
probably the least studied book that W.D, Gann wrote. It's a fictional novel that was
written in 1927, and contains “a valuable secret clothed in a veided language”. This is the
first book that Gann wrote, where he “Robert Gordon” gives valuable clues about Bibie
interpretation and Astrology. The book provides examples of Gann’s financial astrology,
mamdane astrology, natal astrology, progression techniques and more. Gann’s
instructions are to read this book 3 times and to read the Bible 3 times to pam wisdom &

knowledge. Gann also made some very interesting forecasts in this book and covers much

of the thought process that went into the predictions,

Robert Gordom’s Great Campaign In Major Motors

On page 197 of Tunnel Thera The Air, the story reads as fallows: On Sunday June
19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for
stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely.
On this day, he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured
that Major Motors would deciine until about June 30™ and then start an advanee, which
would last until about September 16", 1927, when the company would be 19 years old
and at that time the stock would reach a final high and would then go down to February
to April, 1929. He figured that the siock would advance to $270 by September 16% and
made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if 1 wee down around June
30%, and then start buying the stock. On June 30°, it declined and he bought in his short
contracts and bought for long accoun! 500 shares of Major Motors at £92 14. He decided
to pytamid it et the way up. The rest of this section gives specific dates and prices where
Gann (Robert Gordon) bought, sold or moved stops. I am not going to reprint the entire
book 90 I recommend that you study it yourself along with my analysis of this and other
sections of the book.

First, notice the use of the words “about” and “around” used to describe the date June
30", 1927. Looking in an ephemeris, you will find a Total Solar Eclipse on June 29%,
1927. On page 56, you will find Robert Gordon’s interpretation of Ezekiel 32:7: And
when f shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark: I will
cover the sum with a cloud, and the moon shail not give her light. Robert understood 1his

to mean the ewo great eclipses (Total Lunar & Solar eclipses) that would occur in June

1927. Tf we erect a natal horoscope for Major Motors based on the above information
{and instructions from Sephariel’s Arcana} we get the following natal aspects:

The Total Lunar eclipse on June 15", (927 created some negative aspects to Major
Motors natal chart. This lunar eclipse had the Moon in exact opposition to natal Phito and
the Sun Square to the natal Sun, Gam (Robett Gordon) figured that Major Motors would
decline right into the Total Solar eclipse (June 29", 1927} “around” June 30”, This total

Lblsten,

eclipse fell with the Sun Square to netal Satum, The reason Gann expected a Rally from
CA,

this seemingly very negative aspect is because Natil Ssfurn was Retrograde (moving

Backward), When a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed, Le. Good aspects such as

Trines and Sextiles (120 & 60-degrees) become negative and Bad aspects such as

Squares & Gppositions (90,270 and 180) become positive influences. Gann bought long

500 shares of Major Motors at $192% June 30" 1927.

The price of $192% is in opposition 10 Jupter & Uranus (winch are moving towards
conjunction with each other) on Gann’s Hexagon Chart. Gann said thet the stock would
start an advance, which would last until September 16“, 1927 and reach a price of $270.
On the day of the Total Solar Eclipse, Sarum is retrograde st 2-degrees of Sagittarius. On
August 5*, Sarum stops moving retrograde at about 1~degree of Sagittarius and starts
moving forward again. On September 16*, 1927 (the 19 year amiversary of Major
Motors), Saturn will return to it’s exact solar eclipse longitade al 2-degrees Sagittarius,
Providing the timing of this forecas!. The price of $270 is conjunct Jupiter and Uranus on
the Hexagon Chart. The Sun’s “Birthday” return on September 16°, 1927 occurs with
some other negative astrology; Sun conjunct Natai Sun square ta the North Node of the
Moon. . [fyou study the rest of the examples of this “Major Motors Campaign”, you will

find that all of the prices (Buys, Sells, and Stops) are right off the Hexagon Chart. The
Majority of the prices have an angular relationship with Jupiter & Uranus’s longitude.
Saturn is second and then Mars. These are the only planets that are used for price targets
in this example. 1 have provided the astrology program Astrolog, which is available for
free on ibe interne so thal you may study the natal chart and tbe angular relationships 10
price on Gann's Hexagon Chart.

Because 1 have talked about this eclipse method in the coffee Setter and also in the Major
Motors Campaign, I wit show two more examples with beans, One is directly from
Gann, the oiber is my own.

Gam Example: WD Gann was already short May Soybeans during September 1941. He
writes in (How to Make Profits in Commodities, pg. 133) “October 28%, May Soybeans
declined 10 $1554, making a higher bottom by 1 cent and making this a buying level.
The writer covered sborts on this decline”. Analysis: on September 21. 194! there was a
total solar eclipse. Jupiter's longitude at the eclipse was 20-degrees 54° minutes of
Gemini. On October 28", 1941 Jupiter returned to it’s eclipse location at 20 54’ Gemini
and beld above it’s previous bottom by | cent, making this a “buying level”. Gann
covered his short position.

My Example: On August 11%, 1999 there was a total eclipse of the Sun. Soybeans
declined immediately! Jupiter’s location at the eclipse was 4-degrees 42° minutes of
Tanrus. On September 7*, 1999 retrograde Jupiter retums to the exact longitude of 4-42”
Taurus, timing the exact top of this soybean rally. In other words, soybeans declmed
immediately (again) when Jupiter returned 1o the longitude it had during the eclipse!
Jn 1994, Bonnie Lee Hill, did a semmar on Gann’s novel: The Temae) Thru The
Aig. In this seminar, she illustrates some of the Mundane Astrology thai Gann may have
used in his forecasts, Bonnie shows that when there are geocentric aspects between
Uranus, which symbolizes change and Neptune, which symbolizes wates, the Mississippi
River Floods. The aspect must occur in the winter, which means that the Sun is between
0° Capricorn and 0° Aries. This specific petiod of time is also symbolic of ibe 3 days
Jonah was in the whale’s belly and the bible statement that Gann said had a secret
meaning; “For as Joneh was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; 90 shall the
Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”. This is from Matthew
£2:38, 39 and 40. Notice that the Saviour does not say the Son of God. He says the “Son
of man”, which ] believe refers to the Sun. ,
Typos] Thru the Air page 69 (95), Gann said iat this was the key to the interpretation of
the future. This allegory regarding three days and nights has been told in many different
ways by several religions. 1 believe that it is a story about the Sun (“the son or Sun of
man”) as * symbolically dies on the cardinal (cross) sign Capricorn ducing the Winter
solmice on December 21°, 22™ each year. Three days later on December 25%, the
birthday of Christ, Apollo, Horus etc., the days start to become noticeably ionger. Three
months (“days”) tater, the Sun reaches 0-degrees Aries a1 the Vernal Equinox on March
21* each year. “Lamb of Gad, you take away the sins of the world”. This is the pom
where the sum starts to move north of the equator. This is why Easter is always based on
the Full moon following the Vemal Equinox in April. From this point on, the amount of
daylight increases and the Sun increases in strength as it rises from the grave of winter
until the Summer Solstice in the cardinal sign of Cancer June 23". As far as the

91

significance for interpretation of the future, [ peeve that Gann may have been referring
to the ingress of the sun into Aries and also the nodes of the other planets. The planetary
nodes and conjunctions of the major planets are used for the practice of Mundane
Astrology, along with the solar ingress into each of the four cardinal signs with primary
emphasis on the vernal equinox. “O, ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but
can ye not discern the signs of the times?” Another possibility is that the planets have
more influence when the Sun is in the grave of winter.

Bonnie, also shows that droughts are caused by aspects of Saturn, which symbolizes
restriction or depression, and Neptune (water). Again, the aspect between Saturn &
Neptune must occur while the Sun is “in the grave”. This would retate to high prices
because droughts huct supply. Ideal growing conditions (Bumper Craps) are caused by
aspecis between Jupiter, which symbolizes abundance, and Neptune (water). The aspect
between Jupiter and Neprune must occur while the Sun is between Capricorn and Aries.
This canses low prices because supply exceeds demand when there are bumper crops.
Bomnie made some long term cotton forecasts based upon this information and they have
been 100% accurate? The only year that did noi come out was the year 1999, but Bonnie
said in $994 that this would probably be a non-event. The reason is that there were
aspects between the two indicators, Jupmer-Neptune and Seturn-Neptune. One is calling
for s drougim, the other Weal conditions. She expected ibese cirournstances to cancel each
other out and that is basically what happened. Looking over Bonnie’s serninar handout ]
have found that she allows these aspects to occur as late as the end of April. This would
correlate to the mouth of the constellation Cetus, ibe whale, which would have the Sun in

the sign of Taurus, Remember Cetus- The Whale, which symbolically swallowed Jonah?

This constellation rans from Pisces to Taurus, the whales belly is in Pisces when the sun
would be south of the equator, corresponding to the month of February and the mouth
where Jonah is spit out is in Taurus (sun is now north of the equator) corresponding to
April the month that Jesus rises from the dead on Easter. 40 days later Jesus said; “the
son of man” ascends into heaven ta be seated a1 the right band side of his Sather.

Another Mundane cycle is the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Every time these
planets have conjoined during a U.S. presidential election year, the president has died in
office. The only exception to this was Ronald Regan, who was shot but did not die. This
was the first time that the conjunction did not take place in an earth sign 90 this may have
some significance. The conjunction of hupiter-Setumn in June of 2000, takes place in
Taurus, an earth sign 50 the forecast would be that the elected president dies in office.

Luther Jensen’s work shows that major wars involving the United States have
occurred when Uranus is in the signs of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces, Uranus
enters Pisces, August of 2003 so we would expect the possibility of a major military
event around this time period,

One othee Market retated nrundane cycle is the superior and inferior conjunctions
of Mereury with the Sun. In Jeanne Long’s book Universal Clogis, she says that she
found an ancient! clay tablet in the British Museum, while researching Gam. She said thet
ibe tablet correlated future wheat prices based upon the heliacal rising of Mercury. In
other words, it predicted the future price of wheat in terms of “what was in the past wil
be in tbe future”. She shows several Soybean examples where the price range of

Soybeans at the superior conjunction retums at the inftrior conjunction. In other words, if

the price range wes 420 to 425 during the superior conjunction, then expect soybeans to

Tetum to this basic price area at ibe inferior conjunction. She says that approximately
70% of the time this will be accurate. The times where the price does not retum to the old
range are usually related by increments of 12 cents. For example, ifor second date did
pot return to the original price area of 420 to 425 it will probably be 12, 24, 36, 48, etc.
cents higher or lower. This technique is supposed to work for both Wheat and Soybeans
but ] would recommend that you do your own cesearch in this area. Gann says “Prove all
things to yourself and bold on to what is good”.
Gann’s Personal Soybean Letter

T have provided a copy of this ktter in the back of the material. Please read it over
before reading this section. First, 1 will show you where Gann is getting some of the
prices be is using in this better thet are not listed as Major highs or lows. In the frst
paragraph, Gann says “The one-balf point of the highest selling price and one-half
between the high and low are very great because these equal the 45-degree angle or the
gravity center. For May Beans these prices are 218 3/8, 240 3/8, 251 7/8, and 319 1/8”.
On this page you will find four prices that are hard to explain. These are $218 3/8, $240
3/8, $251 7/8 and $319 1/8. The first price is the midpoint of the $436 % high (436 / 2).
The 240 3/8 price is the extreme low of 44 + the high of 436% divided by 2 (436 %-4d=
480 % /2). The 251 7/8 price is the low price at 67 + the high price 436 % divided by 2.
Finally, the 319 1/8 price is the low at 201 % + 436 % high divided by 2. Gann then starts
adding praportionate parts of the circle to these prices. He is also directly referencing the
corresponding zodiac Songitude (0 the price levels. What he is doing is creating an
Astrological aspectarian of price. He is wying ta caiculate where the Trines and squares
are to diffetert price levels. Gann said that these where the “natheatatical reasons” why

Soybeans made a bottom at $2014. The extreme low a1 44 + 360 = 404, Both of these
prices would equal 14 Taurus. The midpoint or one-haif point is 202 (404/2) = 22 Libra,
The low of 201 4 occurred February 9, 1949, This price is equal to 15 Leo on the
“Circle Chart”. On this date, you will find Pinto at 15 Leo {conjunct the price), Neptune
at 15 Libra (60° to price), Jupiter is 150° to price, etc.

The next part of the letter talks sbout active or live angles. “By live or active angles is
meant Prices and Time Periods where the longitude of the major planets are or where
che squares, triangles, oppositions are to these planets”, “Examples of live, active angles:
Al the present writing, Jan. 18°, 1954, Saturn Geocentric is 8° 10 9°-degrees Scorpio.
Add the square or 90-degrees gives 8° to 9°-degrees Aquarius and equals the price $309
for May Beans”. He then does the same aspect procedure for Jupiter at 2] Genin - 135°-
degrees = 306 or 6° degrees Aquarius. In this paragraph, Gann is using puce Jongitude to
price conversions. In the next paragraph Titled 24 Revolations of Time aud Price Gann
is using the Circle Chart. An interesting thing about Gann’s frst examp% of an “active
angle” is celated to the first trade horoscope (natal) for Soybeans. Gann said “October 5“,
1936, futures trading sterted in Soybeans. The first sake was 120”. If we cast a horoscope
for this date, we can actually see why Saturn’s position is “active”.

From the shove example, you can see that Satur was “active” because x was transiting
natel Venus and wes in opposition to natal Uranus. Jupier was “active” by a conjunction
with the natal moon at 17° Gemini, Gann says, “The power of Saturn and Jupiter aspects,
working oul time to these Price Resistance Levels, is what halts the advance in
Soybeans”.

Gann then moves on to his cirek chart. He instructs his student to circle all the Low
prices with a red circle and all the highs with a green circle. Then nate the Angles of 45,
60, 90, 120, 135, 180, 225, 240, 270, 300, 315, and 360 from cach high and low, These
are not geometric angles! These are astrological angles on the circle chart or "Master
Chart”, Gann then gives an example for December 2, 1953, May Soybeans high $3 11%.
If you place the planets on the circle chart, you will get tbe prices Gann is talking about.
‘When he mentions thal this price is 180°-degrees of the averages he is talking about the
MOF Formuta, CE Average or the Average of Six that I discussed earlier. He says *
Having before you all the information outlined above, you would certainly have gone
short of May Soybeans on December 2°, 1953 and covered your shorts on December 17”
at 296 because the prive was down to the 45-degree angle from 44 on the monthly high
Jow chart”. The Monthly high low chart indicates Gann was referring to 2 Satum.
geometric angle from the low price of 44, When you read Gann, you can almost ahvays
substitute the word month for Satum. The 44 ow occurred December 1932. From this
time period 19 December 1953, h-heliocentric moved 267.067 degrees, The 11'4 angle @
0.9375/degtee would = $250.375 + 44 low = $294.375 which is within 1 5/8 cents of
Gann’s 296 price. Using Gann’s shortcut method, December 1932 to 1953 = 21 years
times 12 (months) = $252 + 44 = $296. The low of the move was $295, The shoricut
method was within a 1 full point ot $50.00 per contract the astrological method was only
off by 5/8ths of a cent or $31.25 per contract.

Another interesting point about ibe 296 price that Gann said to cover the short position
is that on this particular day, Pluto's first trade longitude was activated by a transiting

square of Mars, i.e. Mars square natal Pluto, Pluto’s natal position is 28 Cancer which =

$296 on the circk chart. The $296 price is also square 10 Neptune and conjunet the hinar
node geocertricaily on Dec. 17, 1953.

Getting back to some of the earlier parts of the Soybean Letter, the $218 3/8”
price would equal 8° Scorpio, which is opposite natal Uranus and conjunct natal Venus,
Gann also tells us that the low price on the day of the first trade chart was $1.20, Because
the minimum fluctuation of beans al this time was one 1/8* of a cent, then 0.45 cents
would equal 360°, because 1/8* of 360 is 45° of cents, Then, $1.20 / 0.125 is 9.60 and
9.60/45¢a complete price circle) is 0.21333333 and 0.21333333 mukiplied by a zodiac
circle of 360° is 76.80 or 76°48" of a circle or 16°48” Gemini, which is equal to the
longitude of the natal moon far beans. 17° is a hot longitude degree for soybeans because
you have the natal moon at 17° Gemini, Satum at 17° Pisces and Neptune at 17° Virgo.
Moving Jupiter, 77 degrees, which is equal to 17° Gemini or the natal moon produces
interesting turning poinls in beans. The highest price up to the date that this letter was
written was $436 %, in January of 1948. On this date, you had Geocentic Jupiter return
to his natal position, Saturn conjunct the Natal Midheaven, and Neptune Corjaunct the
natal Sun. Aso, Mars had mede 5 complete round trips and returned to bis natal position
on this date, The price of $436 % -90 is 346.75 or 17 Pisces, which is the longitude of
natal Saturn. $436 % is also within 2 cents from exact opposition of Jupiter’ natal return
longitude of 18°55" Sagittarius. In the letter, Gann also iustrates ihat $436 % -360 is $76
$, which is equal 10 16°45" Gemini within % cent of L7 Gemini. The low price of $67
occurred on July 24, 1939. From tbe first trade date of October 5, 1936, heliocentric

Jupiter moved 88°48" and beliocentric Saturn moved 34°44". The 224° angle of Jupiter

97

would be 12°0.125 = 1.5 and 1,5/45° = 0.0333333 and this mukiplied by 22,5 is 0.75
points per degree. Therefore, 88.81 * 0.75 equals $66.65 for the Jupiter angle. The Saturn
22'4° angle would cross ai $65.14 at 1.875 points per degree. Both of these calculations
are the angles up from “0” from the first trade date of the futures contract, The sun also
moved 1008.63 degrees, which is 33.3 months and 2*33.3 = 66.6, same as Jupiter. 1008
reject two circles or 720 is 288, which is the second square of twelve, ie. 12 *12 = 144
and 144 * 2= 288. The June 15, 1930 cash high price at 216, which Gann says “Equals 6
Scorpio”; we have on this day, heliocentric Saturn at 8°06" Capricom or 278.1 and
heliocentric Neptune at 2°53” Virgo or 152.88. Therefore, the midpoint is 278,1+152.88
= 430.98 and this divided by 2 is 215% very close to 216 price. Also, heliocentric Vetus.
is at L5° Virgo, sextile the price, Mercury is at 16° Aquarius, square or 90° to the price,
Neptune is 45° 10 the price in Virgo, etc. Mercury and Venus are not typically important
in this type of calculation, but when you have them supporting the numbers generated by
the large outer planets namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, it is a very nice

bonus.

Ma Volame

In the back of this work, you will find a two-page course that I bebeve was written by
Gann Titled: MARKET TRENDS. This course deals with market trends and the
correlation between transactional volume. Gann says, “ The trend of stock prices is
influenced by supply and demand. The object of following  chact is to determine
whether stocks are in a period of accumulation, or distribution; whether stocks are being
marked up or down, or whether they are being left alone”. It is suggested that you read
this small course at this time and also Gann's course on Form Reading, which is also
included with this document.

Now that you have had time fo review the above referenced material, I wit! discuss my
opinion of vohmme and it’s significance in forming an opinion on the markets, Because
there is always a seller for every buyer, and a buyer for every seller on any given day
with the exception of Limit moves and Panics, volume simply records the total number of
units thal resuhed in a transaction between the buyer and seller. The volume data in this
format has limited uses but there are several books that have been written by various
authors discussing how to interpret market movements from this raw form of the data.
My petsonal view is thet volume needs 10 be converted 90 that il more accurately
represents buying pressure and selling pressure or supply vs. demand. Because we
already know that you must have a buyer for every seller and vice versa before eny
volume can be recorded, we need io determine how this number of unis relates to price
fluctuations, If we take the fundamental view that the only reason prices advance is
simply because there was 2 greater demand to purchase the stock or commodity than

there was a willingness to sell the item at the current existing peice. Prices decline
because there is a greater willmgness lo sell the stock or commodity verses the demand
for the item at the current price. Selling panics occur when there are no buyers for the
item at the current price or even substantially lower prices (zero demand driven). Buying
panics occur when there are no s<lkts at the current price and is obviously a supply

Many anatysts have argued that the supply of any stock or commodity is definable
simply because you can not instantly create more coffee, corn, oil or shares of a particular
stock. These analysts believe that the available supply of the item is what creates the
demand that will eventually show up as volume or a transaction between buyer and seller.
However, this point of view is not entirely accurate because short selling creates fictional
of phantom unks of the particular kem and therefore distorts or enlarges the available
supply of the xem. This means that to make volume understandable, we must look at it,
as if relates to the desire to buy or sell any #em at a given moment and we musi also

What I like to do to determine this desire is to look al the percent change up or down
on 4 given day and emulliply this fraction by the volume on that day. For example: kets say
that Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) is up $1.00 today on 55 milion shares from 77% the
day before. The % change is | divided oy 77% or 0.0128. This fraction multiplied by the
vohume of 55 million shares is 707,395 and represents the lack of selling desire or excess
demand. If the price had declined $1.00 on this volume it would represent the lack of

100

buying desire or a greater supply. So based on the advancing scenario, we would assurne
tha of the 55 million shares traded this day, that desire to buy exceeded the willingness
to sell by 707,395 shares. This number will now et us separate ihe Supply & Demand
forces as it relates to whole volume. 55,000,000 divided by 2 § 27,500,000 and this
tepresents perfect balance of desire to sell and willingness to buy. 27,500,000 — 707,395
= 26,792,605 (supply) and 27,500,000 + 707,395 = 28,207,395 (demand), You can plot
these numbers on graph paper or have # spread sheet program fke Microsoft Excel
maintain the chart and data. This will give you a much better visual picture of the
psychology in the market as it pertains to Gann’s rules on vohime, Another valuable
calculation is to take the supply vohime numbers and divide them by the total number of
shares that the company actually has issued (for a commodity, use the Government
estimates of supply). This ratio will show the percentage of turnover in the stock or how
acaively the stock is changing hands, When a stock is in “strong” hands, this mumber is
low because the big block share bokders have fittk if any willingness to sell. When
distribution is taking place (Form reading + Cycle Timing), this nurober will show a
pretty dramatic increase compared to it’s relative history during the up trend or “Matk-
up” phase. The market is chuming as the inventory is moving from strong to weak hands.
This information shoult help you with volume analysis and as a usefull tool for

imlerpreting the action of the markets.

This concludes my personal analysis of Gann techniques. This wark was pot
intended to teach you how to trade or to provide trading advice. [t was intended 10 give
you a deeper insight into the mote veiled and esoteric aspects of Gann’s work. This was
obviously intended for more serious students of Gann’s methods. I do not claim to be a
“Genn expert” to do so would be foolish. Most of the so-called “Ganm experts” bave
absolutely no idea how Gamn accomplished what he did. 1 believe that [ have some
valuable pieces of the puzzle but [ have much too much respect for the man to call myself
anything more than a student. Il realize that this material bas been crasnmed full of
information and that # seems overwhelming. However, if you put in the study time, I
think thet % will come 10 you and you will be rewarded for your efforts. After all, I did
nat have the luxucy of this material when I started! If you were looking for some practical
trading advice, I would suggest that you read each of the following Gann courses at least
3 times each:
{1) Speculation A Profitable Profession — A course of instructions on Grains,
(2) Mechanical Method & Trend [ndicetor For Trading in Grams
(3) Form Reading
{4) Forecasting
By studying this material along with the work ] have provided, [ believe that you will be
rewarded! [ should also point out that Gann's rules on Time or Space overbalance,
volume of sales and form reading are meant to be tools to belp his students find the
underlying cycles in the market,

| have catculated the angles based on the minimum fluctuation of 0.05 (based on
the futures contract). Both Satum's and Jupiter's 75-deg angie would cross neat
the high of 1553. The reason | would do it this way is that | want to know which
Gann angle is being hit per the instructions given in the course material.
Saturn's 75-deg angle would move up at {0.05 x 50) = 2.5 points/deg x 604.9 =
1512.25 + 16.65 21528.90

Jupiter's 75-deg angle would move up at (0.05 x 20) = 1.0 points/deg x 1632 =
1532 +16.65 = 1548.65

Uranus's 75-deg angle would move up at (0.05 x 140) = 7.0 pisideg x 224.28
1569.96 +16.65 =1586.6t

As Imention in my Gann Unveiled course, these are my 3 favorite planets to
work with. The average of the 3 Is 4864.16 divided by 3 = 1554.72. The actual top

The other things | looked at, was Jupites was exactly $40-deg from the 6/12/62

Low, and the conjunction of Mars & Saturt took place on the ‘hor’ degree of 18-
40 Taurus.

The 56.25 degree angle up from "0" from the July 7th, 1932 tow has the following
calculations:

Jupiter {0.05 x t5) = 0.75/deg, Jupiter moved 2054.36 so this gives 1540.78
Saturn (0.06 x 37.50) = 1.875/éeg. Saturn moved 827.79 80 this gives 1552.08
Uranus (0.05 x 105) = §.25/deg. Uranus moved 297 so this gives 1559.25

.

The average of the 3 is 1550.70. So we have two important Time/price angles
within 3 points of each other at this major top. if you take the average of 1554.72 +
1150.7, you get 1552.7],

SINCW RAAOVET MANEIING

In his book “Impending C 2001”, author Richard Mazzie shows the dominance
ofthe 18-year Sinusoidal wave cycle in the U.S, Stock Market. This cyck is related to
the 180-degree synodic cycle of Saturn and Neptune. For those interested in long range
forecasting, the angle between Saturn & Neptune was 118.31 or 118-deg 18-min (before
Opposition) al the September 3", 1929 Top (see graph above). This angle moved 180-deg
(18-yts} to an angular separation of 61.69 or 6l-deg 41-min (before conjunction) on
March 30°, 1947, Eighteen years later, the angle between Saturn & Neptune return to the
beginning value of 118.31 on January 29", 1966. Adding another 180-deg or 18 years
takes us to October 2™, 1982 when the planets are separated by the angle of 61.69 again.
On June 24", 2001, the angle will once again be 118.3] completing an 18-year up-cycle
that began im 1982. Each 18-year cycle is 1/8 of Gann's 144-year period or the square of
12, The 120-deg harmonics of this cycle are also strong. For example, adding 120-deg to
the 9/3/29 top gives an angle of 121.69 (afier opposition) of 121-deg 41-min. This
occurred on December 22", 194) at a major stock market low 2 weeks afler the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor and effectively ending the Great Depression. When yau combine
this cyc}e with the 90~deg Uranus % cyck, which is also sinusoidal, you can immediately
see why the Bull Market was so strong from 1982 to present. The Uranus 4 cycle
basically runs from 0-deg 4]-minutes of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittaris, and Pisces

(HIN, Pend 3), with tops oecusting in Wpand 3{ and bottoms in TI and >. Both of these
dominant sinusoidal cycles bottomed in 1982, giving rise to the greatest bull market
advance in U.S. history. Another sinusoidal cycle that has a strong market effect is 90-
deg of the Lunar North Node. For exampic, at the July 8*, 1932 Low, the Node was at
20-deg 34, subtract 90 because the node is always retrograde, gives 20-deg », which
occurred on March 8*, 1937 1wo days before the exact high. Subtract another 90-deg
gives 20-deg Th, which happened on November 2%, 1941, etc. Last but not least, there is
a sinusoidal cycle of 40 to 44 months. According to the Foundation For The Study of
Cycles, this cycle was discovered when a New York firm hired a mathematician to
discover the secret of the Rothchilis investment success, This cycle shows up as a
sinusoidal wave, i.¢. up for 20 months, then down for 20 months. This cyck was
extremely dominant in stock market data from 1871 to 1946, The Astronomical
correlation is 60-deg synodic movements of Fupiter & Satum Top to Top or Bottom to
Bottom.or 30-deg up then 30-deg down.

ample: If the top of a stock is 28, this Square of 26 x 26 would represent .

— Squaring the Price by Time, because if we have 28 polnts up in rice, and we awe

PATTERN CHART POR GEOMETRICAL ANGLES

. The Square of 90, or the Pattern Chart, shows all the measured angies that
are Important.to use in determining the position of @ ateck. These angles are as
follows: 3%, 7h, 16, 182, 264. 30, 33%, 37%. 68, 52k, 564, &, 638, ls, 7,
824, Ohh, and 00 degtees,

Iv ie nou necessary to measure these angies with & protractor. All you have
to do to geb the angles correct is to count the spaces on the chart paper, using
-8 x 8 to the Inch, and draw the lines oc angles accordingly,

On the square of 90, which you will receive with these instructions, note
how equal angles drawn from the top and from the betton Prove themselves by the
point at which they cross. For example:

The angie of 8 x 1 drawn from "0" and the angle of @ x 1 drawn from "90"

—sown doth cross at 45, 5-5/8 pointe over from “O" counting to the right. Then,

the angie of 4x1 fron "0" and the angie of 4 x 1 down from "90", you will

otice, cross at 344 on 45, equidistant from the other angle and twice the
measure. The reason why these angles prove this way ls because the 45° angle

or 45 pointe or degrees fro "0" to 45 i@ one-half of 90. Therefore, parallel

angles beginning at "0" gojng up and at 90 coming dawn, omsl cross on a 45° angle

or at the gravity center, : .

_ An example marked "Porm 2” shows you the most important angles to use when
@ stock is working higher and advancing. (See page 61 .

_EURST IMPORTANT GROMETRICAL ANGLE: The first and always most important angle to
as® or 1x} draw ls a 45-degree angie or # new ing~average
that moves up one point per day, one point
per week cr one point per month. This is a 45° angle because it divides the Space
“and Time Periods into twa equal parte. As long as the market or a stock stays
adove Lhe 4$° angle, it ia ina strong position and indicates higher prices. You
can buy every time & stock rasis on the 45° angle with a stop loses order one, Lwo

For exemple; If the tine is za dcys, 2@ wooks, or 28 menths fram tho Polat whers

turned up.

It ie also imporvam yo review the major swing from November 9, 1931, when
Ube Averages reached a high of 119%, to the low at 404 in July, 1932. This was
the lael big swing of the bear merket, a decline of 79 points. The half-way
point of this was at 80. In September, i933 the Averages rallied be 6l-— then
after Ubey reacted to 50 ard advenced, getting above the half-way point, and
crossed 81, they indicated an advance to 110 anyway. After they crossed the -
half-way point the second tlme and advancee abore 61, thay never sold down to it
again util they advanced to 14¢4 in Movenber, 1935,
After a stock has deen advancing for 6 tong time, in the Jast run when ther

decline and ts making bottom, it will drop under important angles and then re-
cover quickly, getulng above tham, which shows that tt is getting inte a strong
position and changing trend.

ANGLES FROM HIGHER E

‘What rule should be followed when stocks wake higher bottoms and lower vops?

As stocks advance and-make higher bottoms on the monthly, weekly or daily
chart, you should always draw angles from higher bottoms. Then, In the last

section of a bull markat, if these important engles are’ broken from the last bot
tom, you know that the trend has turned dom.

‘Apply this same ruze as a market declines. Draw the angles from each lower ~
top and walch the angles uit] the atocks again cross the 45° angle from 4 secer ,
vbird, or fourth loser top. The eecond lower top or second higher bottom is al-
ways very Important to draw angles [rea am! to measure Time from as well.

Exampla: Dow-Jones Industriel Averages—
Septenber 3, 1929 - Extrem high-
Novenber 13, 1929 - Bottom of first sharp decline~ -
April —-£7, 1930 - Big rally in bear mrket, second lower top-
duly 8, 1932 - Bxtrese low, final bottom
September 6, 1932 - Top of Ciret sharp advance after bear market —
ended-
. -Webrusry and March, 1983 - Second higher bottom from which bull
warket was resumed. .
These are the moat Lopertant tgpe and botvons to draw angles from.

SECTIONS OP MARKET CAMPAIGHS:

. All market campaigns, up or down, move in 3 to 4 sections. When an advance
starts, the markel runs ‘for several weeks or several months and then halts for
several weeks of months, moving up and down over a range of S Le 20 points, ac-~ —
cording to the price of the etock—then the advance is resumed and the stock
crosses the high level of the first section, moves higher, halte again, and reac.<
for 5 period of time-- then crosses the Lop pf the second section end moves up
again for another period of time and tage for the third Lime, which is a very
Important point to watch as markels often culminate at the end of the third
section and a bigger dectine follows,
GA-2)

Moot marketa run out in three importam sectlons or campaigns. However,
efter resting and reacting, if a stock crosses Che third top, lt will then hove
up bo the Lop of the fourth section, This fourth advance may be a shorter per kod
ot time Chan the previous sect ions, of in some casex may consume & greater period
of tine, especially if the stock is very active and high-priced. This fourc top

is very tmportant and Generally marks a culmination and a reversal for a bigger
decline.

Por example; On March 12, 1935 CHRYSLER MOTORS dect ined and made low at 31—

PIRST SECTION of the advance carried the eveck up to 497 on May 16-
then the stock declined to 414.

SECOND SECTIOW— On June 27 the advance started and the stock advanced to
haw high levels, reaching 623 on August 10, which was top

of the second section. then there was a reaction to S%%
ard & reaving period.

THIRD SECTION—- Then vhere was another advance which started August 28.
The etock crossed. the top of the secomM section and reached

high at 74 on September 11, top of the third section, Then
followed a reaction 40 69 on Septerber 22,

FOURTH SECTION— In October the t of the third section was crossed and
on Noverber 18 Chrysler reached W, vop of the fourth
Section, where It held for 5 weeks in a G~point range while
dletribution was taking place, This was a most ipportant
‘point to watch for a final top and a change in trend. Then
the trend turned down,

Reverse this rule in a bear market, Natch the action of the sarket when it

_ makes the third and fourth decline. But, remenber, in a bear smrket when rale

lies com, hey may make only one section of one move or in extreme cases only
make the second section then reverse ax follow the main trend town.

You wil find it very:hetpful to study and watch these various sactlone of
& campaign and by applying the angles from Lope and bottoms you can detect the
first minor and mm jor changes in trend,

The angies om the Monthly and Weekly Charts are Of greater importance than
hose on the Dally Chart because the daily trend can change quite often, while
rf

t
Re major changes are shown secording to the angles on the Monthly and Week-
ta, .

Always consider the distance a stock is from its beginning point whan it
breaks any important angle or crosses any important angle. The further away from
the beginning point, the more important the change in trend, whether this is
crossing an angle from the top or breaking wer an angle from the bottom-

s f H

A stock is In the weakest position when ic has completed distribution and
breken under a 45° angle from an important bottom on the “weekly or monthly chart.
It im aleo in the weakest position when it has broken under the half-way point
between any important Lop or bollom, The longer the time period has run and
the higher the price, whe weaker ¢he Position, Por exampic!

from Cops and botroms on the semi-weekly chart, you will often get an Lind Leat Lon

of a charge in trend two to three days before a change in trend 49 shown on the
weekly chart,

A change in trend on’ the ‘semi-weekly charL Is of greater importance than a
change (n trend on the daily chart. It is much betler to rely upon this chart
Vhan on the daQiy chart when markets are in a narrow trading rage.

Years of experience and research, which has cost mee targe amount of money
have enabled me to develop a method that will account for a) varket poverants
and give rules to determine the trend fron eny top or bolton.

{ty ia important vo know how te determine the trend when a stock Is first
ilsted on any exchange. When s stock has never fluctuated before, we have no top
or bottom to draw angles from, Therefore, In order to determine the trend, we
use the square of 90, which I $0 op and 90 across, and put all the naturai angles
on, lke the Pattern Chart. As we have sald before, the square of 90 la very
important because it is one-quarter of a circle of 360°, and as 90° ox the vere

tical angle is the greatest angle that can be ured, all of the other angles are
found between "0" and 199", .

Tf 8 new stock opens at 18 or any polnt below 224, then you could make out o
Square of 224 to determine the position of the stock on angles. if the stock
gpened at 36 or any point between 224 and 45, you could make up a square of 45.
If it opened at $0 of between 45 and 67, you’ could make up a square of 674. How
ever, you could place any stock opening at any price below 90 in the square of
© end get ita proper position and. etrength or weakness on angles. If the stock
opened at 100 or above 00 end under 135, you could make up a equare of 155, or
could make another square of 90 mumbering from 90 to 18.

You could start a monthly chart on a square of 90 at tha price where the
ttock epi oe trading begins, as shom on U, S, Steel. (Refer to Special Analy-
sis of U, S. Steal. } Afcer the atock breake any of these netursl angles dram
from “O*, -it-is just the same ag breaking under an angle dram fron a dotton,
When lt crosses any of the anglea dram dom from "90", it ie fost the same as
crossing an angle from a top, as you can ese by experimenting with U. S, Steel
or any other stock, bul always <onsider Price resistance levels and how mith the
stock is up or dom from the botton or .tep. You can determine the Cirst change in
trend by the 3-day or semiweekly Chart, dally chart, and weakiy chart by. bring Ing

up the important Geometrical Angles from any higher or lower bottom as the market

- QUICK CALCUT ATION OF ANGLES

Tt Ls not necessary to draw these angles from & point a jong wy back.

You can make the calculation and determine where they cross. For examle: Sup-

Calculate where the 45° angie will cross 10 years later in January, 1910, The

TIME PERIODS FROM TOPS

After a atock has advanced and mode en axtrome high end reacted for a fer
days, o fommoks, or a few months, end you stert putting on the ongles frou the = —
top dom, you must then begin to number the tine periods aerees frou the top.

Apply the came rule fer the top: The wonth, week or day that a etook makes exe
treoe high finishes the upward woveaent end is not to be counted. You can comt —
the number of days, weeks or months Roving aorosa efter that, ellowiug the top
eth to be "O°. the next month, woek oy day over to be "1", adding 4 across on
the squares to get the correct position, If this Mme Period is carried sorcas
on all the charts correctly, then you can @lwoys cheok up and find out if you
have made ony mistake in bringing dows the anglos or moving-overage lines.

Por exemple: After a stook has declined 75 points, either on a weekly or ~
nenthiy chart, the ougles mrvo down the temo, except whore the spacing is dif-
ferent. Assuming thet the spnoing is one point fr cue—tighth inch, after it hes

order to prove exoctly whore the mgle of 2 x 1 coms out, you deternine the
nanber of tins periods there are, If 40 days, weeks or months hove bem required —
to deoling tha 78 points, the angle of 2 x 1 moving dom 2 points per wit of
-time, would be diwa g6 fron the top. If you find that this angle does rot sross

the top. Suppose the price raferrod to above, whon the stock hag declined 73 ~
points, was 180, thea subtracting G0 from the top’ st 156, the angle tonld cross

The most important point on the monthly high and low chart te corry the

ways be carried apross on the chart just the same as the important angics should

bo continued right along for years, ‘ -

The next important point to number from 43 a socond or third higher bottom,

.
Ga-27

but you should nou consider a bottom established unvil the markey has hele up or
advanced three to four months, then comence numbering from that botton if it
appears to be important. For example:

. US. STEEL was incorporated February 25, 1901. Numbering the months across
you will note thar February, 193), was 360 ponths, of 30 yoars, from q
the date of incorporation. Then start a new cycle and begin numbering across
from "0". This will be working out the second cycle or circle of 360°,

The next important point is the extrese low of 83 made May 14, 1904. On
the monthly chart carry the munbers across fram uhis bottom, because It js the

Jowest bottom and therefore the moet Important. Note this eyear cycle or
380 months enied May, 1934,

The next important point to number from ant draw the angies from, is the low
of 215 in Gevober, 1907, the first higher bouton. Then, the next Important ts
the third higher bottom made in February, 1915. Alwaya draw the englea and run-
ber the moriths-across from any other important bottoms where campalgns start.

Use this same rule at topa. After top is reached and vhe trend turns down,
hen carry the time nunbere across from the Lop, but after any top La crossed
o¢ bottom is broken that you are numbering from, then de nob count that Lop or
bottom of i tance to mumber fram; except, to deteralne 4 tim period on another
cycle 3, 5, 7; 10 ce 20 years nhead. Tope that stay for a long time without bee
log crossed are alvays the most important to carry the Tine Periods fron. The
extreme high reached by a etock ie always moat Amporvant until that high ls
Cressed= then the next high point made on a secondary rally, which is always a
lower top;"is tha next tmost impeetant top lo number fron. For example:

Om U. S, Steel Pits would carry ‘the monthly measurement across firat from
the high in 4pr12-2601- then from tha ‘extreme high in Cetober, 1609, ant next
from the high in May, 1917- then from the final high ia sare 1929, being
the mot important to measuré from, and also mmber from 1 Ape hl, 1930 top.

Apply thls same rule to weekly and daily boltoms and tops. Discontinue the .

The rule for discontinuing the use of tops and bottoas Tor Time Periods is:

SQUARING THE PRICE RANOE WITH TIME

This is one of the most important and valuable discoveries that I have ever
mace, and if you stick surletly to the rule, and always watch a stock when Price
‘is squared by Tlme, or when Time and Price come Gogether, you will be able to
forecast the important changes ln trend with greater accuracy.

The squaring of Price with Time means as equal number of points up or dawn
balancing an equal mucber of tlm periods-—either days, weeks or months. Por
example: If a stock has advanced 24 points in 24 days, then moving the 4$°
angle cr moring-averege-line up at Lhe rate of one point per day, the tiaing
tine or Lime period and the price of the stock are at the same level and the
stock ls resting one 45° angle and you should watch for an Important change in
trend at this point. If a steck is te continue uptrend and remin ina strong
position, i¢ mist continue to advance and keep above the angle of 45°, If it
breaks back under this angle, then it se out of ite square on the bear side of

- the 45° angle and in a weaker position. ‘hen you are aquaring out Time on a

daily chart, look at the weekly high and low chart and monthly high and low chart
ard eee if the stock is ina strong position and has yet to run cut the time
periods, because on a daily chart it hae to react ard then recover a position,
squaring its price maoy times, as long as the weekly and xonthly poimt up,
Market corrections or reactions are siaply the squaring out of minor tine periods
and later the big declines or big advances are the squaring out of major tim -
per lode. .

SQUARING THE RANGE: Refer to Form #12, where a Tange of 12 points is sham
‘from 48 low to 60 high. Now, suppose a stock regmins for
several wesks or several months, moving up or dam, in this range, never getting
nore than 12 points up from the bottom and not breaking the bottom: Me start
the 45° angle from the bottom of 48 and move it up to the Lop of the range to
&C, then when we eee the atock is holding thl¢ range and not going higher, we
wove the 45° angle back to the bottom: then back ta the top of the range again,
moving it up or down oyer this range until the stock dreaks out into new low
levels or new high levels. You vlJ3 find that every time the 45° angie reaches

the top of thie range or the bottom of this range, there is som important. change
in trend of the efock, = «|

You can aleo use the argles of 2 x 1 to the right of the 45° argle and the

2x1 tothe lef, as they egain djrlde the Time Period imo two @qual parts and
ere of seo value. ‘

Tf a stook finally moves out of this range on the up side, then the angles
would begin at the naw and higher bottom and move up, but from the polnt where
the eteck went into new high, of Crom any Important botlon sade while it was in
the range, especially uhe last bottom that it made, which would be moat important, -
you should vhen begin an angle at that bottom and contlnue on up again; watch
when thia angle is broken or when Time is squared out again with Price,
which would be important for another change In trend, either mijor or tinor.

Ga-23
THREE WAYS TO SQUARE [IWR AUD PRICE:
Ee eee

We can square the Renge, thet is, the number of peiuts from extrem low to
extreme high, with Time- then square the extreme low point with Tima» and square
the extreme high point with Time, When the market passes out of these squares
ond breaks important angles, the trend cheoges up er dem. ~

1 - The ronge that = stook makes betwoen extreme high ond extreme low oan de
squered #0 long as it remains in the sumo price range, If the ronge fa 25
peiate, 1t squares with 25 periodgof Time-— days, weeks or months. Continue
to usd this time peried ex long as it stays in the same range.

2 — SQUARING TIUB WITH BOTICU OR EXTREME LOW PRICE;
The next important Price to square with Tine is the lomest Price or bottom
of ony importent decline, For exeaplo; If the tettem of m stock is 25, thm
at ths ond of 25 days, 26 weeks or 25 months, Time aud Price are equal. The”
wetoh for o change in trend as based on its bottom or lowest selling price,
As long as o stook continues to held one bottom end eAvences, you can slaty:
tao this time peried running across end continuing the time period, noting -
every time it passes out of tho squares, wWateh ospecdally when the stock
rocohes the third square, the fourth square, ond again the soventh and ninth
squares of its time period, These squares only coour frequently oo the doily
or weakly charts, as tho monthly, in rost oases, would mom out of a range,
up or down, before it squared a bottom as many as 7 or 9 times, Howorer, “
thie does souetimes happen when a stock is in o narrow venge for many years.

3 — SQUARING TIKS WITH TOP GR EXTREME HIGH PRICE;
The other important point ta square Time with le the extreme high price of «
stock. The Time period must be carried noross from the high of the daily,
Weekly or wouthly, end the equarc of the top price tn Time must be noted
sod wetched for o change in trond. If the top of a eteck ia 60, then when
it has moved over 50 duys, 50 wenks or 5O months, 1¢ has reached its aquare
in Time sud en importent change is indicated. Thig can be determinad by the
Position of the angles from top ond bottom, For exemple;

Dow—Jones Industriel Aversges-= The high of $66 os Septomber 3, 1929 mould —
“require S86 ealeudar days to oquel the Price in Time, This caourred on
September 25, 1930, Lock ot the chart and note how the trend changed ond
turned down orewmd thet time, Then, om Qotober 1¢, 1981, it rum out tts
poriod ogain- and ogein Howenber ¢, 1932, Novewher 25, 1933, December 16,
1934, and January 6, 1955, Leok up these dates and you will ses that
important changes in trend ccourrad on the Daily Chart when thig time period
of 586 days balanced the price of 386, . ~
Both major and minor tops and bottons Me all time periods must bo watched as -
they aquaro out right along. Most importent of all is the extrene dteh ~
point on tho monthly high and low chart, This moy bo wory high ond work out

© long tine period before it equeres the top, in which case you hava to
divide the price into 8 equel tims periods and watch the most important _
points, liko 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 3/4, but most iuportomt of all is when Time equa
Price,

When you are watching the position of o atock after it has squared out fron—
« bottom or a top, always look up the tine poried ond the ongles from tho op-
Posite direction, If the market is nooring « low point, squering out a tep, 208
how its relationis to the bottom as it might be in the second or third square

GA-30
peri’ {rom the dottom, which would be a double indication for a change in trend.

SQUARING WEEKLY TIME PER TODS:

The year contains 52 weeks and the Square of this in Time and Price 4s 52
by 52. Therefore you can make up & square of 52 wide and S2 high; put on all
of the angles from 0"; uhen chart the weakly high and low prices of any stock
in this square, For example: If vhe tow price of a stock is SO, then the top
of this weekly square would be 52 added to 50, which makes 102 as top of the
square. As long as the stock stays above 50 and aoves up, it will be working
in the'weekly square of 82. On the other hand, if the stock makes top and works

down, you would make up 4 weekly square $2 points dom from the top and 52 over
to get the time pericd. .

You can take the past movement of any stock, pul on @ square of 52 by 52,
and study the movement, noting 13 weeks of one-fourth, 26 weeks or one-palf, and

_ 59 weeks of three-fourths points on time, and the changes in trend which cake

place when the stock reaches these tmportant Resistance Points in Time and Price,
You would watch for a change in trend aroung these vine perlods. .

SQUARING MONTHLY Thar peRTons:

Ab the Lime a stock breaks a 45° angle, if 14 le selling at 138 on the
35h month, It is breaking a doubly strong Resistance Level-- a sirong angle
and a natural Resietance Level, This would be Time and Space balancing at
Resistance Levels or geometrical angles ang would Indicate a big decline to fol-
Tow. + Revarse this rute at the end of 6 bear crmpaign. :

OA a monthly chart twelve monthe Completes a year, therefore the square of

, 12 de very important for working oul tine periods on the monthly chart. The

square of 22 is 144 and important changes often occur on even 12 months’ per Lode
from a bottom or top of a stock. Tt will help you $f you use the Resistance :
Levels on prices of the even 12's, noting 24, 36, 45, 60. 72, 84, 96, 106, ete,
Watch how the stock acte on angles when it reaches these important Resletance

; PRICE ANEAD OF Time

-_ Shy do stocks often cros@ the 45° angie on the daily, weekly or nonthiy
chart, then have an advance for a short pericd of tine, decline and rest on the
same 45° anglet Because when the stock crosses the 45° angle the first time, it
has pot run out or overcom the square of Time with Price. Therefore, onthe -
secondary reaction, when it rests on the 46° angie, it ls at a time when the

stock has reached the square of diatencs $1 Tim, afver that a greater advance
Soliows, : ;

Reverse this rule at the lop of & dul) market, When a stock breeks under
the 48° angle a long distance Crom the bage or boblom, It is mast. important,
Many vimes a stock will rest on the 45° angle in the early stages of an advance,
then lever, ona reaction, rest on it agein; then have a prolonged advance, re-
act and rest on the 45° again, and Lhen advance lo a higher level; then break
the 45° angle'the next time, which places it in an extremely weak position bee
cause it Is so far away from the base and so much time has elapsed since the

stock made low, Don’t Corgeat--It is most important when angles are broken of

After over 40 yeara of research, tasts and practical applications, I have

Por example: If fev should count across the bottom of your chart 220 spaces,

HOW TO ORAK GEOMETRICAL ANGLES

There ore three important polnte that wa con prove With mathemolics of
gvometrys the Cltele, the Square, and the ‘Trlonole. After I hove made the
Square, 1 can draw a Circle in it using the aome dicaeter, and with tha dif-
ferent Squares produce the Tricngle and the Bquare in the Circle.

Tho Angles of Roving-trand-Line overages measure ond divide “Time ond

Price inte proportionate parts. Refer to Form "4 where [C hove drava the
square 01-90, Yeu ‘wlll note that this is 90 high cad 90 wide - in other
worden, 9O up and 90 cerdsa. Il ie the same cz a square toom which has o bel-
lom or flcoer, ao top er cefilng, ond side walls. Everything hoa Width, length,

duce g triangles.

At You Look at thia Square, it should be easy for you te tekl with your
eyo where the atrongest support point it, or resistence polnt is, It ie at
tha center where all the ¢aglas arose, four angles eroes ot this point, to

{e, the a£fference between ‘tha extreme low and the extreme high prices, oF

the difference between aay Jaw point ené any high polnt, and also how to
aquare ihe bottomprice. For example: If tha top ie 90, the square of 90x
90 would ropresent aquoring the Price by Tims, because If we have 90 points

HOW TO DRAW AKGLES FROM A LOW POTHT RECORSED BY GRAJH
FIRST IMPORTANT GHNETRICAL AVGLE

The first, and olways the most impertani, angle te draw is a as° ongls or

con buy every time it rests on the 4S° angle with o stop toss order ¢, 2 or $
tenta under the 45° angle, but remomber the rule - never use o stop loss order
more than § cents away. Ualesa Grain is noar the low levels or just atarting

daces to determine whether the data showed the approach
and departure of the phenomena to which I have drawn your
attention. In order to condense the chart and reduce the
statistical burden, I rook stock prices at 10-day incervais
instead of 1-day intervals backward and forward from the
controlling dates. The controlling dates for these additional
years were obtained in the same way as in che conjunction
year. namely. by ascertaining the date of the conjunction of
the sun and Jupiter. This process yielded five charts of four
stock market curves each, all of them having one thing in
common: vertical alignment by the date of the sun’s con-
junction with Jupiter. 1 have put all five of these chars into
one grand chart for your examination, the vertical scale being
logarithmic as before. The stack price curves in each group
are plotted as departures from their own individual averages.
If you are not technically inclined, you can ignore all this
explanation and simply observe the contours of the charcs.
They are shown in che chart entitled JUPITER-SATURN
CONJUNCTION YEARS — STOCK PRICES DURING
PART OF JUPITER SYNODIC PERIOD IN FIVE YEARS
OF WHICH JUPITER-SATURN CONJUNCTION YEAR
1S CENTER { Chart 25}. This comparison shows clearly that
the situation of the conjunction year does not exist two years
before, begins to appear in the first year before the Jupiter-
Saturn conjunction, appears precisely in the year of con-
junction, partially departs in the first year after conjunction.
and vanishes in che second year after conjunction. You will
nore that the vertical range of the curves is much less — they
are claser together — in the year of conjunction than in che
two years before or che two years after the year of conjunction.
The stock price pattern in the year of conjunction is unique.
The statistical association between stock price tendencies and
the sun-Jupicer-Sacurn phenomena described is in my
estimation a meaningful association. It is a peculiar but
important event. Both relative cycles — the Jupicer-Sacurn

RULES FOR FUTURE CYCLES

Se eS

Stocks move in lO-yoar cycles, which creworked out in §-yeor cycles — 0
S-yeat cycle up ond « S-year sycle dom, Bogin with extreme tops ond extrene
bottons te figure all cycles, either major or minor...

Rule 1 - A bull compaign generally rune $ years — 2 yoors up, 1 year down, ond
2 years up, conploting a 5-yoor cycle. The ond of a S-year campaign
cones in the 59th or 60th monthe, Alwoys watch for the change in the
SSth month,

Rule 2 - 4 bear cycle often runs § years down—the firet nove 2 yeors doen, thon
1 yonr up, and 2 years down, completing the S-yeor downzving.

Rule 3 ~ Bull or bear campaigns ¢eldom run more then 3 to 3¢ yours up or down
without @ move of 3 to & months or ano yeor io the opposite dircotion,
except at the end of Major Cyoles, like 1869 and 1929, Mony compoigns
culminate in the 23rd month, not running out the full two yeors, Watch
the weekly aid monthly oharts to determing whether the culmination wil)
ocour in the 25rd, 2¢th, 27th or SOth month of the move, or in extreme
Suppaigna in the 34th to 35th or 4ket te 42ud mouth. :

Rule 4 ~ Adding 10 years to any top, it will sivo you top of the noxt iW-yoar
Cyclo, ropecting about tho camo averege fluctuntiors,

Rule 5 = Adding 10 years to any bottom, it will E470 you the bottom of the noxt

l0-yoar cyclo, repeating the same kind of a Year end about the came
avoruge, fluctuations,
2

Rule 6 - Beer campaigns often rum out in Tnyoar cyoles, or 3 yoars and ¢ years
from eny complete bottoa. From any complete bottom of a-cyole, first
edd 3 youra ta got the next bottoms then add 4 yoara to that bottom to
got bottom of Teyear cycle, For @xample: 1924 heottom = add 3 yoars,
Sives 1917, low of panic; then add ¢ years to iflT, gives 1921, low of
another depression,

Rule 7 - To any final mojor or minor top, edd 3 years ta got the next top; then :
add 5 years to thet top, which wila “ive the third top? add 4 years te
the third top te get the final top of a l0-yoer cycle. Somotimos «
ohenge in trend from ony top scours before the end of the vegular time ©
‘period, therefore you should begin to watch the 27th, Seth, end 42nd
moths for a roversal,

Rule $ — Adding § years to any top, it will Give the next’ bottom of a 5-year
eyoie. In order to get top of the noxt 5-year cycle, add 5 ycars to
any bottom, For oxemple: 1017 was bottom of a big tear campaign; ade
5 yours givos 1922, top of a minor bull cempaim. Why do E any, “Top
of @ Binor bull cempaigat™ Beoauss the major bull eampoign way dust
ond in 1929, . .

LOLS was tops adding § yoars to 1919 givoe 1924 o4 bottan os a
S-yeor bear cyole, Rofer to Rulos 1 ond 2, which tell you thet a bul?
or bear cempulen seldom rims more thon 2 to 3 yoers fo the eemo directi.:
The bear campaign from 1929 was 2 yoara down—1920 and 1921: thereforn,
mo only expoct ono-yoor rakly in 19223 then 2 yoors dowo—192$ end 1924,
which soupletens the Seyenr boar aycle,

Looking bank to 1913 ond 2914, you will see that 1925 and 1924 quit
be bear years to complete the lO-year cycle frow the bottoms of 191$-171-

Then, note 1917 bottom of on bear yonr} adding 7 yoora cives 192¢ u-

a2 bottom of o bear cycle. Them, adding $ yoars to 1924 gives 19
top of a cyole,

FORECASTING MONTHLY MOVES
FORECASTING MONTHLY MOVES
Monthly moves can be deterained by the same rules os yearly;

Add three months to on important bottom, then odd 4, moking 7, to get minor
bottoms and reaction points, ”

Tn big upswings a reaction will often not lest over tro months, the third wr
being up, the namo rule as in yearly cycle=-2 dow and the third We =

In extreme markets, a reaction sonetines only lasts2 or 3 weeks; then the a.

veno is resumed, In this wey a merket may continues up for 12 months wit}
out breaking « wonthly bottom,

in a bull market the minor trond may reverse ond run down 3 to 4 wonthay thet
turn up and follow the mein trend again, _

Tn « bear market, the minor trend aay run up 3 to ¢ months, then reverse and
follow the main trend, altho, as o general rule, stocks never relly nore
2 montha in a boar market; then start to break in the 3rd month and fol) -
the main trend down.

.

FORECASTING WEEKLY MOVES

Tho weekly wovemmt gives the next dmportent minor change in trend, which TA}
turn out to be a major chenge in trend, >

In a buld market, o stock will often rim don 2 to $ wooks, end possibly 4, t
reverse and follow the main trend ogain,g As 4 rule, the trend will turn upt
the middle of the third week end close higher at tho ond of the third week, :
stock only moving 3 weeks agsinat tho main trend, In some cases the change |
trend will act cccur mmtil the fourth woek; then the reversal will cone and t
stock close higher at tho ond of the fourth week.

Reverze thia rule io « dear market,

Tn rapid morkote with big voliso, © move will often mm 6 to 7 weeks before—
minor roversel in trend, ond in some ceses, like 1929, these fast motos kos
to 18 woeke or 1/4 of @ yoer.s These aro culmination moves up or dom.

As there are 7 days in a week and sovan times seven equale 49 doys or 7
wooks, this ofton marks an importent ‘turning point. Thorefore you should w.
for top or bottom around the 49th to S2nd dey, altho ot timos o chongo will .

on the 42nd to 46th doy, boceuso a poriod of 45 days is 1/8 of 0 yoar, Also -
for culminotions at the end of 90 ta 98 days. 7”

After ¢ markot has doolinod 7 weoks, it may havo 2 or 3 short wooks on tho oi:

ond than turn up, which agroos with the monthty rule for a change in the thin
month,

Always watoh tho annual trond of no stook and oonsider whethor it is in o bull

F-S

beer year, In a bul) your, with the monthly chart showing up, thoro sro many
tines that a stook will react 2 or 3 weeks, then rest 3 or ¢ weeks, ant then co
Ante new territory and advance 6 to 7 weeks more.

After a stook makes top and reacts 2 to 3 weeks, it may then heve a yally of 2

_. several weeks without crossing the highest tep or breaking the lawost week of

that rengo. In cases of this kind, you cen buy toar the low point or sotl near
the high point of that range and protect with a stop less order 1 to 3 points
axay. However, » better plan would be to wait until the stock shows « definite
trend before buying or seltings then buy the stook whon it crosses the highest
point or well when it breaks the lowest point of that trading range.

The above charts show a Fourter derived composite cycle of
the 64, 71, 10 and 5 week market cycles for. che 1976-1979 period.
The £4 of tha composite to the eccuel market is not, of course,

perfect, bur many of. che-actusl high and low points were vell def-~
tinea by way of chis cyclical procedure.

On page 7, I nave dravn.in a mddel composite 24-veek cycle
based upon the 24-week, Seweek, 4-veek) 2-week and oneeweek market
cycles, You tan use this composite: as an approximate road map for

intermediate market cycles within .a neutral period of the aajor
trend.

SKEWING:

The rendition on page 7 presumes that all of the cycles are
equal in amplitude during rising and falling market periods end
that chey are equah in the lengchs of cheir rising and declining
phasos., This is noc in actuality che case. Stocks spend abouc
2/3 of the-time rising and mejor bull phases show a Tlaing cycle
for about 2/3 of the 4-year mejor cyclical period. We siso find
thac intermediate cycles show a rising skew during bull markets.
Shore term cycles show rising chews during Tising incermediace per-
iods. Cycles are very influenced by che positions of cycles sdove
them in length.

Te is a sign of market “gtrengch vhen cysles show greater per-
fods of rising chan falling ocrivity and a sign of market veekneca
when cycies show longer periods of decline in cheir phases. During
Reucral market periods, cycles tend to rise and falt for equal cine
spang -- often with great precision.

You may netcice in the rendition on poge 7 how the overall cyc-
lical direction in cet by the Z4-week intermediate cycle. Shorter

Astronomical Cycles

“STPONHY is more concerned with cycles

than any of the other aciences. For

“exemple, the earth and the other
planets go around the sun in cyelas, The
moons go around the planets in cycles. The
Planets and their moone revolve sround
Shair own exes in cycles, end, for that
matter, the sun revolves acound its own
axiz toa, pots come and go in cycles,
Comats hares their cycles. The Jight from
meny of the atara pulastes in cyclea. Even
the whole galaxy of which cur soler system

To make’ the difference between sidereel

« few lines from the same back,

To make the case simpla Suppose we
think of the planste in their orbits of
different sizes ali starting Cogether on
the same line for a race ercond the sun. A
person at the sun would see all the planets
in line toward some certéin star, .

“Each time « planet would complate x

some distance to go to overtake one of the
slower moving outer planeta 20 us to bring
planer, eacth, and san agaia inte one Line,

ben this happens, that planet has com
pleted one of its synodic periods. The
word aynodic is fram a work aignify-
ing a ‘meeting.’ From one teeting of earth

Pd planet to the next is a synodig period,

the "maating’ period.”

Tn the table om the fotlowing page
Johnson has extended the meaning of the
term fynedic to include the “ meeting” of
any tro of the planate,

Thus when Johnson says thet the aynodic
period of Mercury and Venus is 44,5 days

means ther if Mercury and Venus and the
aun were lined up so thet a sttaight line
drawn through the canter of the aun would
pass through the center of each {a halic-~
Centric conjunction}, it would be 344.5
days before these two Planets would again
Get in line with each other and the sun
to create @ second heliocentric con-
junction,

Thee fs, if Mercury aud Venus were
Pacing, at the stare of the race, with
Mercury ot the pail, the faster moving
Mercury would poll ehead of Venus and make
one complete lap in its sidereal period of
8B days, Lut in the meantime Venus would
have gone ahead only 98/225 of a revolution.
For Kercury to catch up would take 56%
days more, or 144.5 days in ail. This in-
tarvel is what Jobnson would call che
Bynodic period of Mercury and Venue.

phase (18 years total ).

Phase Tre : This is the shortest of he three phases of the 37 year cycle. This phase hits its bigh 5
years from ii's ptart. J makes [I's ultimate low point 7 years from the start. This pattern calls for a 5
year Bull move, waich consists of trro up legs with one intervening Bear markel or sideways market,
From this five year high, an approximate two year Bear market or sideways market begins. (7 years

Phase Three : This is tle final phase of the 37 year cycte. The time span from the beginning of this

PART 5
THE GODS

Caarren 17
AGES AND CYCLES OF TIME

The ages given in ancient literature were calculated from the travels of
the sun and earth in the heaven, It is written thet God (the sun) regulates
time into days, seasons, years and agés according to his wisdom and thet his
Jaws are unchangeable. The dividing of time into years and seatons is a well
known science, but the making of time into ages is not understood, Ih simply
means the same as making days into months and seesons, and « given number
of years into ages,

Before the beginning of the historic era (1S00 B.C.}, the center of popu-
lation and civilization was in Asia and Africa. From the ruins found on these
continents it has been learned that all years and ages were calculated in
zodiacal degrees. In the tombs and in the different temples are found in-
scriptions conteining the signs of the zodiac, showing the signs to represent
the eges, The ancient zodiac and calendars, which have been preserved,
begin the year with the constellation of the Bull (Taurus). The zodiec known
ag the Eelephanta Pagoda (Sallsette) has the sign of the sacred Bull (the
ox Apis}, e¢ the first ruler of the twelve constellations. The ceiling of a
sepulchral chamber et Thebes shows the Bull as the rst month of the suramet
season, The zodiac of Esne, the astronomical picture discovered in the Rem-
messeur of Thebes, illustrates the Bull to be the leading eign of the age,
calcufated from the time when the Vernal equinox pasted through the
Hyades, located in the head of the Bull. The Chinese have referred to
beginning of the cycles for the aun and stars to Taurus and Chinese reco:
relate the Pleindes as marking the beginning of time. Hesoid sings of
Pleiades aa beginning the labora of the year and the Roman myths refer t
them, in connection with the Virgilie, ax the time for the beginning of th
cycle.

The Egyptian title of “Pharaohs” and “Dynasties” wes applied to whet
the Hebrew race called “Logos” and the ages of the “Patriarch.” In the
different eges nemes of men and wowen were given to the cycles, or dynasties
to record history in ages, The agea were calculated from the moving of the
equinactial points, within the twelve signs of the rodiac, in 28, 80 and 32
degree cycles of 72 years to each degree. In all ages of the past, and by all
races up lo the present time, the system described in dividing the cycles of
each sign of the rodiec into minor divisions hes been used.

We take it for granted that the Christian Age simply represents a cycle
of time, and thal this age corresponds to the dynasties and patriarchal ages.
The system used to divide ages into smaller cycles is very simple. The greet

Fer

ao

126 Ancient PaguisTonic Wispom

cycle of our solar system contains 25,920 years of 360 degrees each, which
mekes 72 years to each degree, or dey, We next divide 25,920 into twelve
ages, which equals 2,160 degrees of 72 years cach. The cycle of 2,260 is
divided into. 30 days and equels 72 degrees to each dey, which is a very
common system and easily understood,

The Bible contains the statement that at the time of the end, called the
judgment day (Doomsday), the world would be destroyed, and we now
realize that the end of the world means the end of an age, but not the end
of time. The universe is operated in cycles, whereby the minor ages repeat
itself into periods of time. Nature gives the best illustration of what an age
is and how long it laste, as it may he a day, season, year, or thousands of
years.

The sun appears to rise in the east end goes over the meridian at noon,
and disappears in the west to reappeur again as & new cycle the following
day. An age or a period of time is calculated by the same system, and in
a3 meny hours divided into minor divisions as the sun's cycle is divided
within the 24 hours of its circuit, A year is divided into seasons, and the
condition the sun produces on the earth ‘is according 10 the formation, revo-
lution and location of the sun. Nature provides that at the end of cach year
a destruction tekes place and we call ft fall or autumn. It is so also, with the
agea of the earth, the sun and man, and nature gives signs and waminga of
the epprosch of the termination of the ages, The Bible shows that the most
common memes among the Jewish people were used to describe days, years
and cycles, When an age was described in the name of a man, his children
end grandchildren represented the smaller cycles in ihe same sense as
minutes and seconds do to the hours of time. “A year is as a day and a day
as 4 thousand years with the Lord,” which means, that an age is calculeted
from the eun and is complete whether it is an hour, day or year and that all
are calculated by the same method.

In order 10 get to the fundamental principle of this study, we will state
that there {a no difference between degrees and hours, representing space and
time. A circle contains 360 degrees for both space and tims, and is the basic
- principle to calculate from, There ere 60 seconds in one minute and 60
Tainutes in one hour, meking 360 seconds in # cycle. There are 60 minutes
in one hour and 12 hours makes 720 minutes for one day and 1,440 minutes
in 24 bours, The 12 hours of a day correspond to the 12 signe of the zodiac,
which contein 30 degrees each, making 860 for 12 signs end 720
degrees to equal 24 hours, or one month of 30 All time end space
are calculated as containing 360 degrees in 12 hours, which hes to be con:
sidered when dividing « dey of 24 hours into space.

Time end space are calculated from the earth’s divrnal rotation on its
axis in 24 hours and frou: its revolution around the sun in one year. The
ectiptic circumference of the earth is 25,920 miles and as the earth revolves
on its axis in 24 hours, the rate of motion, therefore, fs 1,080 miles per hour.
We divide the 1,080 miles per hour into minutes in dividing it by 60, and
the rate of the carth’s rotation on its exis will be 18 miles per minute. The

.
ACES and CycLes or TmE 127

earth makes ita circuit around the sun in one year, which corresponds to 24
hours and to 25,920 degrees, at the seme rate of motion es it rotates on its
axis, From this it will be seen that the earth rotates on its axis at the rate of
18 miles per minute and thet il travels through space, around the sun, at the
rate of 18 miles per minute, which makes the earth's actual motion 36 miles
per minule, Astronomers celculate that our solar system travels at the rate
of 18 miles per second, We state that the motion of the sun and carth, among
the stars, is 86 miles per minute, making 2,160 miles per hour, 25,920 miles
in 12 hours and 51,40 miles in 24 hours, which makes the motion of the
earth 72 milea per usinute, without adding the motion of the poler fall.

A quarter circle is called one week and contains one fourth of 24 hours,
which is six days or degrees. Let it be distinctly understood that one of God's
quarter divisions, called a week, contains six deya, or degrees end corres
ponds to « quarter of the daily circuit of 24 hours, A day is ag one hour and
conteins 60 degrees, therefore, making six days contain 360 degrees; 12 daya
720 degrees; 24 days 1,440 degrees; and 30 days 1,800 degrees, hours or
minutes. A month of 30 days is to 22 hours, es a day of 60 degrees is to
15 hours, which makes 15 degrees to one hour or distance, A year of 12
months of 80 degrees each contains 360 degrees and is to the distance sround
the earth, es 24 hours is to a day, and ajso as a month of 30 degrees is to
24 hours. From this it will be seen that 90 is to 360 a9 6 fs to 24, and
represents one fourth of apace and tirae.

It is writen that in the beginning God created the world in siz days,
which means that dhe first six degrees represent 90 degrees in space from the
beginning, or Vernal equinox. A solar year contains 360 degrees (within
twelve months), therefore meking six months contain 180 days and thres
months 90 days, which again represent degrees of longitude. There are 24
hours in a day and 30 deya makes 720 hours, which are divided into deacana
by three and equal 240 hours to each deacan of 10 degrees, making 8 hours
to ane deacan. ,

The clrewmference of the earth contains 25,920 miles and es the earth
revolves on its exis in 24 hours, the motion of the earth ia 1,080 miles per
hour. The motion of the carth in 25,920 miles is divided into 12 hours, or
taonths and equals 2,160 miles, which ia again divided into 30 days and
equals 72 mites to each degree. One hour, or day equals 72 miles; 10 houre
720 miles; 30 hours 2,160 miles; and 12 hours, or months contain 25,920
hours, miles, or degrees. One revolution of the carth ix called & generation
in the Bible, and is calculated from the polar moridian degree until it returns
to the same meridian agrin in precession.

God, the sun, a8 father time, created the heaven and the earth in six days
and on the seventh day rested, from which we learn that time is divided into
six and seven days. It does not say, in the story ebout creation, that a day
contains any given number of hours, but that time is divided into day and
night, which is egain described as divided into seven and five tribes,

A week of six days represents six signs, or hours, and « week of seven
days contains seven signs, or hours, A week of seven days, months, or seasons

.
128 Ancient Prentsrouc Wispom

consist of the seven months from the Vernal equinox lo the Autumn equinox,
which is from February 19th to September 23rd. A day and the summer
season contain seven hours and months; the nights and the winter season
contsin five hours and months. The seven months of surmmer have also been
described and calculated from the Bull sign, in April, to the Scorpion in
November, and the winter months from November lo April. (See plate 6).

A week of six days, or hours, begins at twelve o'clock and extends to
six o'clock, which correspond to the space from the first degree Pisces to
Virgo, and if calculated for seven days, it includes Virgo as the seventh day,
or sign. The second week is calculated from six o'clock to mwelve o'clock
and contains the Southern six signs from August to February. It will be seen
that a week of six days contains xix signe and that a week of seven days,
seven signs, making nineleen precessional weeks terminate the age,

The six day week when applied to the signs of the zodiac and to the
twelve hours of the dey is in the following order; Monday is the first dey of
the week and corresponds to the sign Pisces and the hour between 12 and 1
o'clock. Tuesday corresponds to the time between ] and 2 o'clock in Aries;
Wednesday to the time between 2 and 3 o'clock in Taurus; Thursday to the
hour between 3 and 4 o’clock in Gemini; Friday to the hour between 4 and
§ o'clock in Cancer; Saturday to the hour between 5 and 6 o'clock in Leo.
The second six day week begins with Monday in Virgo and corresponds to
the hour between 6 and 7 o'clock; Tuesday to between 7 and 8 o'clock in
Libra; Wednesday to between 8 and 9 o'clock in Scorpio; Thursday to
between 9 and 10 o'clock in Sagitarius; Friday to between 10 and 11 o’elock
in Capricorn; Saturday to between 1] and 12 o’clock in Aquartus.,

It will be observed that the opposite hours and days of the signs, repre-
sent the same day in the week, in both the Norther and Southern Hemi-
sphere. This is best understood by the signs of Cancer and Capricorn for
Jume and December, which represents Friday, In ancient writings Fridey
was given as hangman's dey and the day when timo of all description is
kilted. Time is killed on the cross formed by the solstices and the equator.
The sum is furthest north and south of the equator in June and December
tespectively, which forms a cross with the equator, meking the carth’s four
cardinal points, on which time is crucified. The earth remains stationary
about three days, when it reaches its furthest points north and south. It has
been referred to that the age was dead and buried for three days and when
this was applied to the weeks, it is described to take place from Friday to
Sunday. It now becomes evident that one week contains aix hours, days,
months, or years, Two weeks correspond to twelve hours and four weeks of
six days cach to twenty-four hours. Six daye, or hours of 60 minutes to the
hour, makes 360 minutes, which corresponds to hours and days. Two weeks
of 12 hours, make 720 minutes and four weeks or 24 hours 1,440 minutes,
or degrees, thus representing #n age.

Six days of six hours each, correspond to 36 degrees, twelve days of siz
hours to 72 degrees, and twenty-four days represent 144 degrees. Six hours,
days, or a week of six days, correspond to 36 degrees or one-tenth of the

Aces anp CycLes oF TLME 129

cyele of $60, which mekes 36 one-tenth of all calculations. A year of 360
degreca wag divided into twelve months of 30 days each, A cycle of 360
degrees was alse divided into ten hours, days and months of 36 deys exch,
making five days equal 180 degrees, or hours, From this it will be seen
what the will of Father Time means, and that his laws are unchengeable.
Ie is written that God creates ond destroys according to his will, which can
be readily seen from the motion of the earth. A day ix a3 a year and repre:
sents a generation, which describes what is meant by the beginning and end-
ing of the different generetions. A day of creation begins at sunrise in the
morning and terminates at sunset, which meano that the day ia destroyed
when night comes on, The seasons of the year end ages are destroyed when
Father Time changes the seasons and years according to hin well.

The past age described in the Bible contained 32 yeara, and fs given in
the house of Pisces in the name of Jesus. This age terminated in the destruc-
tion of the Christian Age, when the North Magnetic Pole passed the solar
meridian at the 96th degree west longitude, in the year 1920 AD. From this
we may learn that the age of Jesus, containing 82 years, represents 60
degree? in space os an age.

One of the comparative ages described in the Bible contain $5,924 yeara,
which have been so divided that 4,004 years ure termed B.C. and 1920 A.D.,
up to the time of the crucifying of Christ, which terminates the age, The
cycle deseribed after the age of Jesus, is in the naroe of the Aponte St. Paul,
containing 84 years. This age is divided into three cycles, or taontha of 28
years each, and represents the polar distance from the $6th degree west
longitude te the 180th meridian. -

B.C.—-AD. AND AM.—PM,

‘The dividing point between B.C. and ALD. corresponds to 12 o'clock noon
(the sero degree and the Vernal equinox), which means the zero meridian
degree. It corresponds to our present method of using A.M. for the forenoon
hours and P.M. for the afternoon hours. The term B.C. means before sero
and A.D, after date. When time is described as B.C. it was counted back:
ward from zero, or 12 o'clock, end means that the time is lacking #0 many
minutes, yeara, or degrees before reaching zero time, If the age is given at
60 B.C. it corresponds to ten o’dlock, because it is 60 degrees before 12
o’ctock. The term 60 B.C, when applied to the distences in the heaven and
iso on the earth in degrees, means 60 degrees east, or before the zero and
first meridian degree. .

called spring, or vernal equinox, and the fell, or autumn equinox, which
jo caloulated from the frst and seventh meridians and the Gms when the
sun enters the first degree of Aries and Libra every year. The zero meridian
equinox takes place about February Toh; the Autumn equinox about
Septerober 23rd; and when this method is applied to the hours of elock time,
it corrasponds lo 12 and 7 o'clock. It now heoomes evident that the Zero
degree and vernal equinox represent 12 o'clock and February 19th as well
as the north polar degree for a day, year, and all cycles of time; and that

.

130 Axcient Prentsronic Wispow

the precession of the equinoxes are calculated from both the Zero degree
and the first meridian.

The principle of describing the meridian degree, for the carth, is from
the sun’s motion in the 12 signs of the zodiec, The sun rises in the cast,
which corresponds to AM, or B.C, and reaches the meridian at 12 o'clock,
end then sets in the west, which again corresponds to P.M. or AD. From
this we learn that the signs of the zodiac from Virgo to Pisces, represent A.M.
and forencons in the eax, and from Aries to Virgo the afternoons ¢s P.M. in
the west.

The 12 signs of the zodiac must be located on earth as they are in the
heaven, for the reason that the rotation end revolution of the earth corres-
ponds to the motion of the sun, It has been proven that when the sun enters
Aries on March 2lst, it correaponds to what is known as the Greenwich meti-
dian, which crosses England and France in tongitude. From this degree the
signs and houra can be calculated westward around the earth, in 30 degree
periods, to correspond to 360 degrees, The Zero meridian degree on earth
corresponda to 30 degrees in longitude east of the Greenwich degree, which
crosses Alexandria, Egypt, and Leningrad, Russia, This meridian represents
the Vernal equinox, or 12 o'clock on earth, and the first degree of Pisces in
the beaven. It is en old saying that the pyramids are Tocated in the center
of the [and surface of the earth, and that ft is the place where the East meets
the West, It ts evident that it was known anciently where the Zero meridian
was located, and that the pyramids were purposely built at this locality.

In order to describe the location on earth in degrees, which corresponds
lo the ages of ancient time, we will describe the location of the -year and
degree of 600 B.C. to show the system used. The year 600 B.C. is given in
nearty all anclent records as the termination of an age and the beginning of
anew cycle, The story about Nosh and the flood is given a9 having taken
place at his 600th year, and this age corresponds to the beginning of all
Asiatic religions, from Confuctus to Buddha, Nebuchedneszar, Solon and
many others. The method employed, to locate places on carth, is the same as
used to locate polarities in the heaven. We can say thet 720 represents the
first meridian and that it crosses England in longitude, and as 600 B.C. is

_ 120 degrees before ot less than 720 degrees, we deduct 120 degrees east from
Englend, and we find this location to be on the East Const of Asia. This
corresponds to the sign of the zodiec of Sagiturics and R.A. 270, or 9
o'clock, From this it will be seen that Sagittarius is located on the East
Coast of China, and thet the heginning of's day, or x year, is at sunrise, when
the sup rises above the horizon in the East and in Sagittarius.

In order to show that the ancients described the lew and thet the yeat 600
ia the ectual termination of « cycle, we will copy the days and houre which
describe this caloulation scientifically. If we teke the lunar month to be 29
deys, 12 hours, 44 minutes und 3 seconds, we find that 219,146% days, make

_ 7,421 Vana months and thet thia number of deys gives 600 solar years, each
containing 365 days, S hours, 5I minutes, 31 seconds, As this is nearly the
same,caloulation as used at the present time, it will be sean that the ancient

Aces and CYcLes op TIME 131

Bible writers and astronomers knew the low, but used « different method of
reaching their conclusions.

In all the sacred books of the Asiatic races, as wei] as the Bible, the year
600 B.C. is given as the beginning of their historic records, as an age, We
have explained elsewhere thet the first meridian degree represents the poles
and the 720th degree. as 600 B.C. means 120 degrees east of Greenwich
and the beginning of Sugitterlus. This location ix on the East Coast of Ase
and represents the place and hour of one-third of the earth's polar fall of
32 degrees and is « turning point. It represents the beginning of « day con
taining seven signs or hours, which is from November 22nd to June 21st;
and frov 9 A.M, to 4. P.M., and means # day of 7 hours of 360 seconds, con-
taining 2.520 seconds, or degrees to the age. The beginning is 600 B.C, and
if we add 1.920 A.D, we obtein 2,590 veats, From thie it will be seen that
the axe which bezan at 600 B.C, terminated In the veer 1.920 A.D, and is
the termination of a cycte of seven generations of 2,520 years.

We have referred to the fact that cvcles of time were called by the name
of man to represent eges, which we will explain, The days of the week and
tnonths of the vear, are given individual names and represent cycles or aes.
The day of Wetnesdav is named after the Norse God Odin, or Woodin;
Phursdaw after Thor; Friday after Freiva; Saturday efter Kronos (Setur),
and Sunday after the sun. Tt simnly means to give names to distingwish one
from the other, whether it is a day, year, or age.

We have described in deteil that the ages xiven in the Bible ere calculated
frow) 4006 B.C., and that the est ace termineted in the year 2920 A.D..
after a period of 5,924 vears, The Bible slso contains a description that the
period of time. from Adam to the end of the age. contelned 6,048 years, and
that af ages terminated in the year 1920 A.D. Christian Bible students have
calevlated the time described as the creation and beginning of time, in the
Garden of Eden, to October Ist, 4004 B.C.. and thet the age of 6,048 years
terminated September 20th, 1920 AD. The two anes of 5.924 and 6.048
years each, simmby represent ovcles, which were calculated from the earth’s
polar motion. The two ages do not represent the described creation of the
earth, but the besinning of time as an age: the termination of me ia not the
destruction of the earth, but the ending of the age.

The ancients caloulated time and ages from the earth’s motion around the
sun. as already deseribed, It is written that all ages begin, or as it also ix
called resurrected, four days, or years ofter the termination of the previous
ane, Bible history dates from 4004 B.C. ; the Christion Ace began at 4 B.C,
but fs calculated from 1 A.D. and terminated in 1920, The Millennium Age
hegan in 1921, but is calculated from 1925, making the four years referred
to, which i¢ added to the age, This can best be understood from the changing
of the earth's polar motion in December every yer. The beginning of the
ace takes plece when the earth enters the sign of Cepricom on December
2st, but the Christian Age is described from midnight December 25th, and
that representa the four days which is comparatively described from 4 B.C.
to 1 A.D. It is these four days as years, when epplied to the present ae,

which corresponds to from the year 192) to 1925, when the Millennium
ectualty begins.

The name for the day of rest, or Sabbath, is derived from the fact that
at every seventh hour, day, year and age, the eerth’s poler motion becomes
stationary, which cen readily be understood from the motion of the moon
and the tides in the ocean. The day of rest is called the Lord’s, or sun’s day,
and in B.C, time calculeted from the new and full moon, This mokes the
four querter periads of the moon’s time identical to four weeks and to the
four tides at which time the motion of the sun, earth, moon and the tides
becomes stationary. The sun's day when God reats, therefore, corresponds
lo the thoe when the sun and all polar motion, including the tides, becomes
stationary, that is et rest. It is this period of rest which was cailed the
Sabbath day in ancient time,

We will mention here, that there is a disagreement regarding the location
of the Vernat equinox in the-celestiel heaven, when this degree ia located
from the zodiac. There are estronomers who claim thet the Vernal equinox
was on the 18th degree of Pisces in the year 1896, and others oleim that il
entered Aquarius in 1883. We state that the sun’s vernal equinox passed
over the very point of the Zero meridian ia the year 1920, es we have earned
from the description given in the Bible that this ia the year when the change
in ages tnkea place. The Millennium, or Aquarian Age begins when the
Verne] equinox passes from Pisces and enters Aquerius. The Bible and other
books contain descriptions of the change in the ages. It stetes thet the termi-
nation of the Christian Age is the time when the Millennium Age begins. If
astronomers are correct, the Millennium Age, consequently, will not begin
before 1,200 years in the future, The Bible, however, declares that the
‘Millennium Age begins at the termination of the Christian Age. It is given
for the time when the old heaven and earth are destroyed, after which time
a new beeven and earth are to he created. We base all of our astronomical
calculations, regarding ages, from the description given in the Bible, and
heve found it necessary, in severel instances, to differ with the present method
of astronomical cebculations, We are informed that astronomers heve been
unable to outline the location of the sign of Pisces, and it is, therefore, pos
sible that a mistake has been made. Jt is also possible thet astronomors in
1896 located the Vernal equinox from the first meridian and caleuleted space
from the Zero meridian on the codiac. It is evident thet a change in polarity
took place in the year 1920, and that this polar motion caused the termina:
Vion of the Christian Age, and also that 1925 is the time for the beginning of
the Millenium Age.

_ Europe is in the Bible described by the name of “Egypt” and the location
of Europe corresponds to the time between the zero and first meridian in the
sign of Pisces, In the description of this age, we are told thet the people
fled into Egypt for safety, as the destroyer could not kill enyone there. The
reason that Europe is described as @ safety zone is that its location corze+
ponds 10 time between twelve end one o'clock. Time is destroyed at twelve
o'clock and the beginning of time ia calculated from one o'clock, which

AGES aNd CrcLes OF Time 133

raakes this space and locality exempt from the killing by Pharaoh, the father
and destroyer of Lime,

The story thet Moses killed an Egyptian in the 15th century B.C., repre-
sens the destruction of Europe at the time, Moses is described aa having led
the populetion of Egypt out of bondage into the promised lend. He led the
children of Israe? across the Atlantic Ocean, described as the Red Sea, and
over the flooded wilderness of the eastern part of the present location of
the United Stetes. He brought the chifdren of Israel to the promised tend,
at the 120th degree west longitude, and died az an age on the mountein when
he was 120 yearn of age.

When it is realized thet Europe was called “Egypt,” and that it was
flooded at the same time the eastern part of the United States was under
water, the resson for the emigration described in the name of Moses will then
be understood. In this gradual flooding of the lowlands of Europe the popu-
lation continued to emigrate to America and the trouble described by Moses
in the wilderness represents the rising water. It states that the people com-
plained to Moses, saying that they might as well have stayed in Egypt and
died there, as 10 come to this wilderness, but they finelly arrived at the
mountain of the promised lend,

The Books of Moses describe the law, given to the children of Israel in
the mountains of what is now known as the Pacific Const States, and this
locality is the only place on earth, where the Jaw ia written in the formation
of the country, because the law of Moses and the locating of the tribes
described, contains the astronomical law, The tribes named represent the
twelve signs of the zodiac, and the rediscovery and understanding of this
mystery ctn only be solved by someone who knows the law and the forma-
tion of the Pacific Coast States.

The following periods represent ages, which have been calculated by
Bible students and are supposed to be correct. The first age described in the
Bible is from Adam to the termination of the flood and consists of 1,656
years. The second age is known as the covenant to Abrabam and consists of
427 year. The period of the Exodus contains 480 years. The time in the
wilderness representa 40 years and the division of the land by Joshua 6 years,
The ages of the Judges consist of 450 years and that of the Kings 513 years,
The time of Desolation is given as 70 years and from this time to 1 A.D.
536 years. The Hebrew Bible describes an age of 4,128 yeara, The Christian
Age contains 1,920 years and all these agea, as years, added together consist
of 6,048 years. From this it will be seen that this age of 6,048 years ter-
minated in 1920 A.D., which is the time described as the end of the world,
when Jeaus would return to earth and establish his Kingdom for another age
of, one thousand years. ;

The ancient Sacred Books of the Hindu Aryans, now preserved in India,
relates history in cycles, and called the ages “yuga” and “kelpa.” A yuga
is given. ax containing 432,000 years. The great cycle of 518,400 years
divided into 12 yuga equals 432,000 years of 72 periods of 6, 60 and 600
\o a minor yoge. From this it will be seen the Hindu-Brehmens also em-

.

134 Ancient Prearstonic Wispows

ployed the zodiacal system of the Egyplisns to describe history in ages.

The four ages- referred to in ancient writings as the Gold, Silver, Bronze,
or Brass and Tron Ages, correspond to the four seasons of the year and
to the four periods of a day of 6 hours cach, as well as to the dividing of
hours, rainutes and seconds into four periods of 15 minutes and seconds to
each querter division. The earth’s age of 6,000 years ia divided into four
periods of 1,500 years each and corresponds to the dividing of aa hour into
quartera of 15 minutes. These four ages also correspund to the four tides in
the ocean of six hours each, and to the four periods of 90 degrees each of
the circle of 360, All divisions are calculated by the same method and
corresponds to the moon’s circuit of four weeks, which begins when the moon
crosses the equator going north as the Golden Age and terminates with the
Tron Age as the fourth week.

The Iron Age begins on December 21et; the Golden on March 21st;
the Silver on June 21st; and the Brass, or Bronze on September 21st every
year, The 24 hours of the day are divided into four six hour ages, in the
following order. The iron period begins at midnight; the golden represents
the forenoon; the silver the afternoon end the brass the evening hours uatil

The Christian Age contained 1,920 years, which made the four ages con-
tain 480 years each, but as the spiritual and philosophical religion will con-
tinue 84 yeara in the future, it mekes the age contain 2,004 years. Bible
history contains a description of 6,000 yesrs, divided into four ages of 1,500
years onch, and alao into twelve ages of 500 years to each age, The birth of
the Christien Age took place on Christmas, December 24th, which corres-
ponds to the beginning of the Iron Age containing 500 years, The Golden
Age extends between the years 500 to 1000 A.D. The Silver Age terminated
at 1,500 A.D., and the Bronze, or Brass Age, which fa the present age, will
terminate in 2004 A.D, The termination of the Iron Age in 2504 A.D. cor
responds to the ending of the year at midwinter, In December, when 6 new
year is born again. :

The age containing 6,000 years is « quarter of the sun’s cycle of 24,000
yeare, which is again a quarter of 96,000 years. There are six ages of 96,000
yeare, making $76,000 years, which is lo the solar system @s 2/3 is to the
earth. The 576,000 year age is divided into quarters of 144,000 years to
each quarter, and corresponds to the distance of 240 degrees on earth. There
are six ages of 144,000 years, making 864,000 years of 120 degrees, or years,
and a8 864,000 represents one-third of an age, a complete age will, therefore,
contain 2,592,000 years, The circumference of the sun conteins 2,592,000

miles.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES

.. The Bible says “There is a time for everything." Alt
the laws of Nature teach this. There is a time to. sow and
atime to reap. The four seasons of the year teach us that
there is 2 reaping time and a sowing time, and that we can not
reverse this order of Nature’s laws. Man does not try to
grow oranges on Greenland’s icy mountains; neither does he
expect to cut ice from the tropical rivers in Florida, because
it is out of season, time, and place. It is the same with the
stock market. There is a time to buy and a time to sell, and
when this time comes, neither bunches of bears nor bevys of
bulls with hot air, hope, optimism, extreme pessimism, de-
pression or bad reports, can force prices above or below the
zones of Supply and Demand, out of season. You must learn
to go with the tide, and not against it. Discern the signs of
the times, and do not get caught in the undertow when the
tide is flowing out. Those who hesitate and are late in

buying or selling in the last stage invariably have to take
losses,

THE ANCANA or STOCK AMD SHARE KEY BY SEPWARIAL

The RADIX of any company is the noon of the date and
place of registration of that Company, whereby, under
the laws of the country the promotors are given powers

to form the company and proceed with business.

The RADIX of a Stock Exchange IS THE NOON OF THE DATE.
OF FOUNDING, ‘The charts for New York and London are
altachtd hereto and will serve as examples of all others,
FROM THIS RADIX or root Eigure of the heavens a variety
of influences are by natural process of celestrial mo-
tions indicated. These are found to depend altogether
upen the Sun, which is the controlling center of their
interactions. The Sun's MAN MOTION 15 59 minutes and
eight seconds per day. The measure of TIME IS ONE DAY
FOR A YEAR. Thus the influences arising out of the move~_
ment of the bodies in relation to the Sun will influence
successive years of the Company, the indications arising
in the second day affecting the second year, those form-
ed on the third day influence the third year, and so on

continuously.

SOLAR MOTION: THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE SUN AS SEEN
FROM THE EARTH is shightly variable, according to the
season of the year. This is due to the fact that the

apparent orbit of the Sun is not concentric with the

.

te

earth but ws Slightly removed Uherefrom, thus producin:

uh ercentrigity ol its apparent maqion about the carth,

and this may amount to as tiuch aS one degree and fifty

six minutes either way, as compared with its mean, or
average motion, which is 59 minutes 8 seconds per day. It
has been found in a great number of tests that the MEAN hO-
TION OF THN SUN IS THE CORRECT MEASURE TO BE OBSERVED, AND
4 SUN RIQUIRES 365 1/4 days to complete the circle of
360 degrees we have a mean motion of 59 minutes 8 seconds
per day.

This amount is multiplied by the number of years from
the radix or date of registration and added to the Sun‘s
place in the radix (called Sun +), also to the Midheaven,
and to the Moon r. The other planets are in the same way
carried. forward through the zodiac at the same rate as the
Sun and maintain their radical relations with the Sun there-
by, but in the course of their progress from day to day at
this uniform rate, they form aspects to the radical places
of the Sun, Midheaven, Moon, and ascendant of the radix.
These aspects are called DIRECTIONAL ASPECTS and they I~
FLUENCE THE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY OR TRE BUSINESS OF ANY
EXCHANGE ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL NATURES.

TRE PRIME SIGNIFICATOR OF ANY CHART IS THAT PLANET
WHICH RULES TNE SIGN IN WHICH THE SUN IS FOUND. Thus,
in the chart Cor the New York Stock bxchange, the Sun
is in the sign Taurus. This sign is ruled by Venus, and

Venus therefore becomes PRIME SIGNIFICATOR.

THE SECONDARY SIGNIFICATOR IS TUE PLASCT WHICH RGLES
THE DECARATE IN WIKICH THE PRIME SIGNIPICATOR HAPPLDNS TO BE
PASSING TIROUGH IN THE COURSE OF ITS DAILY MOTION IN THE
HEAVENS as shown in the ephemeris for the current year.
The use of these significators will be given further on
in this exposition. FIRST, let us look at the mothod of
DIRECTING which has been found to be a guide TO THE GEN-
ERAL MARKET OUTLOOK.

The New York Chart is set for noon on the 1?th of
May, 1792 as shown in ihe map herewith. Now at the tragic
assasination of President Abraham Lincoln we find the years
from the above date of founding to the date of that event,
APRIL 14TH, 1865, to be a period of 73 YEARS ONE MONTH.
This at the rate of 59° 8" per day (year) is 72 degrees
2 minutes and being added to the radical Midheaven of
Taurus 28 we come to the Llth degree of the sign LEO, AND.
THE ASCENDANT UNDER THIS N.C. is the Sth of SCORPIO. The
ascendant was therefore in opposition to Venus radical.

Refering to the ephemeris for 1865 we Find that on that

‘very day Neptune, the author of plots and schemes, was in

Aries 8:40 and therefore exactly on the place of the Moon

radical,

AXIOM ONE
Planets in tranéit over the radical places of the

SUN, MOON, MIDHRAVEN, AND ASCENDANT OF THE CHART have in-

fluence on the course of events accordany to their natures,
and so effect the VALUE OF SECURITIES. In November 1657
there was a considerabic panic (financial panic} on the
Exchange. Time 65 years & months. M.C, progress to Leo
2:34, Asc. in Libra 27. The Asc. is opposed to SATURI

and in conjunction with NEPTUNE. WENUS was then in the
and of LIBRA (CONJ. NEPTUNE r) and SATURN was in CANCER

in square aspect to VIINUS Midmonth in November 1657.

URANUS was in transit over M,C. radical.

AXTON_TWO
DIRECTIONS OF THE GENERAL SIGNIFICATORS, SUN, MOON,
N.C. AND ASC., TO AFFLICTING ASPECTS {SQUARE OR OPPOSITION)

OF MALEFIC PLANETS WILL CAUSE GREAT DEPRESSION OF SECURITIFS.

AXTON THREE
The ephemeris aspects to the PRIME SIGNIFICATOR WILL

TEFINE THE PROBABLE TIME FOR THIS DEPRESSION. The Railway
Strike of August 1990 at 98 years 3 Months from the founda-
tion cf the chart shows N.C. in Virgo 5. Saturn was then

in transit through that degree of the Zodiac.

AXIOM FOUR

Saturn IN CONJUNCTION, OR SQUARE OR OPPOSITION-by
transit-to ANY OF THE RADICAL PLACES OF THE GENERAL SIGNIFI~
CATORS, OR TO THEIR PROGRESSED PLACES, WILL CAUSE A SERIES
DEPRFSSTON. In August 1914 Saturn was in Gemini 28 in
square to Mays in Virgo 28. The MC. of the chart had pro-

gressed to Vargo 28. Mars was therefore in transit over
the Me. Proetetsed and Satine pan nuure tO 1b. Mais
is here the cause of the cxcitoment and Saturn thet of

the Depression.

EFFECTS OF PLAKTTS. BCLTENN in BAD ASTTCT CAUSES BEAK
SALES AND HL ACKION IS GENERALLY DUE TO "RINGS" ARB
PROFESSTONAL COMBINES MOVING FOR A LOWER BUYING LEVEL,
ITS GOOD ASPECTS ADVANCE VALUES FROM THE SANE CAUSI'S.
URANUS USUALLY BRINGS IN TR GOVERRNENT GROXTR ANT
SHOWS OFFICIAL MANIPULATION OF THE MARKET. In yooe as-
pect it makes for buying, and an bad aspect for selling.
At such times keep one eye on URANUS and the other on the

Go vernment Broker.

.

SATE Steadies the market when in good aspect, but

greatly depresses it when in evil aspect to the SYGKIPICA-
TORS, RADICAL AND PROGPESSID.

JUPITER enhances values by its conjunction or good
aspects, and causes heavy selling for profits when in bad
aspect. Lt deflates what it previously had inflated,

HARS stimulates the market und in good aspect causes
sharp rises and a brisk market, while in evil aspect it
causes Sharp depressions. Neither are enduring.

VEN, in qood aspect gives equable values and gy
steady rise in values but is not enduring. In bad aspect
it causes a flat and lifeless market.

These decans are parts of signs each ten degrees in extent
and their rulers are sct against them. When the PRIME
SICGNIFICATOR is passing through any decan it is the guest
of the ruler of that decan and is subject in some measure
to the aspects affecting that ruler so long as the PRIME
SIGNIFICATOR remains in that Decan. These can he found

in the ephemeris from week to week throughout the year and

For osange lis:
at the time of the railway strike in 18990, we find
Saturn in transat over the Wi.C. Progressed in Virg?
S and in square aspect to Mars, then an Sagittarius 3,
ami near to square of Neptune in Gemi ni 6, while Uran-
WS was in transit over Jupiter‘s place in the radix on
the cusp of the thirvt house (Railways). But venus, the
PRIME SIGNIFACATOR, was then in the end of Virgo ané
not an aspect to any planet in the heavens. The
Secondary Siqnificator is Mercury, whach rules the
hast decan of Varge, where Venus is guest. ow we
find Mercury was then in conjunction with Saturn in
Virgo 5 ang therefore square to Mars and square tc
Keptune in the heavens at the time. Here are adequate

causes for pregacting a severe set-back.

;_ OF ASPECTS

The good aspects are the trane of 120 degrees, the
sextile of 60 deyrees, the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus
and the PARALLELS of these also. The bad aspects are the
opposition of 180 degrees, the square of 90, the sesq of
135, and the seni-square of 45. Also the conjunctions of

TRANSITION POLNTS are Cormed madway between a core
and a bad aspect to the same indicator. Thus:

Venus on the &th of the month is opposition Jupiter.

On the lith is sextile Saturn.

On the 20th it is semi-square Mercury.

On the 30th it is semi- square Neptune.

Yherefore we should expect a fair amount of selling
or realizing of profits. ‘has would be followed, about

the 9th of 10th, hy a steadying influence under the ap-
preaching sextile ef Sotuen and Halarny woudl qave a

upward trend wital the soth-16¢h, which is the transition
point between Saturn and the next aspecting planet sercury.
At this tame the market turns and begins to be talked down,
and under Venus semi-square Neptune it continues down to
the 2Bth. Here it forms another transition point and pre-
ceeds io the sextile of Mercury, which it reaches on fie
uust Ind. These aspeets ave formed an duly 1914. After
the 2n¢ of August the planet venus meets the conjunction
with Mars in Virgo on the Sth, and then goes to the square
of Saturn, the change of Decan taking place on August 2rd
ang changing the good influence of Mercury to that of Mars
{war}. Venus, being then in the last decan of Virgo, ruled
by Hercury, we have further indication of Mercury conjunc~
tion Neptune at that time, showing a state of chaos. The
direction for 122 years 3 months is 120 degrees 29 minutes
and it will be seen that if we add this amount to the H.C,
ef the wadin (Taurus 28) we arrive at just this same po-
sition in the zodiac, namely Virgo 26, which is occupieé

by Mars and Venus in square aspect to Saturn in Gemini at
that time. ‘So we have good reason for anticipating a consi6-
erable etir in the markets of the world and a great depre-

ciation of values.

by those eno are on the spot and watching the clock and
ticker, for at wil] be found that the course of the mar-
ket fellows the MMRIDIAS TRANSIT of the planets and the
aspects [ormed to them by the other at the time of thear
transit. Takang the Sun as indicating noon position, it
will be seen that some planets precede the Sun an@ others
follow it. Thus at the beginning of August 1914 we have
Sun opposition Uranns, on the 2nd of the month, followed
by the Sun somi-syuuore Saturn on the 6th. The heaviest
point should therefore be on the 4th, or mid-castence be-
tweon the aspects. On that date Mercury passec over the
MERIDIAN 19 degrees, or 1 hour 16 minutes before noon, in
opposition at she time to the Noon. About 24 minutes later
Nepturne passed the HLRIDIAW, Then cam the Sun at Loon in
Orpositaen to Yranus and approachiny the semi-squarc of
Saturn. Here we have the big depression. It is followed
by the transit of Jupiter over the lower Meridian et 12+28
or 28 minutes after noon. Then there is a lot of selline
done. Then comes Mars and Venus, in close conjunction it
Mirgo 23+24 degrees in sextile to Mercury in Cancer 22, but
also coming to the square of Saturn in Gemini. This would
be about 3:50 P.M. Local Time, and it then became a press-
ing question as to Peace or War -- Maxs or Venus -- gues-

tion Lhat would serve no market any good.

an Pisees 7 and had oo aspects. But it vas then in the Dec:

On the 12th of March 1914, there was an exbipse of the
tloon which fell in Virgo 21. Incidentally, it happened te

of the Sun, multiplied by 113, the years elapsed since 1€0!,
gives 111 deg. 26 min,, or 3 signs, 21 degrees, 26 main.

gainst Serbia by Austria on the 28th. On the Jkst a state
of war was declared in Germany, who declared war on Russia
en the 3lst or lst of August and invaded Luxendourg on the
same date, French territory being invaded on Avqui-t 2nc.
This war and the exact date of it was forseen by “Sepharial"
and notified by him in print throughout the country as carly
as July 1413,

the prediction of War and the date was defined by! the trar-
sit of Mars over this triple combine of Viryo Pisces meri-
dian.

‘the fisesl troubles which have dominated all Britisna
politics urese from the eclipse of the meridian degece for
the year 1914, aad its effects could be traced right through
to 1918, when, as early as August lst, 1514, “Sepharial"
fixed the end of the war in these words: “The war will
be Titanic and will last until 1918" -~-

Tne Hohenzollerns will bite the dust and gather the DLAD

hen for the last time in the perioi of 4 years (dura-

then said: "Hostilities will cease in November of this

(1914-1918) to Virgo 20, we reach Virgo 24, and under this
meridian in the latitude of Longon we Lind Scorpio 29:24

I have provided a copy of this letter in the back of the Book. Phase read it over before reading this section.

First, 1 will show you where Gann is getting some of the prices ke is using an this Letter shaw are not listed
¢s Major highs or lows, In the first paragraph, Gann exys “The one-half point of che bighest selling price
and one-half between the high and low are very great because these equal dre 45-degree angle or the
gravity center, For May Beans these prices are 218 3/8, 240 3/8, 251 7/8, and 319 1/8”. On this page you
will Gad four prices tut are hard to explain. These are $218 3/8, $240 3/8, $251 7/8 and $319 8. The first
ptice is the emidpoint of the $436 % high (436 2}, The 240 3/8 price is the extreme low of 44 + the high of
436 Ya divided by 2 (436% -Md= 480 % £2). The 251 7/6 peice is the low price at 67 + the high price 436 %
divided by 2. Finally, the 319 1/8 price is the low at 201 4 + 436 % high divided by 2, Gam then starts
adding proportionate parts of the circle to these prices. He is also directly referencing the carrespoading
2odiac longitude to the price levels. What he is doing is creating an Astrological aspectarian of price. He is
trying to calculate where the Trines and squares are to different price Sevets. Gann suid that hese where the
“mathematical reasons” why Soybeans arade a bottom at $2014. The extreme low a1 44 + 360 = 404, Both
of these prices would equai L4 Taurus. The midpoint or one-half point is 202 (404/2) « 22 Libra. The ew
of 201 %4 occurred February 9*, 1949, This price is equal so 1$ Leo on the “Circle Chart”. On dhis date, you
will find Pluto at $5 Leo {conjunel the price), Neptune at £5 Libra {Sextile to price}, Jupiter is 15010 price,
ee,

The nex part of the ketter talks about active oc live engles. “By live or active angles is meant Prices and
Tame Periods where the langimde of the major planets ere or where the squeses, (rimigies, oppositions are
to these planes”. “Examples of live, active angles: Al the present writing, Jan. 18*, 1954, Satum
Geoceutric is 8 to 9-degrees Scoxpio. Add the square or 90-degrees gives 8 to 9-degrees Aquarius and
equals the price $309 for May Beans”, He then does the same agpect procedure for Jupiter al 21 Gemini +
13S-degrees = 305 or 6 degrees Aquarius. In this paragraph, Gana is using pure kmgitude to price
conversicas, In the next paragraph Titked 24 Revolutions of Thame asd Price Gann is using the Circle
‘Chart. An Interesting thing aboul Gann's first example of xn “active angle” is related to the firs trade
horoscope (asta!) for Soybeans. Gann said “October 5®, 1936, fatures trading started ia Soybeans, The frst
sale was 120°. If we cast a horoscope for this date, we can actually sco why Satum's position is “active”.

ee
K SE TET ws

par toned

From the above exarapte, you can see that Satum was “active” because it was transiting natal Venus and
was in opposition to natel Uranus. Jupiter was “active” by a conjunction with the natal moon,

‘Gann says, “The power of Satum and Jupiter aspects, working out time to these Price Resisuamce Levels, is
what halts the advance in Soybeans”,

Gann then moves on 19 his circle chart, He instructs his student to circke all the low prices with a red
circle and all the highs with a green circle, Then note the Angles of 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 180, 225, 240,
270, 300, 315, and 360 from each high and low, These are not geometric anglest These are ssirological
angles on the circle chart or "Mester Char”. Gann then gives an example for December 2, 1953, May
Soybeans high $31 1%4, [f you place the planets on the circle chart, you will get the prices Gann is talking:
abou When he mentions that this price is 120-degrees of the averages he ia talking about the MOF
Formula, CE Avernge or the Average of Six that | discussed earlier. He says * Having before you alll dhe
information outlined above, you would certainly have gone short of May Soybeans oa December 2, 1953
wad covered your shorts on Decenber 17* at 296 because the price was down to the 4$-degrec angle from
44 on the monthly high low chat”. The Momtly high low chart indicates Gann was referring to 1 Satam
geometric angle from the iow price of 44. When you read Gam, you cm almost always substitute the word
month for Saurn. The 44 low occurred December 1932. Fro this time period to December 1953, br helio.
Moved 267.067 degrees, The 121 -anghe @ 0.93 7S/degree would = $250.375 + 44 = $294.375 which is
withio 1.625 cams of Gann’s 296 price. Using his shortcut method, December 1932 to 1953 = 2 years
times 12 (months) = $252 + the 44 low = $295, Another interesting point about the 2Eprice shat Gana.

said to cover the short position is that oo this particular day, Pinto’s first trade loagitnde was activated by a
transiting square of Mers i.e. Mars square mal Pluto on the circle chart “Mastor Chart”. See the above
horoscope:

‘This concludes my analysis of Gann, if you study and apply the above techniques, I think you will
have a greater appreciation of WD Gann and the work thai he did. Most peopte trade the markets a3 4
secondary hobby or interest, Genn made it his profession and worked cxiremely hard at his cra. [f you are
net a5 seriows ag Gann, then you cat aot achieve the same results. Fortunately, we have computers today
that can do a lot of the tasks, Gann had to do his work without the aid of even a simple calculator. Put the
lime into your studies and the resukts should fallow.

end olso the tae required lo square the Ronge ond where this squore works out ia the Master
Squore of 144,

EXAMPLE: The lowest price thal whesl ever sold was 28¢ per dushet in March, 1852.
Therefore, every 28 morhs would square the lowest price. The highest price that whest evar
sold for was.on May 11, 19¢7, when the Moy option sald et $3.25. Therefore, it would require
32S months to square the highest price. The lowest price that the May option aver sold was
446. Therefore, it would require 44 montis in lime-to square the low price. The range belieen
44¢ ond $3.25 {5 $2.81 which would require 281 months, 28+ weeks or 281 terys 1p square
‘the range. You would took on the Mester Chart end see thet 2 squares of 144 equa) 288,
therefore, you woutd watch for @ cheage In lend between 281 ond 288 of neor the end of the
second square of 144, 7 x 44, tha extreme low, equals 308, therefore, 6 1/2 times 44 would
equal 286, which is within lwo ooints of the end of the square af 144 or Une end of Ihe second
squore tieking 286 an important Lime period to watch for a change in trend In Ssquering the
high of $3.25, the highest price for Hay wheal would be 2 squares of 144 end 37 over,
therefore, when Lhe lime reached 36 days, weeks ar months in Use Maser Squara of (44 you

Can see thal resistence would be mel because moving up Uie time per lod of 136 you see thal tne
48 degree angle moving dawn from 72, which is lhe INNER SQUARE ond the line drawn acrosa

OURLY TIME PERIODS

When Markets ere very active and moking a wide tongs in price, it is important to
keep an houcly High end Low Chart, just the seme es you keep the Daily ttigh and Low Chect and
the Hourly Chert will give the frst change in wend.

There are 24 hours in ¢ day, therefore, 6 days are required lo pass through #44 and
a total of 86-4 days to pass through the square of 144,

Al the present lime, all exchanges are open 5 days 8 week with the exception of
holidays snd most of them ore open S hours esch day. Therefore, ii will require 25 days ond 4
hours to pass through 144 al the rete of 5 hours per day and 5 days per week, Trading lime for
graing ts 225 minutes or 5.75 hours per day or 36 days and | 1/2 hours 40 pess through 144
et the rate of 3.75 hours per day ond 5 days par week.

OREAT YEARLY TIME CYCLE:

To pess through the squane of 144, which equats 20,736, il requires SS years, 9
months and 23 days, which is. 0 very (mpartant time cycle, Next In importence is 1/2 of this

Place it over Whe chart to get the position in the next square,

STRONGEST AND WEAKEST POINTS:

Where the greatest number of angles crass or bézact each other in the square of 144
are the points of greoteal resistance, such as where the 25 and 2 x | angles cross each other.

or vibrations of each space in e@ squirs, For exa=ple:-

APPENDIX G

MARKET VOLUME

Market Votes

In the back of this work, you will find a two-page course that I believe was written by Garm Titled:
TRENDS. This course deals with market wends and the correlation betwren transactional

volume. Gann says, “ The trend of stock prices is influenced by supply and demand. The object of
fotlowimg a chart fs to determine whether stocks are in a period of accumulation, or distribution; whether
stocks are being marked up or down, ar whether they are being left alone”. It is suggested thet you read
this small course a this ime and also Gann‘a course on Form Reading and also my notes from Ted
Warren's Bock: HOW TO MAKE THE STOCK MARKET MAKE MONEY FOR YOU, which is also
included with this book.

Now that you have had time to review the sbove referenced araterial, | vill discuss my opinion of
volume and ’s significance in forming an opinion on the markets. Because there is always a seller for
every buyer, and a buyer for every seller on wry given dary with the exception of Limit moves and Panics,
volume simply records the total number of units that resulted in a transaction becween the buyer and seller.
The volume data in this format has Kimited uses but tharc ure several books that have been writen by
various authors discussing how to Interpret market movements from this raw form of the data. My personal
siew is that volume needs to be converted 60 that it more scouralely represents buymg pressure and selling
pressure or supply vs, demand. Because we already know that you must have « buyer for every seller and
vice versa before any volume can be recorded, we need (0 determine how this number of units relates to
price fluctuations, If we take the fundamental view that the only reason prices advance is simply because
there was a greater denaand to parchase the stock or commodity than there was a willingness to sell the item
al the current existing price. Prices decline because there is a greater willingness to sel! the stock or
commodity verses the demand for the item at the current price, Selling panics occur when there are no
buyers for the itens at the current price of sven substantially lower prices (zero danand drivea) Buying
panics occur when there are no sellers a1 the current price and is obviously a supply driven scenario,

Many analysis have argued that the supply of any stock or commodity is definable simply because you
¢an not instantly create more coffee, corn, oil or shares of a particular stock. These analysts belicve that the
available supply of the item is what creales the demand that will eventually show up es volume or 2
transaction between buyer mid seller, However, this paint of view is not entirely accurate because short
selling creates fictional or phantonn units of the particular eu and therefore distorts or enlarges the
available supply of the en. This eneans thal to make tohmne understandable, we must look at it as it
relates to the desire Lo buy ov sell any item x a given moment and we musi also quantify this desire.

What { like to do Lo determine this desire is to ook at the percent change up or down on 4 given day and
tmoltiply this fraction by the volume on that day, For example: lets say thal Cisco Systems, Inc, (CSCO) is
up $1.00 today on 55 million shares from 77% the day before. The % change is 1 divided by 77% or
0.0128. This fraction mukipiied by the vohume of $5 million shares Is 707,395 and represents the lack of
selling desire or excess densand, If the price had dectined $1.00 on this volume it would represent the buck
of buying desire or a greater snpply. So based on the advancing scenario, we would assume thal of the 55
million shares treded this day, that desire to buy exceeded the willingness to sefl by 707,395 shares. This
umber will now let us separate the Supply & Denand forces as il relates to whole volume. 55,000,000
divided by 2 is 27,500,000 and this represents perfect balance of desire to sell and willingness to buy.
27,500,000 — 707,395 = 26,792,606 (supply) und 27,500,000 + 707,395 = 28,207,395 (demand) You can
plot these numbers on graph paper ox have a spread sheel program like Microsoft Excel maintain the chart
and data, This will give you a much bener visual picture of the psychology in the market 46 i! pertains to
Gann’s niles on volume. Another valuable calculation is to take the supply volume mumbers and divide
them by the total number of shares that the company actuslly has issued (for a commodity, use the
Goverrunent cstimates of supply). This raito will show the percentage of turmover im the stock or how
actively the stock is changing hands. When a stock is in “strong” hands, this number is low because the big
Block share holders have bitte if'any willingness to se, When distribution is taking place (Form reading +
Cycle Timing), this number will show a pretty dramatic increase compared to it’s relative history during the
up trend or “Mark-up” phase. The market is chuming as the inventory is moving from strong to weak
hands. This information should hetp you with volume analysis,

CAPITAL REQUIRED

The firat point to consider in opsrating any method on the stock market is the

that will make profits and never lose your capital ie the xind of a method that
every man should follow to make a success.

As a general rule, I have always considered it advisable to wee at leapt $3,000
ompital for every 100 sharea of stock traded in and to limit stop loss orders t
not more than 3 pointe om every 100 shares. In this may you will be able to make
10 ‘trades on your capital and the market would have to beat you 10 consecutive
times to wipe out your capital, which it will Dot do. Whatever amount of capita)
you use to trade with, follow thia tule: Divide your capital inte i0 aquel parte
and never rick more than 10% of your capital on any one trade, Should you lose

Yemeining capital. If you follow thie rule, your succees is sure.

_ On stocks selling around $16 to $30 per share, you can start with a capitel oJ
$1,806. The firet trate should be made at m time when you cen place a etop los
order not more then 2 pointa away and you should try to start shen your risk wil}
only be 1 point. In other words, with a capital of 1,500 you must figure that
you would be able to mike at ieast 7 to 10 trades and the oarket would have
beat you 7% to 10 conseoutive times to wipe out your trading capital. With tbl:
Method it ie impossible for that to happen, provided you follow the rulee alr

This Usthod will make the moot money trading in high-priced stocks, amd fo:
trading in stocks sailing above $100 per share, you should uee a capital of $4,001

If you want to start trading in owel) unite of stock, wee & capital of $300 fo:

Taie formation can ba 5 sharp, fast decline followed by a fast advance, or even
a slow decline Zollowed by a quick relly from the bottom with no sécondary reacs
tions until it advances to higher ierels.

Example: July 26, 1910, the Dow-Sonee 20 Railroad averages had 4 sharp ‘decking
to 1052; then rallied sharply to 1142 ... a 9-point advance with no reaction,
a.» apd did not later go back to make a double bottoa.

TOP FORMATIONS

You should study the various types of topu-- harp, flat, double, triple, and
descending tops.

SINGLE "A" OR SHARP TOP

After & prolonged advence or at the end of a Bull Campaign, the averaged or in-
dividual stocks often make a single eharp top ... advancing 17 to 26 weeks or more
with only emali reactiona Lasting sometines 10 daye to tro weeks .,. then foliong

safer to ell when it breaks the last leg of the *A" or when it breake the bottoa

of the first sharp declins. : .

Example: The 20 Reilroed averages advanced from 117} to 1234 in 16 weeks from
May 24 to September 15, 1008; then hed & sharp decline to Cotober 18, and only
rallied to 1234. When they broke 1182, it wae an indication of menkioss and
the Bear Market continued, .

»*f1" TOP OR FLAT TOP

When the market makes several tops near the same level and the bottoms on reno-
tions are near the eame level ... holding in a narrow trading range .,, it forms &
“1 top ox Lat top. It ig safe to sell abort when it breako under the series of
weekly bottoas.

Exaple: May 13 to July 29, 1932, the Railroad averages held in a range of 23
points for & weeks, forning a flat top, and the market was a safe short salo
shen the averages broke 141, under the low point of thie narrow Tange.

®M* TOP OR DOWSLE TOP

Thon « stock or the averages reach top after 4 substantial sdvance; then react
3 to 7 weeke or more and xaliy again to around the same top, oD "M" or double top
ia formed. ‘then, when it declines and breake under the low of the last reaction
or under the middle of the "KM", 4¢ is safe to pelt short.

Exauple: 1906, Saptember 16 high 137%; November 17 low 131};
Decendbexr 15 high 1373; then followed a quick
decline, breaking the low of 1814, and a Baer
Market followed.

"MAY TOP OR TRIPLE TOP

Thia formation occurs when a stock or the averages make 3 tops near the some
evel or the 2nd abd 314 topa are slightly lower. When these formatione are cade
at tops after a long advance, they are sigtals for a major decline. The more tine

BEOTIONS OF MARKET CAMPAZOND
& Buli or Bear Campaign in stocks or the averaged runs out in 5 to 4 seotions--
BULL RAREST

Pr

lat Bootion - Advance after final bottom; then & secondary Tenoction,

4nd Section ~ Advance to higher Level, above the highs of previous
weoke and of the first advance; then a reaction.

3rd Seotion - Advance to new high for the move, In matiy cases this
meena the end of the campaign, but you must wmtoh for
& definite indication before deciding that the Sm ron
Up means 8 change in the main trend,

4th Seotion - Often four sectione are run out ant thie th xove og
Tun-up is the most important to watch for the end of a
Bull Campaigo snd a change in trend.

Kinor Bull Campaigns of ehort duration, rumping one year or leas, often run out
in two secticns, sepecially if the first section ia from s, eharp bottow,  There-
fore, always natoh the action of the mrket after the second advance to woe if it
ia forming & top and giver indications of a change in tread.

BEAR MARKET

A Bear Campaign rung opposite te a Bull Campaign-- —

let Section - There ie a sharp, severe decline which changes the main

trend; then a aecondary rally on which stocks are epfor
short sales, That warks the end of the let Section.

ond Section ~ Then there i@ a ascond decline to lower prices, fol-
lowed by a moderate rally. .

3rd Seotion - & third decline of move to #6121 lower prices, which
way be the end of the campaign.

4th Section ~ There is often o 4th move, when you must watoh cloesly
for bottom. In determining whether 1% 19 final bottos,
you we all of the other rules .., watohing old tope
ang old bottome for definite indication that the sein
tTend is ready to change.

Winor Bear Campaigns of short duration, rufhing «ne year or less, often ron ont
in tno sections, especially if the lst Section is from a sharp top. Therefore,
alvayo watch the action of the market after the 2nd decline to sea if it ie fora-
ing a bottom and gives indication of a change in trend.

In extreme cases, like 1920 and the Bear Campaign which followed from 1929 to
1933, there are as many as 7 sections up or dom, but thie ie atnormel snd unususl
ané only ocoure many yeare apart. .

Go back over all of the campaigns me have worked out and you will see how these
scotions or moved run out.

HOW TO DETERMIZE CHANGE IM THE Wall TREND

BPACE MOVEMERT
RULE FOR DETERMENTNG CHANGE IM TREND ACCORDING TO BPACK MOVRMENTS--

When & decline in pointe exceeds the tent decline of a previous xeaction by
one or more pointa, it is ap indication oH 3 change in trend.

When the market has run out 3 or more seotiona in a Bull Campaign, go dack over
the recom and find out what the greatemt reaction bam been in any section, wheth-
er 10, 15, 30, W points or more. Suppose the averages have been advancing for a
long time and the greatest reaction in the Bull Market has been 10 pointe and the
market has reached the 3rd or 4th Section of the campaign. hep tho first timo

averages or tha price of a stock bac) rg than 1 inte, of mo

the greatest reaction, it io am indication that the pain trend haa changed or wii)
change goon. Thie dose not mean thet a raliy onaunct take place after thie defi-
nite signal of revereal has been given, as usually after the first aignsl of a
change in trend io g¢iven, there is a secondary Tally in « Bull Market snd time hea
to be allowed at top for distribution to tare place. Therefore, just because you
get a definite indication that the main trend Aas changed, de not juap to tha con-
clusion that you can sell short Tight at that time and that there will de no ral-
ly. Alwaya o¢ll on rallies, if possibile, altho there are times that you can sell
at cew low levels or when bottome are broken, Judge thie by applying all of your
rules, '

TIME PERIOD -- Another ray to tell when the main trend ia changing.

1

ROLE-- then a campaign has only 3 or 4 eeotions and the TIUE period on s reac
tion exceede the greatest time of a previous reaction, consider that the mst

trend hae changed,

_ Go back over the record and find the greateat time period from any minor top o
the duration of a reaction in previous geotions of the Balt warket, 1¢ you fix
that the greatemt reaction haa been about ¢ wecke, then the firet time the terke
declines consecutively for § weeke or more, it is en indication that the mt
trend has changed and that stocks will be short sales on a secondary rally,

Apply the come rules'in a Bear Warket, When the SPACE movement or Dumber o
pointe that a stock or the averages have rallied during « Bear Campaign 18 exased
ed, the trend is changing, When the TIME peried of the createmt reverge movanee
46 exceeded, then the wain trend is changing and a Bull Campaign fa starting.

A yevergal in SPAOD movement after the acoond run or 2nd Beotion ina Ball or
Bear Warket, would not mean as important a change in trend as if it oases after th
Sra or 4th Seotion had run out, either up or dom,

Eranplem of #11 theae rulee wild be referred to in the working ont of each Bul
and Bear Campaign from 1689 to 1938 060 that you will tnow dust how to apply th.
Tales in future market movencnte, ‘

WANT FEEXE IW FARROW RAUCE

Then a etook or the averages hold for a to 6 weeks or 10 to 33 weeko in 2 mr
row range, then orcas tops or break bottome of previous weeks, the trend ha
changed and you ghould go sith tt. 1 the pericd of time in a narre

yange, the greater the advance or the declina when Shey bresk out of the range
gither up or down,

Trampie: 1697, January 16 te March 20, the Railroad sverages Aeld in &-poin

& S-point range for 6 weeks; then crossed the top at 61 ant the Eull Marre
otarted.

ACCUMULATION OR DISTRIBUTION OM 5108

After a market hao advanced to the Sra or 4th Section, thec has @ sharp deolin:
and Tallies, 1t will often renain for a long period of time in a Yenge while DIS
TRIBUTION 16 taking place OM THE SIDE. The top ef the range sey be several poiet
delow the extreme high. In FORM READING it is very important to note the rang!
from high to low in this zone of distribution. ‘The steck ie @ short pale at th
top of thie zange of distribution of the aide and s safer sale when it breake th
low point of this range -.. which ig the BREAKAWAT POTHY.

At the ond of a Bear Canpaign, after the first sharp advance there is & secoud
ary reaction; then # long period of ACCUMULATION OM THE SIDE, with ooveral more!
up to the top of the range and back to the bottom of the range of eocumistia
The market is a buy at tho bottom of this range and a safer buy when the tops 0!
thie range are oroseed as that 1# the BREAKAWAY POIUT and ¢ signal for a fast ad:
vanoe.

Exemplea of these sideways accummlation and eidemare dietribution will be ence
in the different campaigns worked: cut.

il
LAST STAGE OF BULL OR BEAR MARKET

In fast, advancing marketa in the last stage of the campaign Teactions got
emailer as stocks mork to higher levels, until the finel section or rum hes ended,
Then comes a sharp, quick reaction and a reversal in trend.

In the last stage of & Bear Market, after all old bottoms and resiatance levely
have been broken, ‘rallies gat lega or aualler aa prices work lowsr, Therefore,
people eho buy hava no chance to eel] of rallies until the final bottom has dveeu
reached and the firet rally takes place.

Thie 1¢ why it mever pays to buck the trend in the last stage of a Bull Market
or the laat atage of a Bear Market,

RANGE OF BOTTOMS

Hover cousider that a major or a minor trend hae reversed or chatged until tne
bottoms of previous waeka have bean broken or the tops of previous meets have been
crosged. ‘The number of points that a etook or the averages should decline below a
bottom to indicate a change in trend to lower levals, varies accoming to the
price at which the averages or the stock is selling. We conei¢er & Tange within 1
to 3 pointe 6 double or triple bottom or a double or triple top. In a atrong mr-
ket @ stook will break only 1 point under a bottom and then rally and, in ertrome
onees, Ot More than 2 pointe. Ags 6 rule when bottome are broken by 3 full pointa
1¢ ig an indication for lower prices before any rally of importance.

RARGE OF TOPS

The same at the top, The range for double tops i# sbout 3 points. These tops
can be in a Tange of 1 to 3 pointe and atill be conmeidered double and triple tops.
Advancing 1 to 3 points above an old top does not slumya indicate thet the main
trend has changed and that atocka are goitg up immediately bot advancing 2 pointe
above old tops i@ nearly always a definite indication that higher prices will, fol-
low before much renotion. At the end of Bull or Bear Uarketa some fatae moves are
often made and quick reversals follon,

HOW FAR SHOULD STOCKS DECLIVE BELOR OLD TOPS AFTER THEY ADVANGE ABOVE THial?

In order +0 still show uptrend, after a stock ox the averages have advanced
above old topa, then resoted, when in strong position they wiil stop right around
the old tope or sometime go 1. to 2 points below the old topa but seldom more than
3, Regardleed of how high o atock 4e seliing, a decline of more than 5 points be-
low the old top would indicate that the trend had reversed and st thet immediate
tine the stock would not go higher but would go lower for awhile. It oan decline
5 points under old tope and stili be in a Bull Narket, 412 depending on what sec-
tion the market ig in. A eignal in the last cection 1s mont important.

HOW FAR STOCES CaM GO ABOVE OLD BOTTOMS IW BEAR MARKETS

Reverse this rule ino Bear Market. hen stocke advance ta 01d bottoms, ‘they
are short eales because dottoma become tops and tops become bottoms. They should
not «oO more than 1 to 3 poluts above the old bottoms and on an averege phonld not
go more than 3 points. Therefore, even when etocks are at high levels if they ac-
vance more than 5 pointe above an old bottom, it is an indication that they arc
coiug Wigher and are not going to work lower immediately with the main trend.

1,
SEVERAL FAST MOVES UP OR DOWW OVER A RANGE OF & TO 7 OR 20 TO 12 FoINts

Whether the market is very active or ina slow trading range, all indtoatica,
are more accurate and more valuable when tho market is quite active.

After a stock or the averages have been advancing for some time aod hare my
out Sor 4 section, if there are several moves of 10 to 18 points up or down ine
yauee, making seversi bottoms and several tops in thie’ range, it indicates eithsy
acoumulation or distribution. When the bottoms in a range of thie kind are broker
it 19 an indication of lower prices and when the tope in a range of thie kind ar
crossed, it ig an indication of higher prices. Wote the range on @ideways aoovum-
lation und the range on sideways distribution. .

An advanoing market may have several reactions of 10 to 12 points; then have e
Teaction of 20 to 84 pointe; then after an advance if it declines from any top more
then 20 points, i¢ #11] ueusliy run 50 to 40 points. Go over the stooke or aver-~

agen mhen they have buen selling at very high levels and prove to youresl< ths
value of thie rule,

"HEH THE UARKET IG IW STRONOKST POSITION OR IA WEAXEST POSITION

A stook or the averages aro in the atrongect position after there hes beena

eet when you get ib on a move of this kind,

Reverse thia rule in a Bear Market. A market i¢ weakest when it fe making lon-

HOW 0 DETIRNIVE FIRST CHANGE IW TREND

The Weekly high and low Chart with the opening and closing prices on it io one
of the best charts to wee for determining trent of otooke or the averages. thet:

iven #1: eo indications a:

The ologing price at the end of the reek or at the end of any day ig most in-
portant because regardless of how high or how low stooke have deen during the week
or during the day, the closing price shops exactly what they have lost or gained
at the and of the period.

after a otock or the Gvernges have been advancing for a considerable period of
time and have reachad an ole top or a section of the campaign which indicates that
# change in tren@ could take place, 1t 19 vory important in very notive markets to
witch the opening price on Yonday morning. Should the averages or a ptock not

Cline and ologe at or near the low levels of the week on Saturday, 1t is the first
indication of a change in trend on the Weekly Chart, But don’t fail to use your

WHEN BTOCES ADTAWOE INTO YEW AIGH GROOWD
OR DECLINE INTO NEW LOR GROUND

When atocks advance to higher levels than they havea been defore in their preri~
ous history or decline to lower levels than they have ever sold befors in their
history, they are in new high or new low cround and you must have a Tule to follow
when stooks reaoh new high or new low record prices.

First, ‘apply ‘aa of your other rulea and do not buy or aelL until there ia a
definite indication of a change in the wain trend. . .

When @ stock of the averages advance to a new high level that they have never
g01d at before in their history, it ie an indication of an advances of 7, 10, 15,
20 to 4 pointe or more, especially if it im in the let or End Beation of the Bull
Campaign. Should new highs be made in the 3m or 4th Section, then the advance
into bew high grpund may not be very many pointe before Zimal high is reached spd
the trend changes,

You should wafch the action of the sarket when it has advanced 7 pointe into
new bigh territery, 10 points, sagein around 15 pointe, and on an extreme advance
match around 80 to 24 pointe, where there is likely to be resistance and top cade.
Thege are average moves and it depends upan the activity atid the price of # stook
whether it wili atop on any of these points. By following the trend indications
aiid rules you wilt be able to determine when the firet wove into new hich territo-

TY hag run ovt and the trend has changed, -
Reverse the above rulea in a Bear Campaign.

When the averages or stocks selling between 60 and 125 advance into new high
sround, these average movements of 7, 10, 15, 20 and 34 points, work out quite ac-
ourately. After stocke advance above 125, they wove faster and go digher that
thay do below 125, Above 200, the movement increases aud the range io much wider.
The same when stocks or the averaged got ahove 306 ... they have a still greater
range and faster moves, all of which depends upon how long the campaign has boel
ronning and how many moveg or cections the campaign hos yun cut and how high the
etockd are from the last bottom or how far down from the last top.

FRE TO USE DAILY HIGH AND LOW ORART

When marketa are very ective and fluctuating over a wide range, especially in ~
the last stages of a Bull Market or the last fast decline in a Bear Market, you
should keep up a Daily high and low hart on the averages or individual stooks and

HOW TO MAKE THE STOCK MARKET MAKE MONEY FOR YOU
. BY
TED WARREN 1963

THE FOUR BASIC PHASES / CYCLES OF STOCK PRICES.

(1) ACCUMULATION - Quiet Jow level period, stock is being accunmlated from weak shareholders by

the manipalators, Volume is comparatively low “wearing out* the weak sharcbolders resolve 1 hold the
Stock.

(2) MARKUP - The stock is now in strong hands ( manipulators & insiders ) and the stock begins to rise,

@) DISTRIBUTION - Stock prices have neared oc reached their peak, volume is high, the public is
insanely excited ( “Tulipmanda* } ingo buying at a pace tat far exceeds the rate M which they sell. The
Stock is transferred from strong to weak hands,

(4) MARKBOWN - The stock has been successfully distributed to the meak hands of the public and the
price of the stock begins to incyitably Fall.

changing to those who KNOW what they are doing, aad WHY. *

” There can never be a sound base, tonless a Farge percemtage of the public has for one reason or another
sald oe"

“ When a stock appears unable to tise above an apparent ‘texistance level’, this is almost positive proof
‘that it eventually will, because this schon indoves public selling.”

* To de a successful investolator, you nrust leara to recognize what kind of aciioa is discouraging to the
public, and then form a contrary opinion.”

* Buy 2 stock after a low price range of base of several years has formed, especially, after it has turned
“exicemely quiet’ ( low volume ) for several mouths,"

* From. a sound base, you should expect af least a 200% profit,” Additional technical strength would
justify higher profit expecuatioas,

* The soonder the base, ihe beuer the chance of a very large rise.” ‘You can't build skyscrapery on weak
foundations,

"MGRAL : an icvestolater sboukd NEVER sell at a loss} “

.

" There is no better proof unat 3 stock will go up, then when it acts as if can’t.“

LONG TERM READ & SHOULDERS BOTTOM FORMATIONS : ° The depressing influence of a
head and shoulders bottom, which is so necessary during the accumulation phase, lhes in the fact that the

pubtic is frightened ( "she shakeout ‘) during the firs shoulder and the head. During the second shoulder,
unty seli cal their positions in fear that the price wall drop down again. They have lon hope in the socks
ability to go up. ~

” You would not be justified in expecting much over a 100% rise from a bead and shoulders bottom
formation. Of course, if it is in conjunction with another base formation, then you may raise your sights
in anticipating 4 much larger rise. *

Bi x° There comes a ting when panic selling hits ihe stock marke,
When the pubthe panics, for a period of a month oF so, il is a rare stock that does not drop i its value.
Some will merely sag, while others will break wide open. For others, this break may be the beginning of a
Tong, drawn out accummlation base petiod. NEVER consider buying these weak stocks after a sharp break
ho mater bow low Uvey may appear. Rather than buying stocks at what “publicty" appear to be low prices
after a general break, check the charts closely for those Jew stocks that resisted the general marker break.
They will atwact very tnde attention by their action { or lack of it , bul they show one of Une most positive
indications of internal tectmaical strengih. Heavy selling fails to develop in these particular stocks because
the public majority of Milquetoasts and Nervous Nellies have long ago sold oul The minor selling thet
dees appear is well take Sp the Smart Mansy.”

* An investolator must realize that a fair percemage of the public ntust be sokd oat before a stock has a
chance for a proditable rise. “

" Long Team wend lines cannet be ignored 1 The extremely steep downtrend Lines, when they are broken
by an upswing are the trend lines of rast valng (ic, Ube Ieest reliable }. *

* Tae slow gradnal downtrend line of at feast two years doration, thot forms after a stock has had a very
Targe drop, and eads with sxncepee aufemcas » sives a near perfect bay signal mhen broken. *

UPTRENDS : + Ifyou bought 9 stock ot a sound base, you should seldom consider selling 2s Loog a ine
1i9¢ is Sival or merely slow, sro weatter how High it hes moved. Slow uptrends when broken, should be
ignored. Usually, they are caly interruptions ( o¢ shakeouls } durimg the markup. The rise 4s too slow (
and quiet } to be considered a distribution.”

SELLING YOUR STOCK POSITION : * There are cwo prerequisites 10 be met before you shoukd
consider sciling yoor stock position + ¢ fast rate of clims and tia percemtage of rise from itt dase.
Distribution can seldom take place uniess the public are insanely excited Loto buying a 3 pace far above
that al which they are selling. This excitement cum be generated by Ube mere rising of stock prices ¢
Tulipmanda >. With proper assistance by the manipulators, when ( io their opiaton } ube time is ripe, a
Tige Will be accelerated and peblicized to 2 degres that will give condidence to even the most timid Mz,
Milquetoast It is then that distribution takes place. There are a wide variety of disurfbution Lopa, both ia
periods of time and range of price. During these tops, there are Heayr bripieg weves by the public < high
volume}, tt is quite possible for the insiders to sell in six months what ii took them sixteen years to
secumulate. “

Anouber prerequisite is : ° Has the stock risen to heights you were justified in believing il should go,
according to the length of ime and type of acon during its previous hase? In other words, ihe sounder
the foundation, the higher the rise to b¢ expected. From a base of for years, you should expect a
Oxinimum rise of over 200% from its average base price, A longer base would indicate more, If as tbe

early slow markup proceeded, it Spent years at one oF two price levels consolidating, this would be a
positive buildup of more intemal strength and you cant expect another 100% - 306% rise based on uhe
ariginal base price. *

"You must sell when an uptrend line of ver 43 degrees has been posiuvely broken, providing thai the
percentage rise has been at of above che minimum reasonably expected sccordiag to ils base formalion, *

* NEVER scl a stock short when wading solume is exuemely light ( quiet) "
Buying stocks on margins is a smart way to keverage your purchasing power.

VOLUME : ” Volume is always comparatively light (quiet } when a stock is oader accumulation, Lhe
"wearing owt ” process of induciag the weak sharebolders to scl gat. The public selilag is light, but Geir
buying t even less *

* Volume stust be heavy during diswibudion, *

* Stocks can show fectnical strengih by the lighmess of its volume. The sock is in strong hands and
there is litde of it for sale."

STOCK SPLITS : * L have a different viewpoint 23 to why mos stocks are split, it ie may opinion, ut
ube real reason is not te have the shares mare widely held « ii is to make the shares easier to be widely
™ distributed™ ot the top. It is easier to “disribate" more shares 21 a lower price Uhan jt is 19 “disoribane”
jess shares of Uhe stock ala higher price. The public 15 dollar conscious as vo the stocks price DAM not
dollar wise.”

The Futures Markets

When an cvend seus leat likely to occur from a waders viewpoint, that's when it is mon likely to
happen.

To be successful in the markets { Stock & Futures ) you must jearn to interpret how the public's opinions
art being manipulated and then you must form the opposite opinion,

“ When an option appears to have lost any ability to rally, you should pay close atication to iL It is from
these lengthy low areas that many of uhe unrealistic large moves star *

* The profit potential La commodity trading is terrific, bur the odds against becoming a successful
Speculator are almost inswmountable. The price actions of futures is 90 highty mampylative that at cnes
a wader hardly kwows whether he ks coming or going. Taking a loss becomes a way of life and a trader
Titerally geis to a point where he will run a¢ the sight of his own shadow. Shakeouu and false starts
invariably make hlm wrong at the right dinte ( and right a1 the wrong tims }, Whal he dunks ig
rationalizing, becomes jnst pla emotionalism.”

*" When the public plays the tables of Las Vegas, they know what they arc op agaloct There remains only
4 dim hope thal lady luck could smule upom them, Bul when people ty to hil the jackpot im the whew
futures, they scricusty think they can do it [n Reno and Las Vegas only the odds are against the public,
On the Chicago Board of Trade and the other exchanges, the cards are stacked against bem as well”

" Fear is yoor worst enemy in the fntores matkets and the manipulstors most powerful weapon. Fear can
come under many different disguises and the masters of manipulation are experts a instilling fears. | now
tealize chat fear of missmg 3 mdave wis primarily iny worst weakness, cinsing me Lo get into the macker
much too often,”

* Ondy enter the tutures markers ater a proper formation such as an accumulation triangle, especially a
flot topped triangle, or a long consolidstion period of many weeks having @ positive resistance level
established to give the false mapcession of the commodity beimg onable > go up. Ifyou are iuciry enough
te have a bottom ( Head & Shoulders or W-Formation ), or a good formation show up once a year among
all these commodities, and play it heavily by buying ou. scale-up durimg Ube early part of the move, you
will become a millionaire in est Ume than I did. Pisying for the small and Intermediate moves is what
killy you."
Chart Patterns

Flat Top Triangle * Bear Trap " - " This type of triangle formathon is what really hums a Bull into a
Bear t their sorrom, To the average wader, il seems obviots thal il can ao possibly go up ¢ false
resistance ). Ironically, if toa many Bears cromd Into an option, they are the very ones who give it the
strength to go far higher when they panic. Purchasing the opdion to cover theiz short sale. From a iniders
viewpoint, ils obvioas that the option can not go up. They do not understand thal when it is obvious to
them, itis obvious to the majority. And except for temporary periods, the majority are always wrong,
becanss the insiders are on the opposing side, as tn a contest. ‘They know what they ave doing and have
‘the power to do it,

Accumulation Trisngle - This type of formation brings a feeling of uncertainty 2s to the direction the
Taarket Pill take a5 the two oposing irend lines { Bulls & Bears ) converge, This uneasiness can be seen as
the formation marures and the commodity becomes less volitile indicating that it is now under
agqumulation. This price action insuils Sar among speculators driving them owt of the option which iy
exactly vrhat Uhe manipulators intended to do, The commodity is now ready (oc a big mave since all the
dead weight has been dumped overboard.

W- Permation ” Donde Botton ” - The technical sirength of this formathon lies in the fact that it
‘creates a public fear that prices wil! contimss lower, They have lost hope in it's abiliry (6 rise and
therefore that’s exactly what happens.

Bead & Shoulders Bottom - This pattern frightens the speculators curiag the first shoulder and head.
During the secound shoulder, icy 9efl out their positions in fear that the price will drop down again,
They have host hope in x's ability to rise,

Bull Flag Formation -" As momentum is gathered { ducing the markup } there ausy soddealy be a one
day rise followed by a sharp setback almost as quickly, giving a weak appearance as if it has gone 100
Wgh Dont jet this fool your, it is wneant to look this way. You and others are considered 1p he excess
baggage; this was meant to dump you averboard and to discourage buying.” This type of formation is
what couses people 10 9¢l/ out their posilions too early as they become fearful of a dig drop. This is how
the price up hard for distribation.

Consolidation patterns - This quiet formation gives the false impression of the commodity being unable
Wo rise, This false resistance hevel and galet action is sneant fo “wear out” the speculators resolve 10 hold a
position in the option. Ii is from these lengthy low consolidation areas that most of the really Lares moves

¥.D. GANN. Ha is reputed to have made $50 million in hig 52-year careet of trading in the
Futures end stock matkets. He started trading with $300 and made over $25,000 in profits in
his first yeer of active trading. He then took $973 and made over $30,000 in the Cotton aar-—
ket in 60 days time, Over a period of years, on each $1,000 be started with, he made profits
of $26,500. A friend said, "He hag made a great dee) of money. | once saw him take $130, and
in tess than a 1 month, cun it up to over $12,000, He bas taken nalf a million dollars out
of the markets in the past few years. He can compound money Faater than any man 1 ever met",
Kia comaodity course and stock market couress sold for $5,000 each in the 1930's.

"As a young man, [ spent 9 wanths working day and night in the Astor Library of Mew
York and in the British Museum of London, going over the records of stock transactions as
fer back ss 1820. Charts sre records of past market movements. The future is but s repeti-
tion of the past; there is nothing new. Ag the Bible says, ‘The thing that hath been, it is —
thet which shall be; and that which ia done is that which shall be done, and there ig no nex
things under the sun’. Knowledge of the markets is more important than money and with proper
knowledge and rules a trader can always make a success in the markets. -

What has happened in past marketa will happen again in the future. Human natute does m~
change and that is ons reason why history repeats, and markets act very much the same under
certain conditions year after ysac and in the various cycle of time. The future is nothing —
but a repeat of the past, and charts are the only guide. Charts are of grest value. Future
morket movements can be forecast dy a study of past history and past movements. Lt is impor-
tant te know whet has happened in the past and for how aany months, for example, isportant —
moves have cum before there wes 8 reection.

{ want ta impress upan you strongly that if you expect to make g success in the matkets_
you myst put in plenty of time studying past price movaments, beacause the more time you put
in, the more knowledge you gain, and the more profits you wili take out later. Tha time spe -
in study of price, time and past market movements, will give you a rich Ceward.

You should keep a YEARLY, MONTHLY and WEEKLY chart. The MONTHLY chart is the most impo
tent chart of all jn determining the asin trend. The next most important chart ig the WEEKLY
chert. You should keep a chart of MONTHLY prices for aa Far back as you cen get them and ther
4 WEEKLY chact anywhere from 6 to 12 months back. Watch for indications of activity on the
MONTHLY and WEEKLY charts. By crossing old tops and showing activity, it is a good time to
buy. Go with the trend, Wait until a market spene 2 definite trend.

if you study MONTHLY and WEEKLY charts you will note the different formations before any
“big advance takes place. Study the bottom formations at #xtrema low levels and note how lo
peices usually remain in the bottom range before the ext advence begins. The big profits are
“made in the runs between accumulation end distribution. Therefore, you make money by waiting
—until 3 market PLAINLY OECLARES [T TREND than by getting in before it starts. When a market.
breaks out of its accumulation zone, it is a safe buy and you should make quick profits, be-*
caus# accumylation has already Laken place.

Tne market advances once it breaks out of the trading range, with a ceiling, top or re-
sistance level, “hen a commodity remaina in 4 narrow trading range or sideways @ove, making
about the game top and bottom levels several times, leave it alone until it shows some def-

“inite move out of this range. After accumulation, with considerable time consumed, the lar-
gest profits are made in the shorteat time period by buying after the breaksway point, then

“a commadity holds for many weeks in @ narrow renge, then crosses tops of previous weeks, the

—trend has changed and you should go with it. The longer the period of time in a narrow range,
the greater the advance. This sideways movement is nearly alwaya accumulation.

_ When a commodity sdvances and crosses the highest price of ite history, it usually in-
dicates higher prices and is safe to buy. "hen tops thet were made yeats previous are cross
_ed, At usvally means that the commodity is going much higher. Therefore, it ia very impor-
tant to watch old price levela. The longer the time thet elepses between the breaking into

new territory the greater the move you can expect, because the accumulated energy aver a ong
petiod will produce @ larger movement than if it only accumulated during a short time period.
Market movemanta of importance, i.e., the long swings, require weeks and months to get ready,

or fot accumulation te be completed. There igs alwsys plenty of ties to buy after the big move
gets under way.

Afker a long period of time when prices advance above old highs or old tops, they are in
a stronger position and indicate higher prices. This is the teagon why you must heave # chart
@ long ways back in order to see what position o commodity is in and at what stege it is. You
should have a MONTHLY chart going back 15 ar 20 yeara s0 you will know where the important .
— tops and bottoms ote. Remember. the old Chinese proverb, “One picture is worth 10,000 words".
You should study the picture of 9 commodity before you make a trade.

- Acquiring knowledge will surely bring success in investment or speculation. After you
have acquired knowledge you will need to learn patience. The velue of patience igs that you
must learn to wait for a DEFINITE INDICATION OF A CHANGE IN TREND before buying or selling.
You must not guess or gamble on hope or fear. You must heve the ability to act and to act
quickly at the right time, acting efter you have acquired knowledge and know it is time to
act. You must have the courage to act. Courage and boldness will come efter you have acquired
knowledge because you will have confidence in proven rules and confidence in your ability-

— Therefore, the acquiring of knowledge will give you the courage for action at the time hen

the ceal opportunity comes.

- The main thing to do is to elways GO WITH THE TREND and never buck the trend, regard~
less of how @uch capital you have. By trading with the main trend, you make greater profits.
NEYER GUESS--LET THE MARKET TELL ITS OWN STORY! Guy or seli only on rules and definite indi-
cations. Stocks move faster at higher levels than they do at low levels. Therefore, as 4
general rule, you can make the most money by buying calla on stocks selling between $75 and
$150 per share. Remember stocks are never too high ta duy as long as the trend is up. Buy
stocks im strong position. Always go with the trend. But do not overlook the fact that you
— must use a stop loss for your protection. You must trade in such & wey that you will not be
disturbed mentally by a logs, if Lt comes. You can always Find new opportunities, so jong 8S
you have capital to operate with.

TIME is a most important Factor in forecasting market movements and by studying the past
records of markets you will be able to prove for yourself that history does repeat and that
by knowing the past you can tell the future. The ancient hunters had ¢ rule that when they
were searching to locate an gnimal ln this end, they always followed hls tracks BACKWARD.
Figuring that it was the shortest route to hig lair. The quickest way for you to learn how

i
to determine FUTURE market movements is to study the PAST. .
it takes time to sccumulate 9 comacdity after # prolonged decline. Sy studying tne re.
ord of past movements, you can tell about the time required st the bottom before eB big chanc
in trend should take piace. When you leern the past history of a commodity, learn tne way —
is running, what cycle it is in, and then maka 9 trade on definite knowledge, your chances
for success are 100% greater. The wast money is made when fast moves end extreme Pluctuattor
oceut at the end of major TIME cycles. Everything movea in cycles as a result of the natural
law of action and reaction. By a study of the pest, you will discover what cycles repeat j
the Future. [n order to be accurete in foreceating the futute, you ust know the major cyc..
when peices teach bottom, as a rule, a sefies of rapid fluctuetions take place; then the m
kat gradually narrows down and laya the foundation far another important gove up. ~

When 6 stock advances to a new high level or crosseg 3 former old top by } points, ther
af it i9 going higher, it should not react beck 3 points below the former ald Algh, When ~—
atock advances into new hiatorical high territory, tt ususily indicates higher prices and
safe to buy. Lf it is going higher the stock seldom reacta 3 pointa under the old bigh leve.

Sert Castles, a large operator, made money and kept it. How did Castles do it? When F
bought he alweys placed a stop Ings order on stocks not more than $ points away. This iimi-.
his loss if he was wrong. When he waa right, he let his profita run until he had a definite
reason to cash in. Successful investors have definite plans and rules, and follow thea, S~
ceseful tradere buy at the right time. They knew when to take profits. They did not overtr
--they knew the unexpected could happen, and they sold when everybody else naa buying and
bought when everyone else wae selling. These are the teasons that they made a success and +
net go broke. They used stops in case they ware wrong and took a small loss. And they had
patience to wait for opportunities and to buy and sell at the right time. They followed rux

For a trader to succeed, he must do the opposite of what ha finda the gemeral public -
ing. “hen extremes occur and everybody is radicaily bearish and cen gee no hope for price:
ever edvencing, thet is the time to ga against human nature and follow the charts for the
main swing. For instance, the longer a market advances, especially when the main trend is—
For weeks oc months, the stronger it gets and the smaller the reactions in the lest stege
because in these last stages, hope gives way to euphoria. When market la advancing, hope
and optimism increase to the Limit and traders buy, nok using sound judgment, but buying an
hope. This is the way the public trades. To make a success you must follow rules and trad
opposite to the general public. You're in bad company, when the public ig with you on a li-
scale. .

It always happens that the higher stock prices go, the more pacple want to buy. This
causes 3 Final grend rush and a rapid advance in the last stages of a bull market. History
repeats on Wall Street and what has happened in the past will happen egein in the future. —
Stock market campaigns move in 3 to 4 seckione or waves. Never consider thet the market h ©
Teached final top when it makes the first section in a move up, because if it is a real bu.

cumulated forces are let loose, they aove very rapidly until the enetgy is exhausted and th
time is yp. Guard sgain the human elament...don’t become impatient...don"t be guided by y(—
emotions. The big money is made in the last stage of a bull market when prices are feveri: |
ly active. But cemembet that sharp reactions Follow from tops where there 15 a final grand
rush after a fast move op. In Hheat bull markets, when it comes to the finish or fingl gt™4
rush end ceaches the boiling poant, there is a very fast move up. My rule is, wait ta sel
your Wheat until it bowls. Most grains Finish » bull merket campaign with a fast advance, ~
lasting 6 or 7 weeks, sometimes aS much as 10 weeks, moving up very fast. Remember one thir
prices sre never so high but what they can go higher as long as the trend ia up. Hy tule i
to go with Ene trend and only change when the primary trend changes.

Commodities are much easier to forecast than stocks, because commodities always move™
with supply and demand--this 19 not alweys true with stocks. Commodities offer gteatet oP -
12

tunities for profit than stocks. You can forecast tops and bottoms of commoditias with great-
“er eattainty then atocks. Commodities move faster and are more intereating then stocks. Mot-
able speculators like Livermore, Armour, Patten end Crawford, have discovered after lo
petience that they can make money with greater certainty in coamadities than stocks. Your
—nercentage of gain is much greater in comuodities than in stocks, Let me cite two examples [
«now of petsonally. Eugene Scales and Jordan of New Orleans started with £300 ano $500, ra-
spectively, ya#ars apert, and both ren it up into @ fortune of millions in the Cotton market_
_ There ace many similar examples.

The best kind of markets to trade in ate those that sre active and, according to past
movements, follow the rules and a definite trend. 1 have always made s success trading in
“wctive, fast-moving markets. The big money is always made in treding markets that fluctuate
avet a wide range. Wide swings give great opportunities for making money. Soybeans should re-
main "king" for a long time to come and offet some unusual money-making opportunities. The

~best way to trade and the most money 16 made in long-pull trades, that is, following 4 def-
inite trend o6 long as the trend is up, Hy experience has proved that it is more profitable
to trade in commodities then stocks, and you can make larger profits on the same amount of ,

_capitai with smaller risk. When you trade in commodities, you are trading in the necessities
of life~-commadity prices obey the law of supply ond demand.

The greatest opportunities for profits occur at the end of the great time cycles when
“edvances are very rapid and you can make large profits in a short period of time. It is im-
foctant to note whether a commodity is agking lowsr tops each year. If @ commodity has tade
a lower top each year for 5 years, then makes a higher top than the previous year, it is @

--sign of reversal and indicates a long up cycle. Monthly moves can also be determined and

. forecested by this same rule. You will always make the greatest profits by following the main
trend and playing the long swing. You can never meke money jumping in end out of a market.

_The big @oney is always made by following the main trend. It is much better to make Zora
trades each year and make large profits most of the time, than it ia to try to make dozens
of trades and be wrong holf the time, and make small profita on your winners, and end up
with a net loss.
Pytamiding. Be careful about pyremiding at the wrong time. Wait until the steck of commodity
is vaty active and has crossed resistance levels before buying more. It is always safer to.

_—pyramid after a market moves out of an accumulotion zone. Select stocks with small nuaber of
shares outstending to pyramid. Select commodities that show strong uptrends te pyremid.

The ptoper way to trade is to go with the trend, end pyramid while you are making prof-
its. In pyramiding, your first risk should be your greatest. Suppose on your first trade,
you risk $900. If tha trade moves $500 im your favor, you can then buy & second lot and
place a stop loss order $500 away. And if it is cevght, you will still be only $500 loser,
—because you will be even on your First trade. Once a market gets anay from the accumulation
period and the trend ia well-defined up, reactions ets usually amall. Wait until prices
ctoss 4 previous top before buying 4 second lot.
There are two methods of pycamiding. One is to buy. more just aa soon as the market
breaks into new territory or makes @ new high. In a fast-runming market, you can continous to
_. buy every 10 or 20 points up when the market is moving in your favor. Hy method is to .
determine the reaction levels and how many paints a market has reacted from temporary top
bevels, Find out whether these reactions are running 10 or 20 points; then buy your Ist. ind,
3td or Sth lot For pyremiding on reactions from the tops, waiting 10 or 20 paints according
“to the past reactions. My time cule, whach will help you in pyramiding, 19 to determine the
time of the first isportant reaction, There are many examples of a market reacting aniy 2 to
3 weeks From the time it started up and was good to buy every time it reacted 2 to 3 weeks
— from any top, until at made the fina] top in a big bull market. Determining the time af the
reactions and measuring them this way will greatly incresse your profits and enable you to
follow the main trend of the market, sometimes for @ year or more. Never start to pyramid
__sfter a long advance, The chahess are against you. Begin pyramiding when the trend first
turns up. Many a trader has begun at the dottom of a bull market to trade conservatively aod
accumulated a lacge amount of profits. Finally he begins ta pyramid too heavily and too fast
13

near the top, with the result that when the trend turns he gets caught overloaded and loses
all the profits he has made. Sed experience hes taught me thet it is better to be safe the
sorry. In pytamiding, let “safety first" be your motto.

A pyramid should always be followed up with a stop loss order, no matter hat method ~
use, because your profits must be protected. The more profits you have, however, the more
room you can give the market to fluctyate, or have ita revetse moves or reactions, that is,
you can place your stop toss further away from the market so that s natural reaction will o
disturb your pyramid. for example, suppose you have followed @ market up and have a 100 gx
profit on your original purchase. If the market hag had @ previous reaction of, say, 20
points, it could again react 20 points without changing the main trend, therefore your atop
loss could be 25 points under the market, because if it was ceught, you would not be losir
part of your cepital, but only a pert of your paper profite--while in the eatly stages of
your pyramid your atop loss would have to be closer in order ta prokect your original capit
These pyramiding cules, like other rules, work best on active, high-priced stocks or activ:
-teaded commodities and should only be applied in these types of markets.

{t is impertant to know how and when to pytamid. When a stock is at low levels, betwee
20 and 50, you can buy every 5 points up, that ia, when you have 5 points’ prafit on the
first trade. Buy an additional amount end place a stop so thet you will not have any logs
on the two trades if the market should reverse and catch the stop, When ¢ atock is selling
between 80 and 200, you should only buy 10 points apart. After you make the firat commitm
then wait until you have 10 points’ profit, then buy a second lat. After you have bought 3
4th or Sth lot in a pyramid, then you should decrease the trading unit. For example, if you
have been buying 200 shares each $ or 10 points up and have accumulated 1,000 shares, then
it ia safer to reduce your trading to 100 shares evaty 5S or 10 points up. The big money i:
made by alusys following the mein trend of a stock, Never buy a second lot unless the firs.
trade has moved in your favor. _
Protecting @yramided Profits. Suppose ¢ stock bresks aut on the upside, moves up fast and
shows uptrend. You bought call optiana and have profits in them the first month. The trend
still shows up and when ik crosses previous tops or resistance levels, then you buy more —
cells the mext month. You cam now protect the profits that you heave by buying put options
under the market, Many traders do this when a move of 50 or 60 points takes plece in 2 or 3
months, Frey continue to buy calls every month and then often buy puts to protect their —
profits insteag of placing stop losa orders, thus meking 5 lerge amount of profit on a vei
small risk. Suppose you have bought a Callan a stock at 100 and it advances to 110; then
you buy another call st @ higher level, and then buy a put to protect your profit. You can
continue to buy calls and buy puts, pyramiding all the way up, and not gelling until you ~
think the time has come for a change in the main trend. [n Hay, 1937 Douglas Aircraft de-
clined 30 points From the January high, affording excellent opportunities for pytamiding on
the way down and staying short after you once had s profit in the put and a chance to proba
it with o call. The percentage of profits to the risk wag enormous.

Trading Rules. Yhen you learn the rules and foilow them, you eliminate trading an haope, fea
and guesswork. Bo not Follow “inside information"--1f you do, you wiki Fail. Your success
pends an knowing the right kind of tules and following them. [n order to make a success 2!
trading the metkets, the trader must have definite cules and follow them. Then speculation
can de made a profiteble profession. [rading in commodities is not a gambling business, a
some people think, but s practical, safe business when conducted on business principles.
Like me, | know that anyone can make 3 success, if they follow rujes. [hese cules have cost
me 50 years of experience and hundreds of thousands of dollars to leara., You can make prot
by strictly adhering to these rules. Make up your mind, if you ace NOT going to follow cu
don’t trade. I have made a success and you, ton, can make plenty of profits out of the coe-
modity markets, if you study hacd engugh. The markets can be beaten and there ta big moner
‘operating in commodities if you follow the cules. Here are the cules you must observe:

1, NEVER RISK MORE THAN 10% OF YOUR CAPITAL ON ANY ONE TRADE. The First and most important

thing ta kaaw when you start to trada is the amount of capital required that will enable “

to trade end never lose your capital. if you always have copitsl to start trading again, '
14

can recoup any Losses and make money, But if you risk ali of your capital on one or tuo

_trades and lose it, then the chances are ageinat you. “Safety first” io the rule to apply.
thetever amount of capital you use to trade with, divide it up inte 10 equel perta and never
tisk more than 10% on any one trade. Should you lose for 3 consecutive times, then ceduce
your trading unit and only risk 10% of your remaining capatal. [f you follow this ruls, your

-suceass i4 sure. In this way you will be sble to make 10 consecutive trades on your capital
and the markets would heve Co best you 10 straight timeg to wipe out your capital, which
they will aat do.

“2. NEVER OVERTRADE. The geeatest and most important thing a trader myst learn is that the
unexpected can and often does happen.

“3. ALWAYS BUY AND SELL “AT THE MARKET". Always use “market orders” to buy or sell.

&, FOLLOW UP YOUR TRADES WITH A STOP LOSS ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR PAOFITS.

~

5. ACCUMULATE A SURPLUS AFTER EACK WINNING STREAK.

6. HAVE PATIENCE. Never get inte a trade becsuse you are tired of waiting. Never get out of
a trade just because you have lost patience. Patience ia ona of the very important qualifi-
cations for succeas. In sum, you must have the patience to wait for the right opportunities;

_then you must have the patience to get in right; then you must have the patience to hold on.

7. NEVER TAKE SMALL PROFITS. You aust hold on untess your stop is hit.
8. NEVER BUY JUST @ECAUSE THE PRICE 1S LOW. a

9. ACT AT THE RIGHT TIME. Have the nerve to “pull the trigger’--ta buy and sel} at the right

—time. Knowledge gives you netve, makes you bold and enables you to act at the proper time.
When you fail to buy oc 6ell at the right time, you become afraid--and Fear ig a a datriaen-
tal trading influence.

“10. TIME TO STAY OUT OF THE MARKETS. Important: you cannot trade continuously, There ate
times you should stay out of the markets, There are mony times it will pay you to keep on
the sidelines and wait for a reel opportunity, which is sure to come if you wait.

Remember that a]l the rules work best when markets are near extreme high or eatreme low
levels. Changes in trend which oecur between extreme high and low do not mean as much as a
_teversal when prices are near extreme high and extreme low points. Have the patience to wait
for the choice opportunities to buy and sell at the right tame. Don’t delay of bacome inpe-

tient. Trust me wen I say these rules are vital to your success.

—In conclusion. Always remember that nerve is the equal of capital. In getting ay initial
trading experience, I have been broke many times, i.e., | have lost all of my money, but
there never has been a time yet when [ lost ay nerve. [ always baliave in facing the future

—with nerve and hope. | always had the nerve to pyramid and press a market when my forecast ~
ing science showed that I was on the right side. One successful trader, who Followed scien-
tafe Forecasting methods, never makes more than > or 6 trades in a year. He only qoes after

_the main swings and he follows it up and pycamads when the advance materializes as ne expec-
ted. Great and unusual oppartunlties, when you cam start at the bottom of a move, pytamid
and make a fortune, occur every couple of years. If you are able to catch half of these @8-
jor maves on consetvative trades, your profits wil) be enormous. Do mot try to catch the #1-

“hor moves. Make speculation a business, nat 9 gamble. Be patient. Be conservative. If big
cisks are required, do mot make the trade. Walt for a genuine opportunity where you can Duy
and pyramid with a minieum of risk.” :

WILLIAM D. GANN

An Operator Whose Science and Ability Place Him: in the Front Rank—
His Remarkable Predictions and Trading Record,

OMETIME ago the attention of
this zing was aitracted by
certain jong pull stock market
redictions which were being made by
iam D, Gann. Ina ¢ number
of.cases Mr, Gann gave us sn advance
the exact points at which certain stocks
and commodities would sell, together
with prices close to the then prevailing
figures whick would not be touched,

For instance, when New York Cen-
tral was 131 he predicted that it would
sell et 148 before 129.

So repeatedly did his Ggures prove
ta be accurate, and so different did his
work appear from that of any expert
whose methods we had examined, that
we sel about to investigate Mr. Gann
thd his way of figuring out these pre-
dictions, as weil ag the particular us¢
which he was making of them in the
inark:

et.

The results of this investigation are
remarkable in many ways.

lt appears to be a fact Shat Me.
Gann has developed an‘ entizely new
idea as to the principles verming
stock macket movements. ¢ bases
his operations upon cestain natural
Jaws, which, though existing since the
world began, have only in recent years
been subjected ta the will of man, and
added to the list of so-called modern
discoveries.

We have asked Mr. Gann for an
outline of his work and have secared
tome remarkable evidence as to the
cesults obtained therefrom. We submit
this in full recognition of the fact that

in Wall Street a man with a new
idea—an idea which violates the tra-
ditions and encourages a scientibe view
of the proposition—is not uscally wel-
comed by the majority, for the reason
that he stimulates thought and re-
Search. These activities said majority
abhors,

_ Me, Gann’s description of his exper-
ieace and methods is given herewith
it should be read with a recognition
of the established fact that Mr. Gann’s
predictions have proved correct in a
lai majority of instances.

“For the past ten years 7 have de-
voted my entire time and attention to
the speculative markets. Like many
others, 1 lost chonsands of dollars and
experienced the usual ups and downs
incidentat 10 the movice who enters
the market without preparatory knowl-
¢e of the subject.

T soon began to realize that all
successiu)] men, whether lawyers, doc-
tors, o¢ scientists, devoted years of
time to the study and investigation of
their particular pursuit or profession
hefore altempting to make any money
our of it

“Being in the brokerage business
myself and handling large accounts, I
had opportunities setdom affurded the
ordinary maa for studying the cause
of success and failare in ihe specula-
tions of others, [ found that over
hinety per cemt of the waders who go
into the market withoue knowledge o¢
study usually lose in ¢he end.

“1 soon degan to note the periodical

hc bas a firm grasp of the basic
principles which govern stock market
hiovements, and | do not believe any
other man on earth can duplicate the
idea or his method at the present time.

“Karly this year he figured that the
top of the advance would fall on a
certain day in August and calculated
the prices at which the Dow-Jones
averages would then stand. The mar-
ket culminated on the exact day and
within four-tenths of one per cent. of
the figures predicted.”

"You and Mr. Gann must have
cleaned up considerable money on all
these operations,” was suggested,

"Yes, we have nade a t deal
of fioney, He has taken half 2 million
dollars out of the market in the past
few years. 1 once saw him take $130,
and in ess than one nsonth run it up
lo cover $1200, Ile can compound
money faster than any man | ewer
met.” :

“One of the most astonishing cal-
culations made by Bir. Gaan was dur-
ing last summer (3909) when he pre-
dicted that September wheat would
selt at $120. ‘This meant that it must
touch that figure before the end of
the month September. At twelve
o'clock, Chicago time, on September
30th {the last day) the option was
polling: delow $1.08, and it loaked as
though his prediction would not be
fulfilled, Mr. Gana said ‘If it does
not touch $1.20 by the close of the
masket i¢ will prove that there is some-
thing wrong with my whole method
of calculation. 1 do mot care what the

rice is now, it must go there.’ It
is_ common history that September
wheat surprised the whole country
by selling at $2.20 and no higher in
the very hour of the trading, ctos-
ing at that figure,

So much for what Mc. Gann hag
said and done as evidenced by himself
and others. Now as to what demon-
Strations have taken place before our
representative:

uring the month of October, 1909,
in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann
made, in the presence of our repre-
sentative, two hundred and eighty-six
transactions io various stocks, on both
the long and short side of the market.
Two hundred and sixty-four of these
transactions resulted in profits; ewen-
ty-twa in losses.

The capital with which he operated
was doubled ien times, so that at the
end of the month he had one thousand
ber cent. of his original margin.

Th our presence Mr. Gann sold Steel
<ommon short at 94%, saying that it
would not go 19 95, It did act.

On a drive which occurred during
the week ending Octoher 2th, Mr.
Gann bought Siee? common at 864%,
saying thal it would not go to. 86.
The lowest it sold was 86

We have seen him give in one day
sixteen successive orders in the satne
stock, eight of which turned out to be
tither the top or the bottom eighth of
that patticular swing, The above we
tan positively verify.

Such performances as these, coupled
with the foregoing, are probably un-
paralleled in the history of the Street

James R. Keene has said, “The man
who is right six times out of ten will
make his foctune.” Here is a trader,
who, without any attempt to make a
showing (ier be did not know the
results were to be published), estabiish-
ts @ recotd of over ninety-two per cenl
profitable trades. :

Mr. Gana haa refused to disclose
bis method at any price, but to those
scientifically inclined he has unques-
Honably added to the stock of ait
Street Imowledge’ and painted oul
infinite possibill . |

¢ have requested My, Gann to
figure out for the readers SPhe Tick-
er a few of the most striking indica-
tions which appear in his calculations.

In presenting these we wish it under-
stood that oo man, jin or out of Wall
Stree, is infatlible.

Mr. Gann’s figures at present indi-
cate that the tcend of the stock mar-
ket should, barring the usual rallies,
be toward tower prices until March
or April, 1910,

He calcolates that May wheat, which
is now selling a1 $1.02, should not sell
below 9c, and should sell at $1.45 next
apring,

On cotton, which is now at about
the l5e, ievel. he estimates that, alter
a good reaction from these prices, the
commodity should reach I8c. in the
spring of 1910. He looks for a corner
in the March or May option,

Whether these figures prove correct
or not, will in no sense detract from
the record which Mr, Gann has al-
ready established,

Mr, Gann was born in Lufkin, Tex-
a6, and is thirty-one years of age. He -
is a gifted mathematician, has an ex.
traordinary memory for fi res, and
an expert Tape Reader. Teke away
his science and he wauld beat the

orbit, just as the advancing year ever
brings the rose of spring, so do the
properties of the elements periodically
recut, a8 the weight of the atoms
tises. . . .

“From my extensive investigations,
siudics and applied tests, 1 God that
not only do the vacious stocks vibrate,
but that the driving forces controiling
the stocks are also in a state of vibra-
tion These vibratory forces can only
be known by the movements they
generate on the stocks and their val-
ucy in the market. Since all great
swings ot movements of the market
are cyclic they act in accordance with
the periodic law.

*Science has laid down ihe principle
that ‘the properties of an element are
@ periodic function of its atomic
weight’ A famous scientist has stat-
ed that ‘we are brought to the con-
vietion that diversity in phenomenal
nature ia its different kingdoms, is
most intimately associated with numer-
ical relationship. The numbers are not
intermixed, chaotically asd accidental-
ly, but are subject to regular period-
icity, The changes and developments
are also seen to be in many cases
undulatory.’

“Thus, [ aGiem, every class of phe-
nomena, whether in nature or in the
stock market, must be subject to the
universal Sew of camsation and her-
mony. Every effect must have an
adequate canse.

“If we wish to avert failure in spec-
ulation we shust deal with causes.
Everything in existence is based on tx-
act pro jon and perfect relationship.
There is no chance in nature, because
mathematical principies of the highest
order fie at the foundation of all things.
Faraday said: "There is nothing in the
Universe but mathematical points of
force."

“Vibration is Yondamental; sothing
Is exempt from this law; it is univer-
zal, therefore applicable to every class
af phenomena on the globe.

Srhrough the Law of Vibration ev-
ery stock in the market moves in its
own distinctive sphere of activities, a6
to intensity, volume and direction; all
the essential qualities of ita ¢volution
are characterized in its own rate of
vibration, Stocks, like ators, ace real-
ly centers of energies, therefore they
are cantrolled mathematically. Stocks
ereate their own field of action and
power; power to attract and repel,
which principle explains why certain
stacks at times lead the market and

.ations of Me.

$

‘turn dead’ at other times. ‘Thus to
speculate scientifically it is absolutely
necessary to follow natural law.

“After years of patient study 1 have
proven to my entire satisfaction as
well as demonstrated to others that
vibration explains every possible phase
and condition of the market.”

In order to substantiate Mr, Gann‘s
claims as 1o what he bas been able to
do under this method, we called upon
Mr. William E, Gilley, an Inspector
of Imports, 16 Beaver steel, New
York, Mr. Gilley is well-known in
the down-town district. He himself
has studied stock market movements
for twenty-Gve years, during which
time he has examined every piece
af market literacure that has been
issued and procurable in Wall Street
Ie was he who encouraged Mr. Gann
to study out the scientifc and math-
ematical possibilities of the subject.
Wher asked what bad been the most
impressive of Mr, Gann's work and
predictions, he repli¢d as follows:
“Te is wery dificult for me to re
member afl the predictions and oper-
ann which may be
classed as phenomenal, but the follow-
ing are a few: lo 1908 when Union
Pacific was 168% he told me thal
it would not touch 169 before it had 2
good break. We sold it short all the
way down to 152%, covering on the
weak spots and putting it out i
on the rallies, securing twenty-three
points profit ont of an cighteen-point
move,

“He came to me when United States
Steel was selling around $0 and grid
‘This Steel will run up to 58 but il
will not sell at 59. From there it should
break 16% points, We sold it short
around 58% with a stop at $9. The
highess it went was . From there
it declined to 41%—1744 points.

“At another time wheat was selling
al about 89c, He predicted that the
May option would sell at $1.35, We
bought it and made large profits on
Si asyy up. Te actually touched

“When Union Pacific was 172, he
said it would go to 184% but not an
eighth higher until it had had a good
break. It went to 184% and came
back from there eight.or nine times.
We sold it shart repeatedly with @
stop at 185 and were never ae
Tt eventually came back to 172%.

“Mr, Gann’s calculations are based
on natural law. 1 have foflowed hit
work closely Jor years. [ know thal

recurrence of the rise and fail in stocks
and commodities. This led me to con-
clude that natural law was the basis of
markel movements. 1 then decided
to devote ten years of my life to the
study of natural law as applicable to
the speculative markets and to devote
my Iust chergies wward making spce-
ulation a profitable professia After
exhaustive ressarches and investiga-
lions of the knows sciences, 1 discov-
ered that the Law of Vibration cn-
abled me to accurately determine the
exact points to which slocks or com-
modities should rise and fall within a
given time, The working out of this
law delermines the canse and predicts
the effect jong before the Street is
aware of either, blost speculators can
testify to the fact that it is looking
at the effect and ignoring the cause
that has produced their losses.

“it is impossible here to ave an ade-
quate idea of the Law of Vibration
as E apply it to the markets, however,
the layman may be able to Erasp some
of the principles when I stale ghar the
Law of Vibration is the fundamental
Taw upon which wireless telegraphy,
witeless telephones and phanographs
are based Without the existence of
this law the above inventions would
have been impossible,

“In order to test out the efficiency
of my idea I have not only put in
years of labor in the regular way, but
T spent nine months working night
and day in the Astor Library of New
York and in the British Museum of
London, going over the records of
stock transactions as far back at 1820,
T have incidentally examined the ma-
oipulations of Jay Gould, Daniel Drew,
Commodore Vanderbilt and all the
other important Wall Street manipu-
lalors from that time to the present
day. I have examined every quotation
of Union Pacibe prior ta and from
the time of E, H. Harriman’s securing
control, and can gay that of all the
manipulations in the history of Wall
Street. Me. Harriman’s was the most
masterly, The figures show that,
whether unconsciously oc not, Mr.
Harriman worked strictly in accord-
ance with nalural Jaw,

“In going over the history of mar-
kets and the great mass of related sta-
listics, it soon becomes apparent that
certain Jaws govern the changes and
Variations in the value of stocks and
there exists a periodic -or cyctic law,
which is at the back of all these move-
ments. Observation has shown that

there are regular periods of intense
activity on the Exchange followed &
periods of inactivity. Mr. Henry Hal
In his recent book devoted much space
to ‘Cycles of Prosperity and Depres-
sion’ which he found recurring at
regular intervals of time. The law
which [ have applied wilt net only give
these jong cycles or swings, but the
daily and even hourly movenens of
siocks. By knowing the exact vibra~

“Those in close touch with the
markets have noticed the phenomena
of ebb and flow, or rise and fall in
the valve of stocks. AL certain times
a2 stock will become intensely active,
large transactions being made¢ in it;
at other times this same stock will
hecome practically stationary or indc-
tive with a veey small volume of aates.
I have found that the Law of Vibra-
tion governs and controls these condi-
tions. 1 have also found that certain
phases of this law govern the rise in
a stock and an entirely different euie
operates on the decline.

“While Union Pacific and other rail-
road stocks which made their high
prices in August were declining, United
States Steel common was steadily ad-
vancing, The Law of Vibration was
at work, sending a particular stock on
the upward trend, whilst others were
trending dowoward,

“i have Joond that in the stock it-
self exists its harmonic or inharmoni¢
relationship 10 the driving power or
force behind it, The secret of all its
activity is therefore apparent Hy my
method I can determine the vibration
of each stock and dy also taking cer-
tain time values into consideration I
can in the majority of cases tell exact-
ly what the etock will do under given
conditions,

"The power ¢a determine the trend
of the market is due to my knowle
of the characteristics of each individ-
ual stock and a certain grouping of
different stocks under their proper
rates of vibration, Stocks are fike
electrons, atoms, and molecules, which
hold persistently io their own individ-
uality in response to the fundamental
Law of Vibration, Science teaches
‘that an original impulse of any kind
