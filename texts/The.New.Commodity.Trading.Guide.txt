This book is sold with the understanding that neither the author nor the publisher is engaged in rendering financial, investment, legal,
accounting, or other professional services or advice by publishing this book. Each individual situation is unique. Thus, if legal or
financial advice or other expert assistance is required in a specific situation, the services of a competent professional should be
sought to ensure that the situation has been evaluated carefully and appropriately. The author and the publisher disclaim any liability,
loss, or risk resulting directly or indirectly, from the use or application of any of the contents of this book.
Before you trade with real money, familiarize yourself with the risks.
Important Risk Disclosures: Commodity futures trading is speculative, involves substantial risks, and you should invest only risk capital.
You can lose a substantial amount or all your investment, and therefore you should carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your
financial condition.
The high degree of leverage that is obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you—the use of leverage can lead to large losses as
well as large gains.
If the market moves against your position, to maintain your position you may on short notice be called upon by your broker to deposit additional margin
money. If funds are requested, and you do not provide them within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for
any resulting deficit in your account. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for
example, when the market makes a “limit move.” The placement of contingent orders, such as a “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” order, will not necessarily limit
your losses to the intended amount.
There is no guarantee that the concepts presented in this book will generate profits or avoid losses.

     Going the Way of the Dodo


“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds,
while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.”
—Charles Mackay, 1841, Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness
of Crowds

     The dodo, a flightless bird, has been extinct since the 17th century.
        According to Wikipedia, the verb phrase to “go the way of the dodo” means
     to become obsolete, to fall out of common usage, or to become a thing of the
     past. The dodo is considered the poster child for an extinct species because its
     demise was directly attributable to human activity. (They were good to eat and
     easy to catch.)
        Have you ever wondered whether the last dodo bird was aware of being the
     very last one?

         On the first trading day of 2008, the price of crude oil easily exceeded $99
     per barrel, due to a Nigerian rebel attack on oil-producing facilities. The rumor
     circulating trading desks globally was that this would be the day—the first day
     in history that oil prices would trade at that psychological stratospheric barrier
     of $100 per barrel.
         I was watching the oil market that day and saw it approach $100, but it never
     quite reached it. The market traded at a new all-time high of approximately
     $99.80 but then ran out of steam and rolled over. Oil prices continued trading
     lower just as I received a “Breaking News” e-mail from Marketwatch that read:
     “Oil trades at $100 for the first time ever.” I turned to my assistant and asked
     her what she showed as the high crude oil price. “It’s $99.81,” Nancy told me.
     “Last print, $99.50.” So I looked at the other delivery months, but they were all
     trading at a discount—not even close to $100. I thought to myself, they just got
     it wrong this time.
         That night, I was watching the evening news on NBC and the anchor
     reported: “Oil in New York traded today, for the first time ever, at $100 per
     barrel.” “How could they all get this so wrong?” I thought. Then it dawned on




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    me. Like most traders, I was watching the electronic oil market where more than
    99% of all trades take place. I didn’t think to check the pit market that hardly
    anyone traded on or looked at anymore. Sure enough, “the pit” had recorded a
    different high than “the screen”—exactly $100 per barrel. The wire services had
    picked up on this feat and reported it as headline news around the world. Of
    course, this raised the question, why would anyone pay more than the market
    when they could have easily bought at the screen price? The pit trade is fast
    disappearing because it’s slower than electronic trading. Was this merely an
    aberration?
        The next day, the full story came out. On January 2, 2008, 747,748 one-
    thousand-barrel contracts changed hands, with 99% of them trading on the
    screen and just one of those contracts trading at the price of $100. This lone
    contract changed hands (as we had already discovered) in the pit. I really
    wouldn’t call this a “legitimate” trade, even though an exchange spokesman
    called it just that in a press release the following day. The man behind this record-
    high price was an anonymous professional pit trader. Did he make a mistake?
        No, he knew exactly what he was doing. This guy was willing to lose $300
    for bragging rights. The BBC subsequently termed this a “vanity trade.” He
    absolutely overpaid for the right to tell his grandkids, “I was the first person in
    history to buy $100 oil.”
        This “achievement” will no doubt turn out to be one of the last hurrahs of
    the pit trader. Electronic trading is faster, cheaper, more efficient, and, in
    certain ways, more honest than having market makers take the other side of a
    trade. These are the reasons why the pit trader is fast “going the way of the
    dodo,” and as with that tasty flightless bird, the pit trader’s demise is directly
    attributable to human activity.


        It’s Different This Time?
    As you read The New Commodity Trading Guide, be aware that “New” will
    always be in the title whenever you read this. So at what point does this book
    become similar to the pit trader—obsolete and no longer “new”?
        The book presents commodity trading in a new light because I believe the
    commodity markets perform differently today than any time before. During
    most of my career, which spans more than 30 years, futures trading was viewed
    as a casino. Now many financial planners treat commodities as an asset class,
    and they allocate a portion of their portfolios to commodities alongside tradi-
    tional stocks and bonds. Then consider the electronic factor that has dramati-
    cally changed the way the markets behave. Add in increased demand from the




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
Introduction                                                                          3




emerging economies, the hedge funds and the index funds, and you’ve planted
the seeds for change. Because the commodity markets act differently now, new
techniques are required for trading success. Still, it’s important to remember
that these four words—“it’s different this time”—have collectively resulted in
more lost money for more traders than any others.
    A few years after the 1929 stock market crash, the great trader and philan-
thropist Bernard Baruch wrote a foreword to a reprint of Charles Mackay’s
classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Originally
published in 1841, Mackay’s book chronicled various investment manias from
the 1500s through the 1800s. From the tulip craze to the Mississippi and South
Sea Bubbles, the basic underlying premise was that manias (economic and
otherwise) are a condition of the human species. They will come and go over
time but never disappear. My reprinted edition of Popular Delusions was
published in October 1932, right in the thick of the Great Depression. In this
quote from the foreword, Baruch refers to that most recent mania he termed the
“1929 market madness in America”: “I have often thought that if, in the lamen-
table era of the ‘New Economics,’ culminating in 1929, even in the presence of
dizzily spiraling prices, we had all continuously repeated, ‘two and two still
make four,’ much of the evil might have been averted.” Those very words could
be used today; just substitute the dates.
    The 1929 panic and eventual recovery from the Great Depression that
followed were not firsts for America. Crashes and market panics occurred in
1837, 1857, 1861, 1873, 1893, 1901, and one could make a case for 2008 as
well. The 1857 panic was preceded by the California gold rush. The 1873 panic
was preceded by a speculatively induced bubble in railroad stocks. The panic of
2008 was preceded by a speculative boom in housing prices that created the
subprime debacle. Still, more has been written about the 1929 crash than any
other crash in history because more people in the newly minted middle and
upper classes were affected, and also because few people saw it coming. People
held a widespread belief at that time in the “new economics”: A period of
permanent prosperity had arrived. Certainly, the 1920s was an unprecedented
period of prosperity, with new wealth created from the automobile industry and
the accompanying boom in road building and travel. A plethora of new
technologies and new household electronic appliances, such as the radio, were
born. To top it all off, the 1920s saw the creation and widespread use of
installment credit products. Perhaps this was one of the main unsung underlying
causes of the crash. Looking at modern history, we can point to the dotcom
mania of the late 1990s. In recent years, examples include the condo mania in
Florida and Las Vegas and the subprime housing crisis in California and many

    other places. Obscure manias also pop up nearly every year but fail to reach the
    mainstream media because they affect only a few of those directly involved. (I
    chronicle one of these, with the accompanying valuable lessons, in Chapter 2,
    “Capturing a 5,000% Return,” a recent commodity bubble that ended with the
    inevitable burst.)
        One shared trait of all manias is that the majority of players never see the
    collapse coming. If you read the financial press from 1929 to 1931, all during
    the period the market was falling, respected analysts continually considered it a
    correction that would soon be over. When stocks finally did hit bottom in 1933,
    more than 80% of all value had been lost. Will this be how the current
    commodity boom ends? Will today’s commodity bubble burst? The answer to
    this question is, yes, it certainly will end badly because the history of mankind
    is that all economic bubbles eventually burst. The only question is, when? It will
    take place after any bull market move in a particular commodity market morphs
    into a mania. This will be the time when the general public is totally immersed
    in the story of the day. It’s never “different this time”: It always ends the same
    way—badly for the general public. However, as this is being written, I question
    the premise that, in a macro sense, this commodity bull run is anything close to
    a mania or a bubble. It’s more similar to a balloon, inflating and deflating but
    overall somewhere at the half inflation point. Before the 1929 stock market
    crash, shares in shell companies were being manufactured without economic
    justification, and only because people would buy them. In contrast, commodities
    have intrinsic value and are being consumed by those who buy them.
        So how will we know the final top is in for commodities as an asset class?
        When analyzing any market move for a top, ask yourself whether the market
    you’re looking at is currently spiraling. Does it look similar to a flagpole
    growing up to the sky (which the laws of physics tell us cannot last indefinitely),
    or has it recently been cleansed and purged via a healthy correction? In the
    middle of a move, some of the air (the buying) that was pumped in flows out
    before new air is pumped in. One of my goals for this book is to teach you how
    to recognize the early signs of a new bull run, and also how to recognize the end
    of the run.
        One type of top is the blow-off top, a formation that occurs at the end a
    sustained bull market run. How can you tell if a market is in a blow-off top?
    Close to the end of the move, during the top formation, the market surges
    higher, with only shallow corrections. Compared to the norm, volumes are
    huge. Technical indicators such as the RSI (an oscillator) run up to extremely
    high (overbought) readings, but although these readings appear to be in unsus-
    tainable territory, the market continues moving higher than anyone believed




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

possible. Then you’ll hear outlandish price predictions in the mainstream media,
and talk of shortages will be rampant. The talk will be that the world is going to
run out of this or that. In many cases, the last 48 hours of a major move can be
the most feverish—and the most lucrative for the bulls. This final surge that
forms the actual blow-off is the most painful for the bears. Their capitulation
(short covering) creates the final high prices. Nobody I know of is able to pick
the exact top in a situation such as this. However, in markets that show these
signs, if you have been fortunate enough to be on for some of the ride, it’s time
to be vigilant because the end is near. The top price will come when nobody is
looking and generally when the news is as bullish as it can get.
    Most people will see the first break from the top price as a normal
correction, just a temporary break within a bull that is nowhere close to being
over yet. The market might have a secondary rally after the first break, but then
it will be unable to register new highs. Without most of the players realizing it’s
happening, the air will be let out of the bubble. Then one day it will whoosh.
Bullish news might continue during much of the move back down. At some
point, the bull turns into a bear, the decline accelerates, and ultimately there’s
blood in the streets. This is the time when the news will turn very bearish, there
will be a multiyear surplus of this or that, and it will appear that the bear has
settled in for the long pull. In reality, as only the smart money will see during
blood in the streets, the bear is losing the game and will soon be replaced by a
young bull.
    As this is being written, the macro forces of a continuing global commodity
bull trend appear to remain in force. The balloon is inflating, not deflating. Sure,
there have been, and will continue to be, plenty of healthy corrections along the
way, but consider these merely temporary tops.
    Let’s briefly discuss the fundamentals that lead me to believe this current
commodity bull will be running for quite some time yet. We know explosive
demand growth exists in the developing world, with no easy way to turn this
train around. More than a billion consumers are moving up to a higher level of
consumption, demanding the comforts the West has enjoyed since the third
Industrial Revolution that began in the early 1900s. For many decades, one
billion of Earth’s human inhabitants have consumed two-thirds of Earth’s
developed resources. The other six billion got by on the remaining third. Now,
led by China and India, the developing world is eating better and living better,
and this requires massive commodity consumption. These people are transi-
tioning from being mainly producers to a combination of producers and
consumers. From a macro sense, this places upward pressure on commodity
prices.




                                                                         From the Library of Kerri Ross
6   Introduction




        The magnitude of this unprecedented demand shock is difficult to
    comprehend, as these people drive more cars and consume more protein and
    electric power. Heating, lighting, air conditioning, and appliances require
    power plants. New buildings, roads, ships, ports, trains, trucks, and buses—the
    list goes on. Energy needs, food requirements, textiles, copper to build new
    electrical grids, corn and soybean meal to feed growing populations of pigs,
    chicken, and cattle. Soybeans, cotton, rice, sugar, and corn for food and fuel,
    with more fertilizer needed to grow these crops.
        The global population is growing at 80 million people annually. This is the
    equivalent of adding one Mexico to the world every year. The areas of the world
    with the greatest population percentage increases are moving toward the
    consumption patterns of the developed world. And while all this is taking place,
    the developed world continues to consume. And it’s not just India and China
    that are players in this industrial revolution. Other rapidly emerging Asian
    nations, Eastern Europeans, Russians, and South Americans (with Brazil in the
    forefront) are all creating massive new consumer middle classes. But let’s
    concentrate on China for a few paragraphs.
        As we go to press, the average American is using approximately 25 barrels’
    worth of oil annually. To put this number in perspective, at the conclusion of
    World War II when the Japanese economy was in ruins, the Japanese consumed
    the equivalent of one barrel per capita annually. Now that Japan has become a
    modern industrialized power, the average Japanese person consumes approxi-
    mately 17 barrels of oil annually. A decade ago, the average Chinese person
    consumed about one barrel annually, and now this number is rapidly
    approaching two. What happens when this number doubles again and then
    quadruples? On a daily basis, the world is using all the oil it can produce. For
    example, we have about 900 cars for every 1,000 people in the United States.
    By comparison (and this number is constantly growing and will be outdated by
    the time you read it), only 45 people per 1,000 own cars in China. If vehicle
    ownership there doubles to 90, how will this affect the demand for aluminum
    and rubber in auto manufacturing? China recently surpassed the United States
    as the world’s largest copper consumer. And what about oil? As we know, a
    large percentage of global oil supplies are produced in volatile places. China is
    an oil importer, and as its oil consumption grows, what happens every time a
    disruption occurs due to an outage, pipeline problem, hurricane, war, or some
    political event in a producing country? Chinese per-capita income has risen
    from less than $500 in 1990 to $3,000 in 2008, and Indian per-capita income
    has risen from less than $500 in 1990 to more than $1,000 in 2008. This stimu-
    lates energy demand, not to mention demand for more and better food.

    North American farmers have experienced great growing weather for most
of the past 100 years. This benefit, combined with improvements in agriculture,
has resulted in abundant crops. You have to go back 800 years to find a period
of such favorable weather for such a long time. Yet as 2008 has shown, we know
what can happen to the price of wheat, for example, if a few crop failures occur
around the world—prices can easily triple. Considering how good weather has
generally been during the past two decades; food stocks in corn, wheat,
soybeans, and rice seem to remain dangerously low year after year. With
another Mexico being added to the world’s population each year, the demand
side of the equation will not solve this problem. With global warming an
impending dilemma for crops, can the world continue to rely on the supply side
growing? When the world again experiences a year of bad weather (whether too
much rain or too little, temperatures too hot or too cold), food prices are set to
surge again.
    Fundamentals are important because they set the tone for commodity price
moves. However, increasingly in this new electronic age, fundamental analyses
will not help you in your trading. The fundamentals for many of the markets we
trade are complex and often conflicting. I’ve designed this book to help the
individual trader. With that in mind, realize that it’s virtually impossible for an
individual to sort through the thousands of statistics that comprise the European
economy to accurately determine the direction the Euro will be moving today.
Many traders have wondered why something like this happens: On the day it
was announced that the supplies of crude oil went down an extremely bullish
five million barrels in the weekly report (and the traders were looking for an
increase), how could the market close lower? Apparently, some hidden evil
fundamental must have been lurking (“evil” because we were long that day) that
caused that crash. As with the European currency, the fundamentals for oil (and
all the other commodities, for that matter) are complex. During any particular
trading session, assembling all the supply and demand data bits into a trading
strategy is impossible. However, you can analyze one dominant fundamental to
achieve profitability.
    George Soros wrote, “The most important fundamental is credit flow”—or
to put this more simply, money. Money flows move markets, and this is the most
important determinant of price action. My premise is that you need to correctly
analyze only this one fundamental to be successful: which direction the money
is flowing. How do we do this? This book addresses that very question. As we
go to press, the time is still ripe to capitalize on the continuing macro bull trend
in commodities. However, when it does finally come to an end, the book won’t




                                                                         From the Library of Kerri Ross
8   Introduction




    be obsolete. My plan is to also help you capitalize on the bear trend, and I
    explore techniques and methodologies—for both scenarios.
        Our topic is as old as the hills. Commodities are necessary for life and
    comfort, and will continue to be traded as long as the human race exists. Every
    economy has experienced long periods of negative growth when commodity
    prices were depressed (as some are today). Then the bull cycles occur. Today the
    current global bull commodity cycle is about a decade old. Mini cycles, such as
    the commodity decade of the 1970s, lasted about ten years. However, long-term
    charts beginning in the 1700s tell us that major bull cycles in commodities
    generally range from 18 to 23 years. For example, as humankind entered the
    twentieth century, the last (the third great) Industrial Revolution lasted nearly
    30 years. How long will this one last? I am a good enough student of mass
    psychology to know that this book will remain popular only as long as
    commodities are in a bull cycle. The public is not interested in bear cycles. So
    perhaps one way to determine whether the globe is still experiencing a bull
    commodity cycle is to ask where you bought (and I do hope you bought) The
    New Commodity Trading Guide? Did you buy it new at full price, or used at a
    discount? The latter might be an indication that this cycle has run its course.
        In my current time frame, as this is being written, America, and by contagion
    much of the globe, is going through a colossal financial crisis. The major invest-
    ments banks of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, both in business for more
    than 100 years, are now both gone. The U.S. government has bailed out Freddie
    Mac and Fannie Mae and taken over AIG, and there will be additional bailouts
    and more money printing ahead of us. It’s a real financial mess, with countless
    paper assets plummeting in value. Although liquidity problems can bleed over
    into commodity values at times, unlike the stock or bond of a failed financial
    entity, commodity prices will always rebound because they are necessary to
    sustain and enhance life.
        I anticipate that commodities will continue to be hot for years to come
    because the world has entered a period of tightening commodity supplies with
    increasing demand. The planet’s resources are limited, and commodities can
    play a role in your asset-allocation decisions. However, if the cycle has run its
    course, realize that bear cycles can be as profitable as their counterpart, and they
    can move much faster. Just follow the money flows.
        Perhaps as you read this, oil use will have been replaced by some alternative
    energy source, but the macro trend of accelerating commodity consumption will
    likely continue unabated. More important, the trend of accelerating power
    usage will continue, and the new challenge will be avoiding power shortages. No
    quick solution exists for electricity shortages, and I anticipate that this will




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
Introduction                                                                              9




become a growing problem as global power demand accelerates. Many of the
best trading opportunities lie ahead of us, but be aware of ebb and flow to all of
this. There’s a time for all things, and one day the bull will lose control and then
the bear will take over. As you read this, I have no way of knowing whether the
bull or the bear is winning the race you choose to join this week.
    Baruch began his 1932 foreword to Popular Delusions by telling us that “all
economic movements, by their very nature, are motivated by crowd
psychology.” This is a truism, but it’s magnified today because the crowd has
grown much bigger than at any time in the history of the human species. When
Baruch wrote his foreword, it was during the depths of the Great Depression.
This must have been a time of deep and total despair for many, yet humankind
always seems to muddle through the bad times, as he so sagely concluded we
would at that time: “Similarly, even in this general moment of gloom in which
this foreword is written, when many begin to wonder if declines will never halt,
the appropriate abracadabra may be: ‘They always did.’”

        1Eliminating People



“Most of the world’s ills would be cured with one three-day open season on people.”
–Ernest Hemingway

“They’re not just getting rich…they’re getting even.”
–Trading Places (1983)

     An electric tension fills the air as Louis Winthorpe, III and Billy Ray Valentine
     muscle their way through the crowd of traders lining the New York Board of
     Trade’s frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) trading pit. The traders are
     sweating from the heat generated by more than 100 tightly packed bodies,
     nervous with the anticipation of what’s to come. The clerks manning the phones
     surrounding the pit are on high alert.
        The crop report will be released in just minutes. When those numbers are
     out, the market will move big time, creating and destroying fortunes in the
     process.
        Winthorpe and Valentine are now standing shoulder to shoulder with other
     traders eyeing their arch nemesis—the ultimate slime ball, Clarence Beeks.
     Beeks believes he already knows the actual crop report numbers. He illegally
     obtained an advance copy of the report in his quest to corner the orange juice
     market on behalf of the infamous Duke Brothers. However, our heroes learned
     of Beeks’s plan: They managed to steal the real crop report back from Beeks and
     secretly delivered him a fake version.




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross
12   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         The “real” crop report will show a record-large orange harvest, resulting in
     huge supplies that will ultimately cause the traders to yell “Sell!” Beeks believes
     the numbers in his false report and will be looking for the orange crop numbers
     to be sharply lower. He is planning to “Buy!” in his quest to corner the orange
     juice market for the Dukes.
         Futures are traded on margin, with only a small deposit required to purchase
     a large amount of an asset. It’s just as easy to short—to sell first and then buy
     back later (hopefully lower)—as it is to be a buyer. Commodities can be very
     volatile, particularly on crop report day.
         The opening bell rings and immediately the decibel level explodes. All trades
     in the pit are made by the “open outcry” process where the traders yell out their
     bids and offers. Beeks starts hitting all offers, screaming “Buy, buy, buy!” Most
     of the traders in the pit are merely sheep looking to hop on for the ride. Seeing
     Beeks bidding the market up, they believe he knows something and join in his
     buying frenzy. The rumors have started to fly: “The Duke Brothers (with Beeks
     as their agent) are looking to corner the market!”
         FCOJ prices are now on a tear, rising as high as $1.45 per pound. Until now,
     Winthorpe and Valentine have been lying in the weeds and with perfect timing
     begin to scream “Sell, sell, sell!” right at the top of the market. The true crop
     report numbers are then revealed, and the market begins to crash and, once
     again, at the optimal low point of 29¢ per pound, our boys reverse course and
     start screaming “Buy, buy, buy!” They are now covering their short sales. The
     majority of these sales were made—well above $1 per pound, so they are
     covering from 25¢ to 46¢ and netting millions in the process. The Dukes,
     having bought near the top, are left holding the bag.
         The classic 1983 comedy Trading Places is one of my all-time favorites.
     Winthorpe is beautifully portrayed by Dan Aykroyd as a rich commodity broker
     turned homeless, with Valentine played by the comic genius Eddie Murphy as a
     homeless man transformed into a rich commodity broker. Many people believe
     that the story was inspired by the silver market’s incredible rise and ultimate fall
     in 1980 when the Hunt brothers of Texas tried unsuccessfully to corner that
     market. Silver prices crashed in March of that year when the brothers were
     unable to meet their last $100 million margin call.
         The unsung star of Trading Places was the trading pit itself—the actual pit at
     the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) where real traders played themselves
     in the movie. The climactic scene (in most viewers’ minds) is the chaotic buying
     frenzy that took place in the pit (although some male viewers might argue the
     climactic scene was when Jamie Lee Curtis took her sweater off). In any case,
     the movie would not have been as visually exciting or nearly as suspenseful




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    without the trading pit. It’s hard to imagine any excitement if our heroes were
    just clicking a mouse in front of a computer screen.
         Trading Places is now more than 25 years old. The NYBOT—the exchange
    where coffee, cocoa, sugar, and, yes, FCOJ is traded—was established in 1870.
    Here comes the sad part: On December 13, 2007, the NYBOT board of
    directors voted unanimously to permanently close the trading floor, moving
    100% of the commodities trading to the computer screen. Open-outcry trading,
    the backbone of the Exchange for more than 100 years, was permanently
    silenced in February 2008. It was progress, but the pit closing put 1,000 traders
    and support staff out of work. One veteran pit trader told a New York Post
    reporter, “Most of these people really don’t know how to do anything else, and
    now we will all have to find our place in the world.” However, other than these
    folks, the closing had little to no effect on the dealings in these key global
    commodities. That’s because more than 90% of the volume had already moved
    to the computer screen by this time. In the rest of the world, electronic trading
    for commodities had been the norm for years. Although small pockets of pit
    traders remain in certain commodities, the writing’s on the wall. The computer
    will ultimately totally eliminate the pit trader. Why? Pure economics—it’s
    cheaper. No need for traders to leave their homes in the morning. No need to
    maintain a downtown facility with the associated high rents and utility costs. No
    need to hire runners, phone clerks, and trading clerks. And above all, no need
    for the pit trader. I used to pay a good pit trader an extra $2–$5 per contract
    (above normal clearing fees) to execute my trades, and I was glad to do so. If the
    guy was louder or bigger or quicker than my competitor’s floor broker, I would
    often get the better price.
         The cost savings of computerized trading is obvious, but another advantage
    emerges: a level playing field. Ernest Hemingway once said, “The best way to
    find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.” In the olden days, you really
    had to trust your pit broker. Let me share a true story with you. Years ago, I was
    using a floor broker in the New York silver pit to execute my trades there. All
    was going well until one day I placed an order to buy 50 silver contracts at a
    price that should have been easily filled. After some time had elapsed, the
    market surged higher, netting me a tidy profit—or, at least, that’s what I
    thought. I had been waiting for the pit broker’s phone clerk to call me back with
    the fill. He hadn’t called yet, so I called the floor. The broker got on the phone
    and denied I had ever placed the order. To this day, I have little doubt that he
    filled the order and pocketed my profit for himself. Because the phone call
    wasn’t recorded at that time, my only recourse was to never use this guy again,
    and subsequently I did find a pit broker I could trust. This kind of problem
    doesn’t occur with electronic trading—the computer can’t lie.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

         Other than the substantial cost savings of eliminating people, electronic
     trading offers additional benefits. You can place orders faster, as fast as a mouse
     click. During a fast-moving market in the olden days, it was entirely possible to
     miss our price by the time the runner delivered our order to the pit broker. Even
     with using a market order (required to be filled at the next available price)
     during a wild pit session, we might not have known for hours what price we
     were filled at. In erratic market conditions, a good fill was often the luck of the
     draw. Today these doubts are gone—fills return to the trader instantaneously.
     The computer can also manage multiple orders and price fills more efficiently
     than a human. Clearing firms like computerized trading as well because credit
     and risk management is automated. The computer can cut off an out-of-control
     trader before the trader’s account ever moves into an unsecured debit position.
         Reduced cost, speed, enhanced information management, the expansion of
     markets globally with 24-hour trading…isn’t technology terrific? Other than the
     loss of a few jobs and the romanticism of the bygone era of the pits, are there
     any downsides?
         The legendary trader Jesse Livermore once said something to the effect that
     technology might change, but the markets never will because markets are made
     by human beings and human nature doesn’t change. Traders today still make the
     same mistakes made by traders 50 or 100 years ago. This is true. Markets will
     continue to trend up and trend down.
         “The trend is your friend” was a basic theme of my previous books. This
     truism has not changed and will remain a primary theme for successful trading
     in this book. I can cite literally thousands of examples of markets that have
     trended long and far and, in the process, made some people rich and wiped out
     many others. You might have heard about the poor soul who lost his farm. I can
     almost guarantee that guy was bull-headed and fought the prevailing trend of
     the market until he finally ran out of money.
         In the 1920s, the New Haven railroad was the premier blue-chip stock of the
     day and sold as high as $279 per share. In those days, you could trade stocks on
     5% margin as we trade futures today. When New Haven sold 50 points off the
     top, it must have looked cheap at the time. How many would have had the guts
     to sell it short when it crossed below 179, 100 points from the top? Better yet,
     who would have had the guts, or the vision, to sell this investment-grade security
     short at 79, or 200 points from the top? It must have looked extremely cheap at
     79—remember, this was the Apple or GE of its day. Yet the trend was down,
     and after the crash of 1929, it traded as low as 12. In 2000, a friend of mine
     bought a “new technology” stock at the offering price of $66. He added to his
     position at $150 a share, again at $200, and then again at $300. I suggested he




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
1   Eliminating People                                                                      15




    use stops to lock in his profit, but he “knew” this company was only going up
    (his daughter worked there), and he told me it would ultimately trade at $1,000.
    It did keep going up beyond what I imagined it ever could, and he added to his
    position at $450 and $500. It actually traded as high as $600. Today it has
    ceased trading, going off the board at $0.
        Remember Enron? This was a “blue-chip” energy company and the largest
    contributor to the 2000 Bush presidential campaign. At that time, the stock was
    trading at $90 a share. Today it no longer exists. If you still own the stock, you
    can use your certificate as wallpaper. The trend is your friend—do not fight it.
    Electronic trading will not eliminate trends or eliminate future Enrons or silver
    crashes. The keys to successful trading are still, and always will be, successfully
    identifying the trend and practicing good money management, combined with
    the essential qualities of patience and discipline.
        I have long subscribed to Livermore’s belief that markets do not change
    because human nature does not change. In many ways, this is a truism, but not
    in one major way. Eliminating people from the middle of the equation has made
    a big difference. Electronic trading has changed the markets—hence the reason
    for this book. As a trader, I’ve had to adjust to new market realities. And if you
    trade commodities, you absolutely will need to adjust your methods as well. One
    of the objectives of this book is to help guide you through these uncharted
    waters.
        What are the consequences of eliminating people? The answer, in one word,
    is volatility. As a result, new trading skills are required for success. Speed and
    volume have combined to make the markets more volatile. Volatility can lead to
    trader anxiety; however, an anxious trader will not be a successful trader.
    Succeeding in trading today requires the ability to cope with exploding
    volatility. Think I exaggerate here? At times the markets have always been
    volatile, right?
        Are you old enough to remember the good old days when gasoline was less
    than $1 a gallon? Consider Chart 1.1.

     Chart 1.1     Crude oil 1994–1995



               This is a daily chart of the oil market for the 1994–1995 trading period.
           Each vertical line represents one full day of trading. You are looking at
           nearly one full year of oil futures trading. The chart appears to illustrate a
           volatile market with big ups and downs throughout this period. However,
           it all depends on how the chart is scaled.
               The price range during this ten-month period was an extreme high of
           $19.07 per barrel in August, with an extreme low of $17 in December. This
           is a $2.07-per-barrel range from high to low within this entire period. The
           size of one oil futures contract is 1,000 barrels; therefore, every $1-per-
           barrel move equals $1,000 profit or loss per contract traded. During this
           12-month period, we saw approximately a $2,000-per-contract range in
           price movement between the two extremes—not an atypical year for that
           period.
               Today the oil contract size is exactly the same; however, volatility has
           exploded. Consider this recent example in Chart 1.2.

    Chart 1.2     Two days of oil trading



        You’re now looking at a 30-minute chart of the oil market that covers just
    two days in August 2008. Each vertical line represents 30 minutes of trading
    (versus one day per line in the previous chart). During the first highlighted one-
    hour period (two 30-minute bars), the price ranged from $122.30 per barrel to
    $126.03 per barrel, and in just one additional 30-minute period (from 8:30 a.m.
    to 9:30 a.m. CST), oil ran up an additional $2.57. Within just this 1 1/2-hour
    period, the range was $6.30, or $6,300 per contract traded. In only 90 minutes
    this day, the price range was triple of the entire 1994–1995 trading year. The
    next day, a similar dollar move in the exact opposite direction occurred. This is
    not atypical for the current market environment.
        How about this? Chart 1.3 is a one-minute chart of the soybean market. Each
    vertical bar represents one minute of trading.

     Chart 1.3     One-minute soybean chart



         Seemingly out of nowhere in a quiet market, the beans collapsed 50¢ a
     bushel and then immediately recovered, all in less than one minute. This is
     equivalent to a $2,500 move per contract down and back up in less than a
     minute. Today, action such as this is unfortunately (or fortunately) quite
     common.
         Why this dramatic rise in volatility? Screen trading is the major culprit;
     however, reasons other than electronic trading are to blame, too. Commodity
     demand has multiplied in recent years due to the dramatic industrial revolution
     in a number of countries, notably China. This demand increase (with a dose of
     inflation) has resulted in higher prices. Higher prices lead to larger ranges for
     the same percentage moves. For $19 oil, a 10% move equals $1.90, but for $90
     oil, a 10% move equals $9. So this is part of it, but it doesn’t fully explain the
     velocity and ferocity of today’s market movements (let alone the volatility).
         Remember the old days when you heard a song on the radio and wanted to
     buy the album? The process involved physically going to the record store,
     finding what you were looking for, and returning home to play it. This process
     took time. Now you can find and download music in seconds over the Internet.

         The main reason for the increased speed of market movements is the
    Internet—a direct result of the dramatic shift during the past few years away
    from nearly 100% pit trading to nearly 100% electronic trading.
         Until recently, this is the way I would place an order in the commodity
    markets: I would pick up the phone and dial a trading floor. Hopefully, the clerk
    would pick up the phone call in a timely manner, but in a fast-moving market,
    sometimes it would ring forever, and this could be maddening. When the clerk
    did pick up the call, I would read my order, and the clerk would write it on an
    order ticket and then time-stamp the ticket. Good procedure required the clerk
    to read back my order to me for confirmation and consistency before he or she
    sent it off. The clerk would then pass my order to a runner (hopefully the runner
    was near the phone clerk and not out having a cigarette), who then physically
    walked it to my broker in the trading pit (or, at times, the broker’s clerk adjacent
    to him in the pit). The pit broker would cue the order, and when the market
    approached my price, he or she would yell out the buy or sell into the trading
    pit, looking for an offsetting trade via the open-outcry process. After it was
    filled, the process would reverse from runner to clerk, with more time stamps,
    and eventually it would be phoned back to me. This all took time. Looking back,
    it is amazing we operated this way, in most cases efficiently, for the bulk of my
    trading career.
         Now with electronic trading, orders are disseminated and received instantly
    over the Internet. Orders of all sizes from around the globe are now entered
    instantly with a mouse click, eliminating this entire human-based process.
         This volatility enables many opportunities, but it also increases the risk
    geometrically compared to the old days. So how does a trader cope with this rise
    in volatility? The answer lies in computing power. We used to keep charts by
    hand, but now the computer draws the charts for us. A computer also calculates
    those same market studies in real time that we used to do at night by hand after
    the market closed.
         As an example, in Chart 1.4, I’ve reproduced the 30-minute oil chart and
    superimposed a 60-period simple moving average. By monitoring where the
    market is in relation to this average (particularly on a close for each period), the
    computer can help a trader identify the true internal trend of a market. Today
    a trader needs to compress his time parameters and use computing power over
    shorter time spans. The computer cannot eliminate the volatility and speed of
    today’s markets—these factors are here to stay. But computing power in today’s
    market environment is a necessity to analyze the markets at a speed the human
    brain is incapable of doing.

         The bottom line of the market change is that electronics speed up the
     process, resulting in greater volatility. This means that, as traders, we also need
     to change and use technology while maintaining those time-tested methods that
     work.
         The objective of this book is to meld the necessary adjustments for the
     current market environment while maintaining those timeless methodologies
     that have worked in the past and will continue to work in the future because of
     human nature. Fear and greed ultimately move markets. And no matter what
     machines we utilize, these human traits will never go away. Speed can be our
     friend or our enemy. As the legendary trader W. D. Gann once wrote, “Most
     people are in too big a hurry to get rich and as a result they go broke.”

    Capturing a 5,000% Return



“How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values?”
—Alan Greenspan (1996)




    A variety of commodity markets have made historic price moves in recent
    years—moves that couldn’t have been imagined before the advent of electronic
    trading and the economic rise of the newly developed nations.
        This chapter explores a remarkable story of one of these virtually “impos-
    sible” market moves that theoretically returned 5,000% on margin—in just
    three months.
        Even the sleaziest of investment scam artists wouldn’t promise returns of this
    magnitude; after all, this number sounds fairly ridiculous. Yet this seemingly
    impossible move was quite real. Even more remarkable is that this phenomenal
    annualized return of 20,000% isn’t being measured from the theoretical bottom
    to the top. Before this all began, the market in question had already doubled in
    price.
        This event took place in a market not generally known for big moves at the
    low-volume, sometimes sleepy, smallest U.S futures marketplace: the
    Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE).




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross
22   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         This is the story of one of the most incredible price moves to take place in
     the history of markets. I lived through this story with two clients: one who was
     on the right side and one who wasn’t. The guy on the right side saw his account
     grow by seven figures, and the guy on the wrong side saw his account decrease
     by a similar amount. This is a story of greed, stubbornness, and vision. Looking
     back, the market telegraphed all the crystal clear signals that a trader needed to
     know (both fundamentally and technically) to be on the right side of it. In
     hindsight, it appeared easy to profit, but then again, it’s never easy, and
     hindsight is always 20/20. By reviewing what happened here, we can learn how
     to more effectively trade markets such as this in the future.
         This is the remarkable story of the Minneapolis wheat market of
     2007–2008:
         Three major varieties of wheat are traded on the U.S. exchanges. The most
     plentiful variety is hard-winter wheat traded in Kansas City. This type of wheat
     is used for bread and is grown primarily in Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. The
     Chicago variety is soft-winter wheat, used for cakes and pastries, and grown
     primarily in Missouri and Illinois. The spring variety that’s traded at the MGE
     is primarily grown in North Dakota, but also South Dakota, Montana, and
     Minnesota. Unlike the winter varieties, as its name implies, spring wheat is
     planted in the spring and harvested in late summer. It’s a premium, higher-
     protein variety used in baked goods such as bagels, French bread, and hard rolls.
     All three are the same globally traded commodity but are different varieties that
     generally move in the same direction, however, at varying speeds.
         In 2007, the world experienced widespread wheat production problems due
     to devastating heat stress in Europe, Australia, Russia, and the Black Sea region.
     The result was that all wheat prices in all three markets rose dramatically
     throughout the second half of the year.
         Anticipating the big move to come, the Minneapolis wheat futures formed a
     head and shoulders bottom formation in early June, completed when the market
     broke above $5.50 per bushel. In all my trading years, I’ve found the head and
     shoulders to be one of the two most powerful classic chart patterns. The second
     is the breakout from a consolidation; both are consolidation breakout patterns.
     (These two patterns have been around since charts were invented. Because they
     remain so reliable, I’ve devoted the next chapter to them. If you’re not familiar
     with how to identify and trade these patterns, consider reading Chapter 3, “Two
     Chart Patterns That Work,” now.)




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

       On the daily 2007 Minneapolis wheat chart (Chart 2.1), I’ve identified the
    breakout from the neckline of a clear head and shoulders consolidation pattern.
    This breakout in early June completed a major bottom formation and projected
    a minimum move to somewhere above the $6 level. In actuality, it jumpstarted
    a much bigger move than that, with a sharp rally up to the $9 per bushel level
    by late September, before the first $1 correction. This move from $5.50 to $9
    was, in itself, quite dramatic—the dollar equivalent of a $17,500 move on just
    one 5,000-bushel contract.

         High prices generally lead to increased production and lower prices.
     However, in the world’s biggest wheat exporter, the United States, the winter
     wheat crop (planted in the fall for a summer harvest) was a poor one. In
     addition, the protein content of the winter crop was low, and this is important
     to our story because it placed additional pressure on the spring wheat crop to
     replenish supplies of high-protein wheat. However, the wheat farmers in North
     Dakota and Minnesota, lured by the new biofuels promise of potentially higher
     corn and soybean prices, actually planted record acres of those crops and
     reduced their spring-wheat acres.
         After the spring planting, the summer growing weather in the Dakotas was
     less than ideal. The lower acres combined with poor yields resulted in a short
     spring-wheat crop. Add this to the tight world supplies, and these events
     combined to create the lowest level of world wheat supplies in more than 60
     years. In 2007–2008, the global supply of wheat as a percentage of usage was
     just 18%, the lowest number since World War II. This scenario created an even
     greater demand for the already short Minneapolis variety—a perfect market
     storm. Not only did smaller supplies and greater demand result in a sharp gain
     in the Minneapolis futures prices, but Minneapolis (high-protein spring) wheat
     also gained dramatically in relation to the already high prices for the Chicago
     and Kansas City varieties. Although millers can substitute different wheat
     varieties for many applications, spring wheat is required in the blending of
     higher-protein bread types, and it’s the variety most prized by the Japanese (who
     import most of their spring wheat from the United States).
         Prices continued rising into early 2008, reaching a new all-time high of $11
     per bushel in January. The high prices didn’t appear to deter most buyers;
     during February, the Japanese entered the marketplace with a standard weekly
     tender for 80,000 tons of spring wheat. Even though prices were at all-time
     highs (with every economic incentive for farmers to clean out their bins), the
     Japanese received offers for only 50,000 tons. This was a wake-up call to wheat
     traders, who started believing that the United States was totally sold out of
     spring wheat. The message was, “No spring wheat left, with six months until the
     next crop became available.” The result was a classic buying panic. Prices soared
     in a parabolic move higher, surging to the truly incredible price of $24 per
     bushel by the end of February.




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 2.2     March 2008 Minneapolis wheat


        It’s tough to put these numbers in their proper perspective, but let me try.
        Until 2007, the all-time high price for Minneapolis wheat was $7.23 per
    bushel, reached briefly in May 1996. The price then broke back to less than $4
    per bushel after the new crop became available a few months later. For the seven
    years following 1996, wheat prices didn’t go over that $4 per bushel. For the
    majority of those years, it was rare to see a $1-per-bushel move for an entire
    year. In contrast, the price of spring wheat in February 2008 moved more than
    $4 per bushel in just one week.
        In late 2007, the margin deposit to trade one contract of spring wheat on the
    MGE was $1,350, a new all-time high. As the market moved higher, the MGE
    eventually raised margins to $7,150 per contract. What do these numbers mean
    in real dollars? A futures contract for Minneapolis wheat is a standard size—
    5,000 bushels. Therefore, every penny-per-bushel movement in price is equiv-
    alent to a $50 profit or loss per contract traded. Margin in futures is similar to
    a good-faith deposit and is returned to the trader when he exits, plus any profits
    or minus any losses. Therefore, a “limit move” of 30¢ adds the equivalent of

     $1,500 per contract to the trader’s account on the right side and subtracts this
     amount from the player on the wrong side.
          At the beginning of 2008, the March contract was trading at the then all-time
     unbelievably high price of $10 per bushel. This was double, up $5 per bushel
     from early 2007. Just one contract returned the equivalent of $25,000 on this
     $5 move.
          The next move, from $10 to $24, represents an incredible and additional
     $70,000 profit (or loss) for just one contract and in only a few months. The $5
     move on February 28 alone equaled $25,000 on just a single contract. A
     $70,000 profit on a $1,350 margin deposit for one contract equals a 5,185%
     return in only three months.
          Now imagine being on the wrong side of this move, thinking prices at “you
     pick the number” were just too high. Anyone who thinks that he or she has deep
     enough pockets to ride out moves similar to this on the wrong side should heed
     the words of the great economist John Maynard Keynes: “The market can stay
     irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”
          During this drama in the futures, around the globe wheat buyers paid more
     for a premium loaf of bread or a kaiser roll (both of which use high-protein
     wheat). This brings up the question of who benefits from a price move such as
     this. In addition to the traders on the right side of the market, feel good for those
     farmers who held on to some of their production from the 2007 crop and sold
     in the upper double-digits—they were big winners. However, only a few farmers
     were in that group because, in the nature of a market such as this, the great
     majority of farmers had sold out their wheat inventories months earlier. After
     all, wouldn’t you take that $10 per bushel in January, the highest price ever seen
     in history to that date? And that’s the basic reason only a dearth of spring wheat
     existed in the first quarter of 2007.
          This price move in Minneapolis wheat was unprecedented, and although a
     big move still would have occurred, it would not have happened to this extent
     in the days of fewer people, fewer hedge funds, and pit-traded (versus
     electronic) markets. To cope with the volatility, the Minneapolis Grain
     Exchange put into place a new limit policy. Price limits for nearly 100 years
     were restricted to 20¢ per bushel per day. In 1998, the MGE raised the limits to
     30¢, and it stayed at that number for ten years until February 2008. Because of
     the mayhem, the MGE not only doubled the daily limit to 60¢, but it also insti-
     tuted an expanding-limit policy. Today, if the MGE market closes at the 60
     limit, it can increase to 90 the next day, then 135, and then 202.5, based on a
     formula contingent on how the market traded the day before. Then on a certain
     date, the MGE removes the limit on the spot month entirely. Nobody could
     even imagine doing this in the olden days.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
2   Capturing a 5,000% Return                                                              27




        At the price peak, grain merchandisers were scouring five states in search of
    spring wheat and couldn’t find any. The price for a bushel of spring wheat was
    whatever was demanded. However, at the end of this story, the day the world
    theoretically ran out of spring wheat was actually the day the highs were made.
    In 1928, the great trader W. D. Gann made the following observation: “The
    history of the world shows that there never has been a time when there was a
    great demand for anything, whether it be a product of the mine, factory, or
    farm, that sooner or later a supply in excess of that demand did not develop.
    This is but a natural law.”
        The March 2008 contract that traded as high as $24 per bushel went off the
    board at $17. The trade for actual cash spring wheat dried up the first half of
    2008, and by May, prices were back down to $11 per bushel—despite the fact
    that not one additional bushel of spring wheat had been grown since the highs
    were made. In the end, it wasn’t a question of supplies increasing; instead, we
    now know that demand had become totally satiated. Bakers switched to lower-
    protein wheat where they could, and some consumers balked at paying $1 for
    one bagel. But the real reason prices went down was that the Japanese (and
    others) paid increasingly more in a frenzy to secure supplies until their demand
    was satiated. These buyers were afraid they would run out, so they went on a
    panicked buying streak and effectively bought their entire needs for the year in
    February. This action created the parabolic-type move and the panic-induced
    high price. Millers were still working through $20 wheat in their storage facil-
    ities when wheat was trading back down at $10. Bottom line: When the panic
    buying dried up, prices plummeted.
        A trader can learn three major lessons from this example, with lesson number
    one being the most important:

    1. Never fight the trend—“the trend is your friend.” This is especially true
       during major uptrends. Who could have forecast oil at $147 per barrel
       when it was $60 the year before? I could give you a list three pages long of
       markets that moved far higher than anyone had thought possible, with
       another list of bankrupt nonbelievers filling a book. (This lesson is so
       important that Chapter 8, “The Trend Is Your Friend,” is devoted to it.)
    2. What’s important is not the news, but how the market reacts to the news.
       This is especially true when a market fails to continue with a bull move
       after the bullish news is out. Certainly, the news sets the public perception,
       but you must be alert for divergences between the news and market action.
       It’s expectation versus reality. Look for the divergence between what’s
       happening and what people think is supposed to happen. When the big




                                                                           From the Library of Kerri Ross
28   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         turn comes, the general public (and even astute insiders) will always be
         looking the wrong way.
         You can analyze reactions to news (or even a lack of news) in three ways:

         ● Moves of importance invariably tend to begin before any news justifies
            the initial price move. When the move is underway, the emerging
            fundamentals will slowly come to light.
         ● A big rally (decline) on no news is usually very bullish (bearish). The
            2007 wheat bull market was well underway before the world realized
            how critical the situation had become.
         ● It is generally not a good practice to buy after a lot of very bullish news
            or sell after an extremely bearish report, because both good and bad
            news is usually already discounted in the price.

         (Chapter 6, “The Significant News Indicator,” presents an indicator to help
         you profitably trade news.)
     3. Panic markets usually seem to top out in the same way. When close to the
        end of a major move, markets tend to become wild. Volume is huge,
        activity is feverish and erratic, and the imagination of most traders
        blossoms. If you’ve had the vision to ride the trend to this point, your
        payday has come. However, in extreme markets, people of reason lose all
        sense of proportion. They start to believe the propaganda that the world
        has literally run out of this food or that metal, but it never happens. In the
        late 1970s, the Hunts ran silver from $5 an ounce to more than $50. They
        felt it would go up forever, but they forgot that at some price, Grandma’s
        silver candlesticks come out of the cupboard and are sent to the smelter.
        The richest men in the world (at that time) lost all sense of reason and
        proportion, losing $2 billion in the process.

        Always remember what Gann told us: “The history of the world shows that
     there never has been a time when there was a great demand for anything,
     whether it be a product of the mine, factory, or farm, that sooner or later a
     supply in excess of that demand did not develop. This is but a natural law.”

     Two Chart Patterns That
     Work


“Stupidity got us into this mess, and stupidity will get us out!”
—Homer Simpson




     Shortly I introduce new trading methodologies for the new electronic age, but
     in the spirit of not throwing out the baby with the bathwater, let’s begin with
     what still works. In the previous chapter, I mentioned what I believe are the two
     most powerful classic chart patterns that continue to work.
         Many people are skeptical that a chart pattern can lead to profitability. Being
     human, people need logical explanations for why a market moves in a certain
     direction. The fundamentals of supply and demand provide that logical expla-
     nation. The problem for the trader is that the explanation is often presented in
     the past tense.
         How do you define a fundamental? In the words of George Soros, perhaps
     the world’s premier fund manager, the most important fundamental is money
     flow. How often has the oil inventory report come out bearish but the market
     closed higher? In both the short and the long run, money flow is most important
     to market direction—that is, are the buyers or the sellers more aggressive? Chart
     patterns can help answer this question.
         Global commodity consuming and producing firms possess the resources to
     gather timely and accurate fundamental data. This information is not enough by




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
30   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     itself to guarantee profitability, but this investment in market intelligence
     suggests that their information is better than what the rest of us are getting.
     Nestlé makes it the company’s business to know how the cocoa crop in the Ivory
     Coast is developing. You and I might read a brokerage house report that
     discusses the “witch’s tail disease” and how it has the potential to devastate the
     crop, but Nestlé has its people in the Ivory Coast, with others in Brazil, walking
     the fields. They have a better feel for how good or bad the crops look than we’ll
     ever have, and they have no reason or obligation to share this information with
     the rest of us. Suppose the cocoa crop is actually deteriorating. A confidential
     communiqué would be wired to Switzerland, and those in charge of cocoa
     purchasing for Nestlé would get busy. One aspect of their job is to hedge by
     buying cocoa futures. If the odds favor a drop in supply, odds favor prices rising
     after the news is known. The purpose of a hedge is to protect against future price
     risk. The Nestlé traders will attempt to hedge by accumulating cocoa futures as
     quietly as possibly before you or I know what they are up to. But there’s a catch.
     No entity is able to place a large position in a freely traded market, either on the
     long or the short side, without leaving what I call “footprints in the sand.”
     Large, significant, “informed” volume must be reported according to Exchange
     rules, and volume will inevitably move price. Technical analysis is about
     analyzing current price action and comparing it to past price action to project
     future price action.
         Does it really work? My 30 years of trading experience says it does. Solid
     technical analysis is perhaps the only tool that can give the individual trader a
     decent chance against the professionals. You might not have the research
     capabilities of the commercial firms, but you do have the luxury of moving
     faster than the big commercial operators because your trading size will not affect
     price significantly. You are not stuck trading just one market (which might not
     be moving). You can relax in the comfort of your home or office and analyze
     your charts.
         Pure technicians believe that the most important factor in predicting the
     markets is price action. They don’t look at crop size, export data, trade imbal-
     ances, or employment numbers. They don’t care if it’s raining in Brazil or if the
     head of the European Central Bank just made a speech hinting at an interest rate
     rise. Technicians primarily care about price action.
         This is not to say that technicians don’t believe fundamentals move the
     markets. They concede this fact. A technician might know that soybean prices
     are rising because drought is devastating the Brazilian crop, but he or she will
     also tell you that price will signal when the diminished supply has finally been
     rationed by diminished demand—and this could happen long before the
     drought has broken.




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
3   Two Chart Patterns That Work                                                                31




        The technician believes that all the pertinent fundamental information,
    perhaps hundreds of bits of data impossible for any mortal to assimilate, will be
    reflected in price and price action. In essence, the price action will reflect the
    consensus of the market players far better than the mainstream fundamental
    information available to the public trader. With this in mind, let’s look at two
    classic chart patterns that possess significant predictive qualities: the breakout
    and the head and shoulders (H&S).

        The Breakout from Consolidation
    Think of a market bouncing off “support” similar to a ball bouncing off the
    floor. If the floor is a deck four stories off the ground, it will bounce as long it
    remains on the deck. But if it subsequently falls off the deck, it drops lower.
    Alternatively, “resistance” is similar to a ceiling, but if a glass ceiling is smashed,
    the birds are free to fly higher.
         Support and resistance levels are very important to traders. When a market is
    in a relatively flat range (holding at support and failing at resistance), it’s called
    consolidation. Consolidation is an inability by either the bulls or the bears to win
    the battle. When the market holds at some level, rallies, and then again retreats to
    that same level, it then appears cheap. Those bulls that missed the first rally feel as
    if they have a second chance at “cheap” levels and step up to the plate. The shorts,
    especially those who are scalping and selling at higher levels, see the market start
    to bounce, and they’re induced to cover their shorts before their paper profits
    disappear. This additional buying—short covering—adds fuel to the bull move.
    The reverse occurs when the market rallies to the level of previous failure—the
    resistance point. Some of the longs who previously purchased at support might
    feel that the market is looking expensive and cash in. Bears, who missed selling the
    last rally, will consider this a “second chance” and start selling. The market starts
    its retreat, and other longs (who do not want to see their paper profits disappear)
    sell out, adding fuel to the bear fire. We know that if a market fails at a resistance
    level on numerous occasions and over a significant period of time, and then
    proceeds to trade above that level, this is a sign that the bears have lost the battle.
    The buying interest was finally strong enough to overwhelm the selling interest,
    and the defensive ceiling built by the bears has been shattered. (The opposite is
    happening if a support level is broken.) In simpler terms, a break above resistance
    or below support indicates that a major shift is probably taking place in the supply
    and demand fundamentals of the market in question. Chart 3.1 shows what a
    breakout looks like graphically.
         Take a look at the 1988 oats chart shown in Chart 3.2: the monster oats rally
    that drove prices to all-time highs that were not exceeded for the following
    20 years. Look at how long and beautiful the consolidation was that preceded
    this bull move.

        Those of you who have read my previous book Trading Commodities and
    Financial Futures know that I have a soft spot in my heart for this 1988 oats
    move. Consider the following true story:
        I had a wealthy client who was stubborn and gutsy, and who would not get
    out of his March 1988 oats contract because he felt they were too cheap. He had
    two million bushels (the limit an individual could own at that time), and I told
    him that if he didn’t get out, he would get delivery. I liked the oat market but
    suggested that he roll his March contracts into July. No, he told me he would
    take the delivery—even though when delivery takes place, a trader is required
    to put up the full value of the contract and is no longer on margin. So he took
    delivery of the two million bushels at approximately $1.60 per bushel in March.
    He wired the $3,200,000. From that day on, he told me that my job was to look
    for a good bid to sell the oats in the cash market, but neither of the big boys
    (General Mills nor Quaker Oats) seemed interested. The market traded in the
    consolidation range for a few months, and then it got hot and dry. (That’s what
    caused the breakout from the long consolidation you see in Chart 3.2.)
        The drought of 1988 is history now, but let me tell you the impact. The oat
    crop in the Dakotas was devastated. The futures traded up to approximately $4
    per bushel. On June 28, the all-time record-high day for oats, I got a call from
    one of the large processors. He asked if the delivery oats were still for sale. I told
    him yes, and he promptly offered $4 per bushel for the entire two million. I
    called my client, who told me to reject the $4 bid and offer the whole lot at
    $4.40, “take it or leave it.” When I called the processor back, he immediately
    said “Sold!” My client sold two million bushels of cash oats 40¢ per bushel
    higher than the futures price and at the all-time record price to that date. The
    client cleared a cool $5 million.
        Months later, when I asked the grain man why he was so quick to buy the
    oats at a record-high price (remember, these are oats he didn’t want at $1.60)
    of $4.40 (which was obviously too high based on the futures price), he told me
    this: “I had the choice of closing down the mill and putting 200 people out of
    work because I didn’t have any oats to make oatmeal, or paying too much and
    bumping the price of a box of cereal by 10¢. What would you have done?”
        These patterns are powerful and uncommon, and can occur in varying time
    frames. Let’s look at a few other examples. The wheat example in Chart 3.3
    illustrates a potentially false breakout (which later proved true) and the fact that
    breakouts from consolidations can occur during a trend move, not just at the
    beginning. I have found that a potentially “false” breakout, which later proves
    true via a successful second attempt, usually turns out to be an excellent signal.
    Certainly, these patterns can signify breakouts to the bear as well as the bull side,
    as the cattle example in Chart 3.4 illustrates.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross

       The previous charts are all daily charts (one bar equals one day’s trading). In
    today’s new electronic age, breakouts can occur in any time period, and traders
    need to be ready. Take a look at this breakout on the five-minute chart shown
    in Chart 3.5. (One bar on this chart equals five minutes of trading.)

    Chart 3.5     Copper (five-minute chart)




        On a sleepy Cinco de Mayo, with London closed due to a holiday, the New
    York copper market was in a tight consolidation between $3.83 and $3.86. The
    breakout above consolidation occurred at 7:10 AM above the $3.86 level.
    Within 20 minutes (four 5-minute bars on the chart), the market traded as high
    as $4.27, representing a move of 41¢, or $10,250 per contract. The margin for
    one contract at the time was $7,763, so this was more than a 100% return in
    less than a half-hour. Don’t even try to calculate what the annualized return
    would look like—a ridiculous number. Ten minutes later, the market was back
    below $4. The news? There was none. Stops were hit all the way up, and the

36   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     market eventually ended back where it started within a day. A move of this
     magnitude would not have occurred in this short of a time period during the pit
     days because professional pit traders would have stepped in to blunt the rally at
     an earlier stage. Still, the time-honored breakout from consolidation signaled
     the way to go on this one.


     False Breakouts
     Although this stuff is good, and I believe it usually works, you didn’t think this
     would be all that easy, now, did you?
         When I first discovered technical analysis, I studied the profitable examples
     in the books and thought this trading gig would be a piece of cake. Unfortu-
     nately, as with all of life, it doesn’t work all the time. I must tell you that false
     breakouts from consolidation have occurred and will continue to occur. Many
     traders are well aware of how powerful a tool these patterns can be. As a result,
     they look for these breakouts. Many technicians will place stops just under
     support to limit losses or establish new short positions. Professional traders
     know intuitively where these stops will be. It’s not sinister; they can make an
     educated guess on where the stops are by looking at a price chart, and they look
     at the same charts as everyone else. For example, if a market has held numerous
     times at 95 and it approaches that level again, what’s to stop a professional
     trader from offering the market down to 94.90? The objective is to uncover the
     sell stops, and he can do this on the screen as well as he could have from the pit.
     A sell stop is a resting order to sell at some predetermined level. If the stops are
     actually “resting” at 94.90 (numerous brokers representing hundreds of traders
     from various unrelated firms could hold them), the selling commences.
         Sometimes this action can feed on itself. The sell stops in place at 94.90
     immediately begin to work. The resting orders to buy at 94.90 are filled, so the
     market is offered lower (94.80, 94.70, 94.60), but everyone seems to be selling,
     and its all on stops. The scalpers love this, especially in a quiet or thin market.
     They will come back in and bid at 94.50 and 94.40, for example, and cover their
     shorts at a quick and tidy profit. Because no fundamental substance caused this
     price action, the market quickly bounces back above 95 as the shorts are covered
     and commercial traders and bargain hunters step in. As a speculator, getting
     caught in a false breakout is frustrating. Seeing your stop hit and knock you out
     of a good position, only to watch the market quickly reverse in the direction you
     thought it was going in the first place, will steam you. If you trade long enough,
     this will happen to you, so keep your cool. Place your stops carefully, where you
     don’t think everyone else’s stops are.

3   Two Chart Patterns That Work                                                           37




    Six Rules for Trading Breakouts from Consolidation
    Breakouts from consolidation are such powerful indicators of potential trend
    changes that you should never become complacent when they occur just because
    false breakouts sometimes exist. My six rules for trading breakouts from consol-
    idation should help.

    1. The longer it takes to form a consolidation, the more significant the
       breakout and the bigger the expected move to follow. A breakout on a
       daily chart is more powerful than a 30-minute chart, and a breakout on a
       weekly chart is even more powerful. A breakout from consolidation on a
       yearly chart is the most powerful, signifying a major fundamental change in
       the supply-and-demand balance of that market.
    2. After the breakout occurs, the market can retrace back to the breakout
       level, but it probably shouldn’t trade back into the consolidation zone. If is
       does, the odds of a false breakout increase.
    3. The breakout should remain above the breakout level for a significant
       amount of time. After it moves above the resistance or below the support,
       you shouldn’t be in much trouble if you went with the breakout. If profits
       are not forthcoming in a reasonable amount of time, be wary. A quick
       failure is a symptom of a false breakout.
    4. Watch the volume on the breakout day because a true breakout is generally
       associated with a sharp rise in the daily volume. Sometimes this high-
       volume level might precede the breakout by a day or two; however, false
       breakouts are usually associated with modest volume.
    5. When trading a breakout using stops, never place your stops just below
       support or just above resistance. All the amateurs do this, and they become
       bait for running the stops. It’s generally better to take a bit more risk and
       place your stop at a slightly greater distance.
    6. A basic rule of thumb, which truly does work (if you use some judgment),
       is that when a market breaks out from consolidation, it will move roughly
       the distance up or down equal to the horizontal distance of the
       consolidation phase. I term this phenomenon “the count” (see Chart 3.6):
       The longer the consolidation, the bigger the count. To determine the count,
       measure the horizontal distance of the consolidation; then measure upward
       from the resistance breakout or downward from the support breakout, to
       give you an indication of the price objective for the coming move.

     Chart 3.6     The count



        The Head and Shoulders (H&S)
     This chart pattern isn’t new, but it’s still really good. Robert D. Edwards and
     John Magee made the head and shoulders (H&S) pattern famous in their book
     Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, published in 1948. This book is often
     referred to as the “Bible of Technical Analysis.” The basic premise was that
     prices of stocks and commodities move in repeating and identifiable patterns—
     the result of the ebb and flow of supply and demand. Although some of the
     concepts presented in the book were new at that time, many had been around
     since the turn of the century. The head and shoulders is one of those timeless
     patterns. Although markets have changed dramatically since the 1940s, human
     nature has not, so this pattern remains a valid indicator today.
         The H&S is a reversal pattern, signaling a change in the prevailing major
     trend. I will spend time reviewing this concept because, in my experience, it
     remains one of the most reliable. I also add my own twist to identifying and
     analyzing this pattern. This pattern is also more common than the breakout
     from consolidation chart pattern discussed earlier.




                                                                          From the Library of Kerri Ross

        When you see an H&S pattern, it’s time to get out and take your profits, cut
    your losses, or establish a new position in the new direction. An interesting
    characteristic of the H&S is that it not only tells you a market is making a top
    or bottom, but it also tells you how far the ensuing move will travel. The H&S
    does not actually pick the top, or the bottom, but it gives you the sign after the
    top or bottom is in place.
        Because a picture is worth a thousand words, let’s start with a few charts that
    illustrate the H&S pattern. First consider Charts 3.7 and 3.8.

     Chart 3.8     Gold H&S top




         The head (H) is a price peak; another peak lower than the head to the left
     is the left shoulder (LS), and another peak lower than the head to the right is
     the right shoulder (RS). The line connecting the lows of the declines from the
     shoulders and the head is called the neckline (NL). In a classic H&S,
     the neckline is often horizontal (similar to a support line). However, it can also
     be upward-sloping (as in Charts 3.7 and 3.8), similar to an uptrend line, or
     downward-sloping, similar to a downtrend line. This is where your analytical
     skills come into play. Many of the best H&S patterns are mutants, which
     resemble the original but in a skewed way.
         You can spot an H&S developing when the left shoulder and the head are in
     place and the market starts to rally from the “neckline.” If it fails at a lower high
     than the major high, the right shoulder is in formation. A classic H&S often has
     a right shoulder of the approximate same size and duration as the left. However,
     it can be lower or higher, longer or shorter, but its peak will ultimately end up
     lower than the head. The pattern is not complete until the right shoulder is
     completed and the decline from the right shoulder’s peak breaks under the
     neckline. When that happens, a top is presumed. It is time to exit longs and go
     short. After the initial breakout below the neckline, the market often rallies back




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
3   Two Chart Patterns That Work                                                                41




    up to approximately the neckline, giving the trader an excellent low-risk
    shorting opportunity. H&S patterns can also sometimes provide false signals.
    Suspect a false signal if the market is able to rally back above the peak of RS.
    (This is the place to initially set your risk point.) This will not occur with the best
    H&S signals—most will not rally beyond the NL. If the market trades above the
    peak of the right shoulder, you can safely assume that all bets are off and this
    one isn’t “right.”
       There’s a bonus that comes with the H&S: It also provides a target that is
    generally reliable and more precise than most technical techniques. If you
    measure from the top of the head to the neckline and bring this measurement
    down from the neckline, you have a target for a minimum objective where prices
    will subsequently end up. The market can certainly move farther than this count
    for the objective, but it gives you a minimum objective that could prevent you
    from exiting prematurely.
       H&S patterns occur in all time frames, and you can often find them in the
    short-term S&P chart. With a smaller pattern, you usually need to shoot for a
    smaller objective. Chart 3.9 illustrates a short-term complex H&S pattern on a
    45-minute chart (each bar represents 45 minutes of market activity) that I traded
    successfully from the short side while I wrote this book.

         Watch volume to confirm the pattern. Volume often will tend to spike at the
     head and usually is higher than average at the break of the NL.
         An H&S occurs at major bottoms as well and looks like the mirror image of
     one that forms at the top. Some traders call these inverted head and shoulders,
     or reverse head and shoulders. In this variety, the head is at the lowest point, with
     two higher shoulders at either side. Other than the fact that these are the mirror
     image of the tops, you trade them the same way. The gold H&S bottom (Chart
     3.10) is of the simple, classic variety; the soybean illustration (Chart 3.11) is
     more complex. Note how the extended and complex bottoming pattern
     signaled the start of a major move that greatly exceeded the minimum objective
     (see rule 2).

    Ten Rules for Successfully Trading the Head and Shoulders
    1. Never anticipate. When I first discovered H&S patterns, I had an excellent
       trade and then it seemed I started finding them everywhere. I would start
       to sell after a right shoulder and a head developed, only to lose money. I
       would see complete H&S patterns develop and take action before
       penetration of the neckline, only to have my head handed to me. As Yogi
       Berra said, “It ain’t over till it’s over.” Wait until the pattern is completed
       before you trade it.
    2. The bigger the H&S pattern and the longer it takes to develop, the bigger
       the subsequent resulting move.
    3. The count is a minimum measurement. Odds actually favor the move
       carrying much further. However, a warning here: As with all chart
       patterns, we are not dealing with a certainty here. If your count says the
       market will fall 400 points, and it falls 380 and starts to reverse, it would
       be a shame to let all your profits evaporate over a lousy 20 points.




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross
44   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     4. After the market breaks the neckline, watch for the return move back to
        the neckline. This occurs in at least half of all valid cases and offers a place
        to enter with a close stop.
     5. Watch the slope of the neckline. Downward-sloping necklines for H&S
        tops increase the odds for a more powerful bear move to follow. Upward-
        sloping necklines for inverted H&S bottoms increase the odds for a more
        powerful bull move to follow.
     6. Be volume cognizant. The most reliable neckline breakouts are
        accompanied with higher-than-average volumes. In retrospect, I have
        sometimes seen the highest daily volume days of the year associated with
        H&S patterns.
     7. Watch for the head to also form an “island.” This combines two very
        powerful patterns and geometrically increases the validity of the signal (see
        Chart 3.12).

3    Two Chart Patterns That Work                                                           45




     8. When the pattern is completed, it should act correctly. These patterns are
        fairly reliable and do not often deviate from their true purpose, unless, of
        course, they are false. How can you tell if a pattern is false? One good
        indication is that your margin account will start to show a loss. Don’t
        freeze when it’s not acting properly—when in doubt, get out. Be suspicious
        if the pattern occurs on low volume. Remember, the market can retrace to
        the neckline—this is normal and a good place to position—but if the
        pattern is good, the retracement really shouldn’t go much further.
     9. If it’s a false signal, look to reverse your course. I’ve found that a classic
        H&S failure often offers an excellent opportunity to get back in sync with
        the major trend. If the market again trades above the right shoulder’s top
        (or below the right shoulder’s bottom for a reverse H&S), odds favor, at
        the minimum, one last thrust to a new high or new low. I would buy the
        market at this point, with the objective of a new high, risking to under the
        neckline. For an inverted H&S failure, sell the market under the low of the
        right shoulder, with a minimum objective of a new low, risking to above
        the neckline.
    10. After a false signal is confirmed, watch the market action closely as soon as
        a new high or low is registered. I’ve noticed that an H&S failure, not the
        final high or low, ultimately leads to a new contract high or low in short
        order. The H&S was telling us we were close to the major top or bottom,
        but the bulls or bears were able to mount one last hurrah. If the market is
        unable to show much follow-through after this climatic top or bottom
        (following an H&S that didn’t work), be ready to take action because a
        major top or bottom is now in place.

    The Voice from the Tomb
    (Super Seasonal #1)


“I’m not afraid of dying; I just don’t want to be there when it happens.”
—Woody Allen




     When you have traded as long as I have, you acquire a lot of knowledge. Unfor-
     tunately, not all of it is useful; however, I believe this might help you. I have
     discovered two seasonal tendencies that could help you capture profits: one in
     the soybean market (which I describe in the next chapter) and the other in the
     wheat market.
         Between 1983 and 1995, my trading business was located on the floor of the
     Grain Exchange where I met a very successful old-time trader. Other traders
     would ask this man’s opinion, which was highly regarded because he was known
     as a successful trader. His response often was, “Listen to the ‘Voice from the
     Tomb.’” Over the years, I befriended him and finally got up the nerve to ask him
     what he meant by this statement. He told me that the “Voice from the Tomb”
     (VFTT) was one of the secrets of his success, and the legend goes something like
     this:
         Years ago, a millionaire grain trader lost his wife and dedicated his life to his
     three children. But as in many second generations of self-made people, the
     children were lazy and thought they would inherit all his money. As he aged, he
     began to look at his children as wasteful, and he believed they took him for
     granted. When he died, he left nothing to the children and instead gave all the




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
48   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     money to charity. All he left them in his will were dates of when to buy and sell.
     The will stated that if they strictly followed his advice, they would have the
     fortune they had always expected to inherit.
        Then my friend shared the VFTT dates for the wheat market:

        ●        Sell March wheat on January 10
        ●        Buy May wheat on February 22
        ●        Sell July wheat on May 10
        ●        Buy December wheat on July 1
        ●        Sell December wheat on September 10
        ●        Buy March wheat on November 28

         He told me these dates worked for him 80% of the time (a remarkable
     percentage for a trading program), but he never shared exactly how he used
     them in his own trading. So I went back and studied the wheat charts.
         I researched 35 years and found that the VFTT was historically profitable
     approximately 75% of the trades, based on the criteria I developed. The criteria
     was simple: I would buy or sell at the close of each date and risk 15¢ per bushel,
     or $750 per contract, to make 15¢, or $750 per contract. If a date fell on a
     Saturday, I would take the trade on the Friday close; if the date fell on a Sunday,
     I would use the Monday close. I started trading it with real money in 1999, and
     it worked nicely for eight years up until 2007. The actual results were as follows:

        ●        1999—Profitable five out of six trades
        ●        2000—Four of six
        ●        2001—Six of six (Chart 4.1)
        ●        2002—Four of six
        ●        2003—Four of six
        ●        2004—Three of six
        ●        2005—Five of six (Chart 4.2)
        ●        2006—Four of six

       So during this eight-year period, I experienced 35 profits and only 13 losses.
     And in 2001, it was perfect—six trades and six profits (see Chart 4.1).
     The overall result was more than 70% profitable—a nice little program.
       In 2005, it resulted in five profits and only one loss (see Chart 4.2).

         Since I began trading with real money, it had one break-even year, seven
     profitable years, and no losing years until 2007. In 2007, it self-destructed: The
     results were only two for six. What made that year worse was the first trade was
     a short sale that came out the day before a major crop report. The crop report
     was bullish, resulting in a sharp gap higher at the market open the day of the
     report and creating a 27¢ loss on our 15¢ stop. Now I needed two wins just to
     make up for that one loss, but, unfortunately, the next two trades were losers as
     well. This was also the first and only time since I had been trading the VFTT that
     it had three losing trades in a row. I told my clients that something had changed,
     something was not right. After eight years of a winning program, I retreated to
     the sidelines. As it turned out, two of the three remaining trades that year
     worked, but overall, this was the year the VFTT didn’t work.
         Then in the summer 2008, a client of mine who had been on the program
     for years and was still monitoring it asked if I had been watching the VFTT. He
     said that after we quit, it was working nicely again. During the last three trades
     of 2007 and the first four trades of 2008, it was five for seven—in other words,
     right back on track. So I took another look at the program that had been so good
     for so long, and this is what I discovered.
         Remember the bad trade in January that took place right before a major crop
     report? If the signal had taken place one day later, at the close the day of the
     crop report, it would have worked. The May signal didn’t work, and I gave up
     before the July signal, but that one worked like a champ. The September signal
     would not have worked, but if it had taken place one day later, it would have
     worked. And the November signal worked just fine. This told me that the basic
     seasonal tendencies still seemed to work, but something was off a day or two for
     certain signals. That something was the major crop report in both January and
     September, which skewed the program. And guess what? For decades, the crop
     report had come out on the 10th of the month. But due to date changes, the
     January report had come out a day later than the usual 10th date, as had the
     September report. I believe the VFTT works because it’s based on normal
     seasonal tendencies for the wheat market. For example, the July buy signal takes
     place about the time the winter wheat harvest is approximately half over.
     Because many farmers sell their wheat crop right out of the fields at harvest
     time, the tendency is for prices to fall into the harvest period due to greater-
     than-normal supplies available to the marketplace at that time of year. The
     futures market anticipates the end of harvest and generally bottoms, and then
     starts to climb as the harvest period turns the corner and unwinds.
         When a crop report comes out, traders react to it. A bullish report might be
     released during a normally weak seasonal period and might spike the market




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    higher. However, in a normal year, the market tends to move along the normal
    seasonal path of least resistance after the news is out. Based on its stellar past, I
    believe it’s time to revisit the VFTT program, but with one major modification.
    We need to look at the trading calendar to determine when the monthly crop
    report will be released. If a signal is due to take place the day before the report,
    wait a day and buy or sell at the close the day of the report. My theory is this:
    If the seasonal is bearish and the report is bullish, we will short the artificial
    spike and then let the bearish seasonal take over. If the report is bearish and we
    end up selling lower, the normal seasonal trend will bail us out anyway. This
    improvement would have turned a 2-and-4 year into a 4-and-2 year in 2007 and
    maintained the winning streak. As we go to press in 2008, the VFTT is solidly
    back on track; see Chart 4.3.

        One last observation: Think of my 15¢ rule as an optimization rule. The
    trend often moves much farther, and you can make considerably more than the
    15¢. Sometimes you need to take the 15¢ to 20¢, and other times you can make
    a lot more. Note the February 22 signal on the 2008 chart. The buy came at $10,
    and with zero risk on that signal, the market rallied above $12, or 200¢
    ($10,000 per contract traded), in just three trading sessions before the first
    significant correction occurred. So you might want to wait and watch a bit when

     the profit target is met, and use a trailing stop. One method is to raise your stop
     to ensure a modest profit when the 15¢ number is reached, and try to maximize
     the trade.
         Bottom line: I believe the VFTT will put the odds in your favor—just watch
     out for those crop reports.
         Some traders believe that seasonals exist in many markets, but in my
     experience, I’ve observed them successfully only in the grain markets. “Voice”
     dates occur for corn as well. But my experience is that they’re not as accurate as
     those for wheat, which is why I didn’t include them here. However, I have
     discovered my own extremely reliable seasonal for the soybean market, which I
     present in the next chapter.

    The Soy Secret
    (Super Seasonal #2)

“Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.”
—Benjamin Franklin

“The man who has no secrets from his wife either has no secrets or no wife.”
—Gilbert Wells
     In this chapter, I plan to share with you our second super seasonal called the soy
     secret.
         The soy secret is simply this: Soybeans exhibit a very strong tendency to form
     a seasonal price bottom during the month of October. The large number of farmers
     who tend to sell their crop right out of the fields at harvest time to generate cash
     causes selling pressure and creates this bottoming tendency. Sometimes, particu-
     larly in high-priced years, this market behavior is more pronounced than others.
     After the harvest selling pressure subsides, the soybean market tends to exhibit a
     post-harvest rally, offering a profitable trading opportunity.
         When I quantified the probabilities for a soybean price rise post-harvest, I
     discovered something quite exciting.
         My database covers 40 years, from 1968 through 2008. In Table 5.1, I sorted
     this data not by year, but by the percentage gain the July (of the following year)
     soybean futures contract made from the October low price to the high for each
     year’s July contract. (This is the last column.) The “Risk” column refers to the
     maximum price break (measured in cents per bushel) for that crop year under
     the October low price (post-October), and the “Gain” column measures (in
     cents per bushel) the highest price achieved after the October low was registered
     for the contract.

        For example, the July 2008 soybeans neatly followed the pattern (Chart 5.1).
     The contract low was made on October 7th at $9.67 per bushel. A dramatic
     uptrend ensued, with an interim high (that went off this chart) in March at just
     below $16 per bushel. The actual contract high was reached during the delivery
     period in July at $16.60 per bushel. It would have been hard not to make some
     money this year using the soy secret.

     Chart 5.1     July 2008 soybeans (daily chart)

        Let’s analyze the data in Table 5.1 to develop a trading plan.
        Looking at the last column first, we see only two years with zero gain—
     which means there were only two years when the month of October was the
     high-priced period for the July contract. For 38 of the 40 years, at least some
     price gain occurred above the October lows. However, trading is never as easy
     as buying in October and selling at a profit sometime later—we need to be
     realistic based on some risk-to-reward criteria. In the real trading world, I
     identified seven years (1974–75, 1981–82, 1983–84, 1990–91, 2004–05,
     2005–06, and 2006–07) where I make the assumption that a trader who knew




                                                                           From the Library of Kerri Ross
5   The Soy Secret (Super Seasonal #2)                                                     57




    about this “October market secret” might not have profited because a
    measurable price drop from the October lows occurred before any big gains. For
    example, in 2006–07, even though the market eventually gained 11% from the
    October 2006 lows, I placed this year in the losing category because the market
    made a lower low in November. This November low was only 20¢ per bushel
    less than the October low and was followed by a big rally post-November, so it
    is certainly possible that a trader actually would have profited this year on the
    soy secret. However, to be conservative, I placed years such as this one in the
    losing category. Even if we include years such as this one in the red category
    (shown in bold in the table), we see an excellent chance to make a nice profit
    with minimal risk by buying in October for 33 of the 40 years (more than 80%
    of the time).
        Remember that every year is different, and you have no guarantees or sure
    paths to profit. You might want to study the fundamentals of a particular year
    (acreage planted, carryover supplies, and projected demand) or look for a chart
    signal to confirm that the tendency is working this year. However, knowledge
    is power and understanding historical odds can only improve your odds for
    future success. And one last thought: How about we keep our “market secret”
    just between us?

    The Significant News
    Indicator


“First the doctor told me the good news: I was going to have a disease named after me.”
—Steve Martin



     As long as markets have existed, savvy traders have paid attention to the
     market’s reaction to significant (potentially market-moving) news. This was true
     in the days of the ticker tape and is still true in today’s electronic age.
         Significant news should, by definition, result in a significant market reaction.
     But it doesn’t always happen, and many times the reaction is opposite of what’s
     commonly expected. In this chapter, I present my “significant news indicator”
     (SNI). The SNI will help you trade the market’s reaction to news. It’s as much a
     trading philosophy as an indicator, but because we’re able to apply specific rules
     to news reactions, the SNI can be as useful as any mathematical indicator.
         To introduce the concept, consider this statement: What matters is not the
     news, but how the market reacts to the news. Certainly, the news sets the public
     perception, but you must be alert for divergences between the news and market
     action. It’s expectation versus reality. Look for the divergence between what’s
     happening and what people think is supposed to happen. When the big turn
     comes, the general public will always be looking the wrong way.
         Remember that losing January Voice from the Tomb (VFTT) short sale,
     when the market gapped higher after a bullish crop report? The news was
     bullish, and although the market reacted to it initially, the underlying funda-
     mentals were bearish, and the market ultimately could not hold on to the gains




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

     the news created. When the wheat market couldn’t hold the initial gains, the
     market was telling a trader to listen to it and not to the news; it was saying that
     the seasonal tendency of the VFTT was ultimately correct, particularly when
     wheat futures fell below the price posted before the release of the “bullish”
     news.


     Six News Rules
     1. If bad news is announced and the market starts to sell off in large volume,
        it’s a good bet that the market’s going lower.
     2. If the market fails to react to good news, it probably already has been
        discounted in the price.
     3. Moves of importance invariably tend to begin before any news justifies
        the initial price move. When the move is underway, the emerging funda-
        mentals will slowly come to light. A big rally (decline) on no news is usually
        very bullish (bearish).
     4. It is generally not a good practice to buy after very bullish news or sell after
        an extremely bearish report, because both good and bad news can already
        be discounted in the price.
     5. Always consider whether the trend is down or up when the news is made
        known because a well-established trend will generally continue regardless
        of the news. I remember getting caught in the emotion of a very bullish
        corn report in January 1994. Looking back, this news was the very top. An
        opposite (very bearish) report the following year turned out to be the
        springboard for one of the biggest corn bull markets in history and led me
        to develop the SNI.
     6. When unexpected news occurs (news that the market has not had time to
        prepare for) and the market opens in a wide range or “gaps” lower or
        higher, sell out your longs or cover your shorts and wait. Watch the market
        for 30 minutes to an hour. If the market opened sharply lower with heavy
        selling and was not able to trade much lower than that, it’s into support,
        and you can buy it with a tight risk point. Watch the market closely at this
        point and note the tone of the rally. If it’s small and the market is able to
        again fall under the levels made when the bad news came out (or rise above
        the levels made when the good news came out), it’s safe to assume the
        market is going lower (higher).




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

        I remember the big bull coffee move of 1994. One day the market was
    trading in the mid-80¢ level. I was long. Unexpected news hit the wires about
    the surprise government release of massive Brazilian stockpiles of coffee. These
    stocks were supposed to be held in reserve and off the market, but Brazil needed
    foreign exchange at the time and changed its policy. The market gapped lower
    at the open and proceeded to trade down 400 points, stopping me out in the
    process. It remained weak for a day or so, but as soon as the market was able to
    cross above the mid-80¢ level again (the price registered before the unexpected
    bad news hit), it basically went straight up. This was the time to reenter. It was
    up to about $1.40 before the first freeze hit. The full move wasn’t over until
    coffee prices hit close to $2.75, and the monster bull run began when the
    market, on no news, crossed the level made before the release of the bad news.
        In summer 1999, the British Central Bank announced it was going to auction
    off half of its gold reserves, calling gold a “barbaric relic.” The price was about
    $250 per ounce, and although this news was bearish (flooding an already weak
    market with massive additional supply), this was the absolute bottom.
        The bearish crop report of 1995 led to me to develop the SNI (although I did
    not formally put a name to it until this book). We were moving from Minnesota
    to Lake Tahoe and driving along Interstate 80 on the day of the report—August
    11, 1995. I had a large long position in the December corn for clients and
    myself. At that time, the crop was looking good and nobody knew the weather
    would turn unfavorable late that summer, creating a short crop. I must have had
    my reasons for being long, but my hopes were dashed when the crop report was
    released before the market open that day. I remember calling my assistant from
    the road when he told me “limit down.” The crop report was so bearish in
    reporting an increased size of the upcoming crop that the early calls were for the
    market to open down the (then) 10¢–per-bushel limit. And not only limit down,
    but the early banter was that the market would open limit down and “lock,”
    meaning I could get stuck in my position with only offers to sell limit down and
    no bids at that price. It made me uncomfortable as I sweated out the hour and a
    half before the market’s open, trying to decide how I’d work out of this mess
    from the road. I asked my assistant to call me right before the market opened
    and give me a blow by blow.
        The market did open sharply lower—7¢ lower, to be exact—but not limit
    down, to our surprise. The market gave me, and anyone else who was long, a
    chance to get out and save our skins before a limit-down move. But instead of
    trading lower from the 7¢-lower open, my assistant told me corn was beginning
    to trade up from the 7¢-lower open. It felt as if a cloud were lifted, and my
    nervousness disappeared. I told him to place a stop on our entire position just
    below the opening price of 270 (see Chart 6.1).

        I continually checked in that day, but the stop was never hit. When the
     market was trading higher for the day, I instinctively knew I was safe. That 270
     low registered because of the bearish news was a major low that was never
     challenged again the rest of that year. It actually turned out to be a significant
     low that held up for years, and it was the springboard for one of the biggest bull
     moves in history. By the next year, due to crop problems in the United States
     and globally (China turned from the largest corn exporter in Asia into an
     importer), corn prices had doubled.
        The SNI is a fairly simple, but powerful, concept: The SNI is the price at
     which a market is trading just before the release of a significant market news
     event. The news is generally a preplanned event; however, it can also be
     unexpected.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    SNI Rules
    Here’s how to successfully use the SNI in your trading:

    1. If the news is considered bullish, the SNI is your major support number
       and, if acting properly, the market should remain above it. If the market is
       acting properly after a bullish event, you can enter a long position with a
       stop just below the SNI.
    2. After a bullish news event, a move below the SNI generates an automatic
       sell signal, and you can immediately enter a short sale with a tight stop just
       above the SNI.
    3. If the news is considered bearish, the SNI is your major resistance number
       and the market should remain below it if acting properly. If the market is
       acting properly after a bearish event, you can enter a short position with a
       stop just above the SNI.
    4. After a bearish news event, a move above the SNI generates an automatic
       buy signal, and you can immediately enter a long position with a tight stop
       just below the SNI.

       When the SNI is crossed, it tells a trader when to enter and where to place a
    protective stop. However, it doesn’t tell a trader when to exit a profitable
    position. (Other technical indicators or a trailing stop should be used for that.)
       It’s important to know what the market is expecting before the release of the
    news event so that you can accurately judge whether the market is acting
    properly. For example, if a crop report is to be released and the market is
    expecting an increase in soybean acreage of 2 million acres, an increase of
    1 million is bullish news. You would need to know the average “guesstimate” or
    expectation before the release to accurately evaluate the report and the market’s
    reaction to it.
       I’ve instinctively used the SNI after every crop report for many years. I
    simply evaluate the market’s reaction versus expectation.
       For example, the October 2006 crop report was considered bullish for corn.
    The market was anticipating a record-large (bearish) corn crop estimate of more
    than 11 billion bushels on the USDA report; however, the crop size was reduced
    by 2% and was well under this figure. The market closed the day before the
    report at 284 (this was the SNI) and opened limit up at 304 the day the report
    was released (see Chart 6.2).




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

     Chart 6.2     December 2006 corn


         The market was not able to remain limit up that day and gave ample oppor-
     tunity to enter a new long position, based on our first rule. The sell stop should
     have been placed at just under 284, the closing price before the report’s release.
     For the remainder of that year, countless opportunities arose for traders to take
     a decent profit entering after the bullish news was well known to the market-
     place.
         In contrast, that same report was considered very bearish for soybeans. The
     market was looking for an unchanged soybean crop estimate; however, the
     USDA report indicated the crop size was more than 3 billion bushels for the first
     time ever. This was up 3% from the September report and was record large.
         The January 2007 soybean futures closed the day before the report’s release
     at 577; however, the market opened higher at 588 after the “bearish” number.
     The SNI was therefore 577, and a higher open was an immediate and automatic
     buy signal according to our fourth rule, with an initial sell stop just below 577
     (see Chart 6.3). The market continued to climb until the end of November. Even
     though the number was considered “bearish,” the Chinese turned out to be
     major buyers of soybeans for the remainder of the year, pushing prices much




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    higher (although a trader could not have known that at the time of the report).
    However, the market certainly knew this, leaving countless footprints in the
    sand. Take another look at Chart 6.3. On the day of the “bearish” report, you’ll
    also see a beautiful breakout from a consolidation. The news didn’t matter as
    much as how the market reacted to this news.

       The SNI works not only with crop reports, but also with financial reports
    and other news events, both expected and surprise.
       Every Wednesday, the oil inventory report is released at 10:30 AM EST. This
    number typically moves the oil market, sometimes sharply. This is an example
    of a typical reaction to a bullish supply number: On this report day the first
    week in June, just before the release of the number, the nearby oil futures were
    trading at 12230. The market was looking for a slight drawdown in weekly oil
    stocks, but the actual number was a 5 million barrel drawdown—bullish. The
    market immediately traded higher and, within a minute, was trading above
    12300 (see Chart 6.4). The market exhibited a bullish reaction to the news and
    was acting properly.




                                                                          From the Library of Kerri Ross

     Chart 6.4     June 5, 2008, bullish inventory report

         After the market moved higher fast, many traders would have shied away,
     believing the news was already out and discounted. However, this was an
     opportunity based on our first rule. The chart looked good, the market was
     acting correctly, and you could enter a long position with a stop just below the
     12230 SNI, the price just before the release of the news. The reason? If the
     market is any good, it shouldn’t be able to trade below the point just before the
     release of the bullish news. Subsequently, the market ran above 12400,
     corrected, made a higher low at approximately 12300 (at which time the stop
     could be raised to just below this higher low), and a trailing stop could have be
     used. During the following 48 hours, this particular move ran up to 13900—
     more than $13 or $13,000 per contract—before the first significant correction
     took place.
         Two weeks later, another “bullish” inventory report was released with a
     higher-than-anticipated drawdown. Just before the release, the market was
     trading at 13700. This number should have been noted as the SNI. The market
     immediately traded higher (acted properly), up to 13836. However, within an
     hour after the number was released, the market reversed and quickly moved
     below the 13700 SNI (see Chart 6.5). Unlike two weeks earlier, it was able to
     trade below the point before the release of the bullish news. This is bearish
     action according to our second rule. A trader could have gone short on a stop
     just below this 13700 number and, if filled, place a buy stop just above.




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 6.5     June 18, 2008, bullish inventory report

        Within the following 24 hours, the opportunity arose to make up to $5,000-
    per-contract profit on the short side with effectively zero risk after entry. Note
    that the SNI doesn’t tell you when to exit a profitable position. It signals an
    entry point. You can make the stop close to your entry point, but an alternative
    method is required to signal your exit. You can judiciously utilize a trailing stop.
    In this example, we saw a reversal bar at the lows with a mini H&S bottoming
    pattern that signaled the bottom.
        The following week, the number was bearish, with a larger-than-expected
    stock build. Just before the release of the number, the oil market was trading at
    13570 (see Chart 6.6).




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

     Chart 6.6     June 25, 2008, bearish inventory report

         After the release of the numbers, the market was initially acting properly—
     bearishly—and a nimble trader could have gone short by utilizing a trailing stop.
     The market subsequently bottomed below 13200. But the following day, it was
     able to trade above the “bearish” number, and this was a bullish sign. Hopefully,
     if short, a profit was “locked in” via the use of a trailing stop. However, if still
     short, the minute the market crossed above the 13570 level, all shorts should be
     immediately covered and new longs could be entered with a tight stop. The
     market is now trading above the level of the bearish news, and this is a bullish
     development according to our fourth rule. Even though this occurred a day
     later, it was still within a fairly short time period. This is why it’s important to
     note the price level just before the release of significant news—the SNI. SNIs are
     important numbers and often will act as major support or resistance for days—
     even weeks—into the future.
         This works equally well for financial news events. For example, in July 2008,
     it was anticipated that the European Central Bank would raise rates by a
     quarter-point, but it actually raised rates by a half-point. Just before the
     announcement, the euro was trading at 15815. Just after the announcement, it
     acted properly by trading higher, reaching 15853 within an hour. However, that
     same day, the market crossed below the 15815 level, the price just before the
     announcement. A sell stop could have been used at just below this number (for

    example 15810), based on our second rule. In what turned out to be a zero-risk
    trade, the market collapsed 200 points, or $2,500 per contract, and traded in
    short order (see Chart 6.7).

        I could fill a book with examples similar to these; they occur almost every
    day. When you know an important report (a crop report, an unemployment
    report, a Fed interest rate announcement, an inventory report, or a stock
    earnings report) will be released, note where the market is trading just before
    the release. This level will be your SNI, and you can use it to successfully trade
    against—usually setting up trading opportunities with high potential reward in
    relation to the risk. It’s all based on the simple premise that is key to successful
    trading: What matters is not the news, but how the market reacts to the news.

    Breaking Par



“Perfect numbers, like perfect men, are very rare.”
—Rene Descartes



     In golf, “par” denotes an ideal score for the best golfers, but the generally
     accepted definition of par is merely “average or ordinary.” Therefore, “above
     par” has come to mean an above-average or extraordinary event.
         In the financial markets, trading “above par”—above the psychologically
     significant number of 100—is considered an important market milestone. If the
     price of a bond is trading above 100 (for example, at 106), it’s trading “above par”
     and at a “premium.” This is a sign of strength. If the same bond falls and subse-
     quently trades down to 94, it would be trading at a “discount” or “under par.”
         Although the number 100 should have no greater significance than any other
     integer, in the real world, I’ve discovered that crossing above 100—the breaking
     of par—is quite significant from a trading standpoint. For example, it was a
     global news event when our dodo pit trader overpaid for his $100 oil contract.
         You can apply this same rule to any big round number, such as 500 or 900;
     however, those beginning with a 1 and ending in two or more zeros (100, 1,000,
     and 10,000) are considered the patriarchs.
         The loudest cheers ever to ring out from the floor of the New York Stock
     Exchange resounded on November 14, 1972, when the Dow Jones Industrial
     Average crossed the 1,000 mark for the first time. This was the most important
     psychological barrier for the Dow ever. For the previous six years, it had tried




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
72   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     and failed to break above “Dow 1,000.” A few years after 1972, the Dow broke
     back below 1,000 and just kept dropping. During the brutal bear market of
     1974, it traded as low as 577. It took eight years for the Dow to cross above
     1,000 again, but once it was again able to (in 1982), it has remained above ever
     since.
         When a market breaks above a psychologically significant number, it creates
     a trading opportunity. I haven’t statistically quantified this, but after making
     thousands of trades over a wide variety of markets, my experience has been that
     the market will continue to move higher by another 15% minimum—in most
     cases, up to 30% and, in many cases, by much more. So if a market crosses above
     100, odds favor a move to at least 115, and likely 130, before falling back. And
     if the price of a stock or commodity crosses above 300, anticipate a move to at
     least 345 and likely 390.
         On April 1, 2004, the price of one share of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
     (CME) first crossed 100, closing that session at $100.50 per share (Chart 7.1).
     If at that time you believed this all-time high price was “too high” and you
     waited for a return to double digits to be a buyer, you’d still be waiting. After
     the first cross of 100, CME quickly ran to 130 and then 148 before the first
     meaningful correction. It subsequently has traded as high as 700, and back down
     to 400, but it has never again traded below par.

       This magical rule of breaking par and continuing upward is one that I’ve long
    observed and traded successfully for many years, but it’s not my discovery. I first
    paid attention to this concept after reading Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,
    the semi-autographical account of Jesse Livermore written nearly 100 years ago.
    Livermore writes: “It has been my experience that whenever a stock crosses 100
    or 200 or 300 for the first time, it nearly always keeps going up for 30 to 50
    points, and after 300 faster than after 100 or 200. It is an old trading principle.”
       At one point in the book (my absolute top must-read for every trader),
    Livermore discussed how he waited six weeks without trading for that perfect
    opportunity to rebuild a trading stake:
           I really began to waver and sweat blood when the stock got up to 90.
           When it got to 98 I said to myself, “Bethlehem is going through 100,
           and when it does the roof is going to blow clean off!” I tell you, I saw
           100 on the tape when the ticker was only printing 98. So I said to
           myself, “I can’t wait until it gets through 100. I have to get it now. It is
           as good as gone through par.” …I put in an order to buy 500 shares of
           Bethlehem Steel. The market was then 98. I got 500 shares at 98 to 99.
           After that she shot right up and closed that night at 115. I bought 500
           shares more. The next day Bethlehem Steel was at 145 and I had my
           stake. But I earned it. Those six weeks of waiting for the right moment
           were the most strenuous and wearing six weeks I ever put in.
        This rule holds equally true for commodities.
        When sugar first crossed above 100 on the monthly chart (10¢ per pound
    equals 1000 on the tape) in August 2005, it didn’t stop there. It quickly ran
    above 1100, then above 1200, and then above every XX00 until the move was
    finally over with the February 2006 peak at a price of 1973 (Chart 7.2).

        A “Par” Case Study
     In late 2007, the soybean market was in a bull trend. The carryover supplies for
     2008 were projected to be very tight, and I was watching the July–November
     2008 soybean spread for a possible cross above 100.
         July soybeans represent the current crop (the crop that was harvested the
     previous autumn), and November soybeans represent the “new” crop (the crop
     that will be harvested the following year). Soybeans are planted in the spring and
     harvested in the fall. When trading futures, we are certainly dealing with the
     unknown—too an extent—and we knew very little in late 2007 about the
     November 2008 beans because this contract represented a crop that was not
     planted yet. Preliminary estimates were available on the acreage farmers would
     plant in the spring, but these planting intentions would certainly change based
     on the price of soybeans versus competing crops. We knew nothing about
     weather, potential yields, demand, and so on. Anyone buying or shorting
     November beans was certainly betting on the unknown. We knew more about
     the “old” July crop because this crop was already harvested. The old crop price
     had been fluctuating, and would continue to fluctuate, based on demand (for
     exports, biofuels, livestock feed, and the hundreds of other soy uses) plus
     differing opinions and future changes in the official supply numbers. July comes




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
7   Breaking Par                                                                            75




    near the end of the crop year, and the ultimate price of July soybeans in July is
    dependent on ending-crop-year supplies being tight or plentiful at this time
    before the new crop becoming available. This spread historically is volatile
    because we are dealing with two completely different crop years. Although the
    overall soybean market might be bullish or bearish, and all the months might
    move higher or lower together, the different crop years almost always move at
    different speeds and sometimes in opposite directions.
        This was a bullish soybean market, and the July crop had been gaining on the
    November crop throughout 2007. At one point during the summer, the spread
    was at “even money” (with the July price equal to the November price), and by
    Thanksgiving, it was approaching par, or 100. At that time, the July soybeans
    were trading nearly $1 (100¢) above the November contract. From experience,
    I believed, as Livermore had taught us, that a break above par would open up a
    new and potentially profitable trading opportunity. The question was, how to
    play it? As you read this case study, remember that it is pertinent to all markets,
    not just the July–November soybean spread. I want to give you a feel for how I
    approach a potential trade, and this is designed to provide you with a template
    for analyzing and hopefully successfully trading any market that crosses par.
        The first step was background analysis, to find and then analyze what I call
    analog years of this spread. Analog years always have one characteristic in
    common. For example, we can analyze all drought years for the soybean
    market—in this case, a spread break above 100—but remember that no two
    markets act identically.
        I knew that this spread had been above par in the past, but not very often. It
    is a highly unusual event for the July contract to be trading $1 per bushel above
    the November contract. The “normal” spread is the cost of carry—what it costs
    to hold soybeans for about five months (mostly the cost of money and
    storage)—and this number (depending on the prevailing interest rate and the
    raw bean price) has historically been about 5¢–10¢ per bushel per month. For
    the spread to be trading at a $1 difference or higher means something quite
    unusual is taking place beyond the normal supply-and-demand balance between
    two consecutive crop years.
        Using CQG historical data, I could find only six previous years when the July
    contract traded at or above 100 more than the following November contract:
    1973, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1997, and 2004.
        I then examined these analog years to see how the spread acted on a break
    of 100. For example, look at Chart 7.3 of the July–November 2004 spread.




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

     Chart 7.3     July–November 2004 soybean spread

         After the spread crossed 100 in this year, it never looked back. If you entered
     the spread on the first cross of 100 (or even on the first close above 100) and
     risked to a close below, you would never have been in trouble. The minimum
     profit objective of a 15%–30% move (or 115 to 130), as outlined in the “profit
     objective zone” on Chart 7.4, was easily attained. In fact, the spread traded
     above 200 this year.
         Now that we were armed with this historical knowledge, we were ready to
     trade the 2007 spread because we knew what to look for when it was trading
     properly. This year, the spread first broke and closed above 100 on November
     29, with the close at a 103 premium for the July contract—a buy signal (see
     Chart 7.4). However, the next day, it broke and closed under par at 96,
     indicating that this was a false signal. The proper action at this time was to take
     the loss of approximately 4¢–7¢, depending on our entry point.

    Chart 7.4      July–November 2008 soybean spread

        The spread remained below par until December 10, when it once again
    crossed and closed above—a new buy signal. The correct play was to reenter,
    and this time the profit objective zone was quickly and easily reached and,
    ultimately, exceeded. However, note that the profit should have been locked in
    at the first sign of a trend reversal. (Tip: You can also use a moving average line
    to help identify trend reversals on spreads.) If it weren’t turned into real cash,
    the profit eventually evaporated because the spread collapsed after it crossed
    back under 100 in January. Actually, this theory works both ways. You can play
    a cross under 100 just as effectively as a cross above. Just reverse the rules and
    always pay attention to your money management.
        Livermore’s timeless observation that breaking par often results in a quick
    and significant follow-through is a powerful concept. Don’t forget it, and plan
    to revisit it.

    The Trend Is Your Friend



“When in doubt, predict that the present trend will continue.”
—Anonymous

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.”
—Mark Twain

     The title of this chapter might rhyme and sound clever, but don’t underestimate
     it. When talking about successful trading, these words are some of the most
     profound around.
         A successful trader once told me, “If you can correctly determine the trend
     of a market, you will make money.” Although this might sound like a simple
     concept, it’s not easy to accomplish in the real world.
         The reason you’ll make money when you correctly identify the trend is that
     the odds favor your position, showing a profit in short order. Even if your
     timing is initially off, if you have correctly identified the major trend, many
     times the trend will bail you out. On the other hand, when you attempt to pick
     tops or bottoms, you must be extremely nimble in booking any available profits
     because they’ll be fleeting—when the trend reasserts itself, those contra-trend
     profits will quickly evaporate.
         Just as it’s much easier to swim with the current than against it, and easier to
     walk with the wind than against it, it’s generally much easier to trade with the
     trend than against it. The trick is how to determine the prevailing trend—and
     determine it early enough to reap the benefit.




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
80   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         It’s a paradox that the trend is always pointing up at the very top and down
     at the very bottom, and people who are somehow able to pick tops and bottoms
     certainly make the most money. I profess that I’m unable to do this (I personally
     know no one who can do it consistently), but the good news is that we don’t need
     to capture a full move to make money—a portion of the move will do just fine.
         My approach to analyzing the markets is predominantly technical. In the
     long run, fundamentals will determine price. However, as Lord Keynes said, “In
     the long run, we’re all dead.” My primary goal in trading is to determine the
     true trends of the markets we trade. My premise is that if you are able to
     accurately determine the trend, you will (over time) make money.
         In the previous chapter, we touched on one method of trading with the trend.
     To “break par,” the trend must already be established and working; we’re just
     hopping on a train for the ride. In this chapter, we delve into a simple method of
     market trend determination and touch on how to potentially stay out of trouble.
     I use the “Keep It Simple, Stupid” (KISS) method here because simple is often
     better (at least, for my simple mind). The concepts presented here will be familiar
     to many of you, but bear with me because this dovetails into Chapter 9, “The
     Natural Number Method,” where I introduce a new, simple, yet powerful,
     commodity-trading system that forms the heart of this book.
         On the soybean chart shown in Chart 8.1, the trend is up. You can’t dispute
     this fact because the soybeans registered a new contract high price on the last
     date. There’s a statistical means of saying what we know to be true here.
     Statistics are most useful when we are unsure of the trend, and the statistic we
     use here is the 50-day weighted moving average (WMA). (If you are unfamiliar
     with how moving averages work or with the differences between the moving
     averages types, skip to the moving averages primer in the Appendix, “A Moving
     Average Primer, an Open Interest Primer, and the Advanced Open Interest
     Course.”)
         I’ve drawn the 50-period (50-day, in this case, because it’s a daily chart)
     weighted moving average on Chart 8.1. In KISS terms, the beans are in an
     uptrend because the market is trading above its 50-day WMA.
         What if we’re not long the beans from an earlier (lower) price and we’d like
     to be—should we buy them here? You can eyeball it and see that the market is
     trading well above its 50-day WMA (11.5% is significantly above). Therefore, if
     we risk to a move below the 50-day WMA (risking to a downtrend), we’re
     assuming a significant dollar risk. Certainly, I wouldn’t want to go short in this
     market, either—that would be top picking. Top picking would have been
     unprofitable at any prior period on this chart—extremely unprofitable if
     attempted weeks earlier. How would we have known that any one of the
     previous days (let alone the most recent day) was the top? The trend is up and




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
8   The Trend Is Your Friend                                                              81




    soybeans could certainly move higher; however, buying late in the trend makes
    a purchase riskier from a risk-to-reward standpoint. Therefore, there are better
    trades out there, at least until a correction when the risk would be more
    reasonable (assuming our risk is below the 50-day WMA).

    Chart 8.1     November soybeans (December–February)

        What if you had bought the beans when they had last crossed above the
    50-day WMA? The last break above the line actually occurred months before
    this chart began—the previous October, at 914—and the market had not been
    able to close under the 50-dayWMA since that date. A trader would be up more
    than $5 per bushel at the end of this chart (late February). That’s more than
    $25,000 per contract, and the risk at the first cross was minimal. If you had
    bought beans on that first cross above during the previous October, and you had
    the discipline and patience to still be holding in February, your dilemma now
    would be when to take your massive profit—the best kind of dilemma to have.
        Now let’s turn our attention to this natural gas chart (see Chart 8.2), a
    market in a confirmed downtrend. We know this natural gas is in a downtrend
    because it is close to new lows and trading below the 50-day line. This chart is
    a mirror image of the soybean chart.




                                                                          From the Library of Kerri Ross

     Chart 8.2     December natural gas

         If we are bearish and not yet short, should we consider shorting natural gas
     here? It’s “cheap,” just slightly (about 3%) below its 50-day WMA, so the risk
     in shorting is reasonable (assuming we plan to risk just above the moving
     average line). What if we had sold on the first break of the 50-day WMA on
     August 30, just below 1025? If a trader had shorted just one contract on that
     close, he or she would be up $25,000 per contract by the end of the chart (a
     period of less than two months) and again with minimal risk. Actually, the
     50-day WMA helped me here because I was bullish at the end of August, and the
     close under the 50-day WMA was one of the indicators that kept me out of big
     trouble. By selling out on the first break under, I took a small loss on that
     trade—but, more important, this prevented a large loss. Should I have gone
     short on the cross day? Sure, in the ideal world, I would have had a position up
     nearly $25,000 per contract. In the real world, it’s hard to go against your
     fundamental bias. Once again, the 50-day WMA was much smarter than I was—
     “the market is always right.” I cannot emphasize this enough: The trend is your
     friend, and don’t fight the trend.
         Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying this is foolproof, and false signals will
     certainly happen. For example, take a look at the sugar chart in Chart 8.3. It’s
     a well-defined downtrend, but you can see the glaringly false buy signal on that
     two-day temporary spike above the average in early March.




                                                                           From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 8.3     July sugar

        I’m saying that this simple indicator—the moving average—many times will
    keep you out of trouble and improve your odds of positioning on the right side
    of the trend.
        One of the keys to success is to look for markets that are close to their
    moving average. This alerts us to potential changes in trend (when the line is
    crossed) or a confirmation that the trend is still intact (if it’s not crossed or
    bounces off the line). For example, the advantage of taking a trade just as the
    50-day WMA is crossed is that you can reduce the risk on the trade. If you risk
    to a close on the other side of the line, your risk per trade is comparatively much
    lower than taking a trade well above or below the line. And you certainly will
    experience times when your risk will be very low, with a huge potential reward.
        Another key to success in markets (and life in general) is to just go with the
    flow—don’t fight the trend. Keep this concept in the forefront of your mind as
    we now plow ahead to a simple yet powerful commodity-trading system.

    The Natural Number Method:
    A Breakthrough Strategy for
    Capturing Market Profits

“It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”
—Yogi Berra



     Jesse Livermore’s theory on breaking par works—I’ve seen it in action many
     times. But if we waited for that 100 number to place a trade, we wouldn’t make
     that many trades. That 100 number is rare, and plenty of markets have exceeded
     it without ever dropping back under it again. It’s highly doubtful that gasoline
     will ever again sell for $1 per gallon or gold for $100 an ounce. Still,
     Livermore’s theorem got me thinking. Is breaking through round numbers
     significant, and if 100 represents a significant barrier, then how about 200 or
     300?
         Markets tend to behave differently at the significant break points—numbers
     that end in zero. I call these natural numbers, and numbers that end in two or
     more zeros I call master natural numbers. Livermore’s theorem got me thinking
     about using natural numbers in conjunction with trend identifiers to design a
     methodology to profit in today’s electronic marketplace. More about this
     shortly, but first, let’s again discuss identifying trends.
         A basic tenet of this book is that, with computers and the Internet, markets
     move faster than ever before. For example, the corn market has been one of the
     tamer commodities for decades, moving an average of 20¢–30¢ per bushel in a
     month’s time—the equivalent of $1,000–$1,500 per contract traded. However,




                                                                           From the Library of Kerri Ross
86   The New Commodity Trading Guide




     in recent years, corn has consistently moved that much in just a day or two. Take
     a look at the daily chart for December 2008 corn from mid-February to mid-
     March (see Chart 9.1). This is a fairly typical chart for today’s market
     environment. Hindsight is always 20/20, and you can look back and easily see
     that this two-month period represented a classic uptrend in the corn market
     (evidenced by the fact that the chart begins in the lower-left corner at approxi-
     mately $5.30 per bushel and ends in the upper-right corner at approximately
     $6.30 per bushel). This was a full move of $1 per bushel, the equivalent of
     $5,000 profit per contract traded if long (or loss if short) during this two-month
     time frame. However, it wasn’t a neat move. This was not an easy market to just
     buy, go home, and forget about. What if you bought December corn on March
     13 at 590, or even on March 18 at 560? Sure, if you held it for a month, you
     would have been fine; however, you needed nerves of steel, deep pockets, and
     a well-capitalized account because the market plummeted as low as 513 on
     March 24. If you took a vacation, the margin clerk would have probably sold
     you out during that sharp break sometime between March 13 and March 24
     when the market collapsed from 590 all the way down to the lows seven trading
     days later.

        If you were a bull and a bottom picker, and were fortunate enough to have
    bought the exact bottom at 513 on March 24, you were never in trouble. The
    truth is, catching the exact bottom is just about impossible. And as the old
    trading adage goes, “Bottom pickers will get their hands slapped.” If you are
    able to pick bottoms or tops with a fair degree of accuracy, I’d certainly like to
    hear about it. You’ll be the one to make the most money and you don’t need to
    read any further. In all my years of trading, however, I have not been able to do
    this—and I don’t know anyone who can. In my experience, usually the best we
    can do is to successfully determine the trend and hop on for part of the ride. So
    how do you do this without betting the farm?
        Let’s go back to the time period from the corn chart in Chart 9.1, but this
    time focus on the six trading days of March 18–25. This was a move from 564,
    down to 513, and right back up to 564. This time, let’s utilize a faster time
    period to provide more detail than the daily chart can provide. Chart 9.2 shows
    the 30-minute chart for that six-day period. (Each vertical bar now represents
    30 minutes of trading versus one full day per bar in the daily chart.) Later I will
    explain why we picked the 30-minute chart over a faster or slower interval, but
    for now, just take this in.

         The 30-minute chart provides us with a more detailed perspective, and it’s
     easier to view the classic downtrend during the March 18—24 period, followed
     by the classic uptrend. However, we’re viewing this chart in hindsight, and it’s
     always easy to spot the major trends looking back. In the thick of the battle, it’s
     virtually impossible to identify bottoms and tops, so how could we know for
     sure what the trend was and when it had exhausted itself?
         Let me ask you this: If this 30-minute chart were your only view of the corn
     market, or if today were March 25 (at the extreme right of the chart), could you
     tell me what follows to the right? Did it continue moving higher (off the chart,
     so to speak), or did the market run into resistance and head back down? Can
     you tell the future? As it turned out (take a look at the daily chart), the market
     continued higher to 630 by mid-April. But on March 25, we had no way of
     knowing that.
         So we’ve come full circle back to the $64 question: What’s the most
     important information we need to know to profit in a particular market
     scenario? I believe that it’s the trend of the market. Livermore once said
     something to this effect: “When trading, if you can correctly determine the
     trend of a market, you will make money.” This makes sense because if you’re
     correct on the trend, you can successfully position yourself on the right side of
     the market. Even if your timing is initially off but you have identified the major
     trend correctly, the trend will often bail you out. But how can we determine
     what the market trend is at any point in time and when the trend has changed?
     By eyeballing the previous chart, you could easily determine that the trend was
     down March 18–24 and then sharply up into the 25th (and we also know this
     from viewing the daily chart into mid-April). Hindsight is always 20/20, but in
     the thick of the battle, it’s not easy to determine the major underlying trend.
     This period no doubt would have wrecked havoc with a fundamental trader
     because these moves didn’t appear to coincide with the “news.” However, one
     of the tenets of technical analysis suggests that if the markets appear irrational,
     you are missing something important, and the more irrational the trend appears,
     the more likely it’s real. The primary question remains, at any single point in
     time: How would you really have known what the trend is or when it had
     exhausted itself?
         When using a moving average to analyze a market’s trend, I recommend
     basing the calculations on the closes and using either exponential or weighted
     averages. In my experience, although the simple moving average will generate
     similar signals, I’ve found either the weighted moving average (WMA) or the
     smoothed exponential moving average (EMA) to be slightly better. The real
     conundrum is which length to use. Shorter-term averages are more sensitive.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                   89




    With a more sensitive average, the good news is that your average loss will be
    smaller, but the bad news is that the “whipsaw factor” increases geometrically.
    A long string of small losses is no better than a small string of large losses, and
    the latter problem can surface when using too long an average. Losses will be
    larger with a longer-term average, and so will the unrealized profits left on the
    table. However, the really big money is made with the big moves, and a longer-
    term average will keep you with the big trades during the big swings and with a
    lower tendency to whipsaw. So what’s the “right” answer?
        I’ve found in this new faster electronic age that the answer is to use a longer-
    term average in conjunction with a shorter-term time frame.
        Let’s stick with the 30-minute corn chart for now. On Chart 9.3, I have
    superimposed a 180-period weighted moving average line.

    Chart 9.3 March 18–25 corn (30-minute with 180 period WMA)

       By using a longer-term moving average (in this case, a 180-period average)
    superimposed on a shorter-term chart (in this case, a 30-minute chart), we
    increase our odds of being on the right side of the prevailing trend. However, if
    we bought every time a market traded above a moving average and sold every
    time it traded back below, we would be in and out of the market too often
    during choppy periods, leading to whipsaw activity.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross

         The classic definition of a whipsaw is a saw with a handle at both ends that
     was used in the old days by two loggers to cut down trees. Now the best place
     to see a whipsaw is in the antiques shop, but you can picture two guys on either
     side of a log sawing back and forth. A whipsaw, moving back and forth in alter-
     nating motions, will help cut a log, but it consumes capital relentlessly when
     trading. So I started to think, could natural numbers take some of the
     randomness out of the process? Natural numbers are round numbers. When you
     round a number, you “bump it up” or “bump it down” to a nearby cleaner
     number.
         Our definition of a master natural number is a number that ends in two or
     more zeros. The classic master natural number is par or 100, followed by the
     other master natural numbers, 200, 300, and so forth. However, any number
     that ends in one or more zeros, meaning a multiple of 10, 100, 1000, and so on,
     is a natural number. Therefore, 300 is a master natural number, 320 is a natural
     number, and 322 or 323 are common numbers.
         Humans generally view natural numbers as significant. If your car odometer
     is rolling over to 10,000 or 100,000, don’t you want to see this? If you have
     people in the car and the odometer hits 49,999, you will probably make an
     announcement to your passengers so that everyone can see the rollover to
     50,000, right? Businesses and individuals go to extra effort to get a phone
     number such as 456-7000 or a post office box number such as 3400 because
     round numbers are easier to remember. Recall how people around the globe
     celebrated the new millennium at the beginning of the year 2000? Even though
     the event wouldn’t really occur until the end of that year (the beginning of
     2001), 2000 was a really big deal—and I don’t remember New Year’s 2001 as
     having the same pizazz.
         In the universe of numbers, natural numbers are rarer than their common
     brothers and sisters and, therefore, hold a special significance to people. People
     make markets, and any student of the markets has probably observed that
     volumes generally increase at the natural numbers. I wondered if natural
     numbers would also act as significant support or resistance points.
         Livermore first pointed me in this direction. After extensive testing, I deter-
     mined that natural numbers possessed statistically greater odds of being
     important support and resistance levels than random numbers. I then used this
     information to develop the trading methodology that I will share with you
     shortly, but consider this simple explanation of what lies ahead. Suppose gold
     broke above a significant moving average at the price of $897. Should we be a
     buyer at the market or would it be prudent to wait for the market to move to
     the next natural number (in this case, the master natural number $900) to be a




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                   91




    buyer? In an uptrend, the downside of waiting would be to forfeit $3 of
    potential profit. The upside of waiting could be fewer whipsaws. What if the
    market broke under a significant moving average at $897? The closest lower
    natural number is $890, so waiting to go short at that number would forfeit $7
    of potential profit. The question is, over a large number of trades, will waiting
    to enter at the closest natural number enhance our bottom-line profitability?
        The failing of many traditional moving-average systems is those whipsaws
    that can string a series of small losses to create a large equity drawdown that
    only the deepest of pockets can withstand. Bottom line: After extensive testing
    in a variety of markets and conditions, I conclusively determined that waiting to
    take signals at the closest natural number averts a significant percentage of
    whipsaws, leading to a smoother profit curve.
        It’s a difficult undertaking to identify attractive opportunities. And after you
    identify them, it’s even more difficult to turn them into realized profits.
    Successful trading is more than identifying opportunities; it requires knowledge,
    discipline, and patience. Keep all this in mind as we move on to this new break-
    through strategy for capturing market profits.
        In the following pages, I introduce you to a trading method that I designed
    and use myself that has never been in print previously. It’s a dynamic trading
    strategy that you can apply across a wide variety of markets. It’s designed to
    capture profits in the electronic commodity markets and is based on the
    philosophy that natural numbers represent significant price points.
        Although I’ve personally found this trading methodology useful, please do
    not blindly follow it as outlined. Before trading real money, familiarize yourself
    with the concepts presented here and then paper-test them on any market of
    your choosing. Only when you’ve convinced yourself that what’s presented here
    is useful and you’re risking money that you can afford to lose should you
    consider applying it. And one more thing: Whether you use my program, you
    should be trading real money only if the following true disclaimer doesn’t scare
    you away.

      Risk Disclosures

     Commodity futures trading is speculative and involves substantial risks; you should
     invest only risk capital.
         You can lose a substantial amount—or all—of your investment. Therefore, you
     should carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your
     financial condition.
         The high degree of leverage that is obtainable in commodity trading can work
     against you as well as for you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as
     large gains.
         If the market moves against your position, to maintain your position, your broker
     might call on you, on short notice, to deposit additional margin money. If funds are
     requested and you do not provide them within the prescribed time, your position may
     be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.
     Under certain market conditions, you might find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a
     position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a “limit move.” Placing
     contingent orders, such as a “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” order, will not necessarily limit
     your losses to the intended amount.
         There is no guarantee that the concepts presented in this book will generate profits
     or avoid losses.
         Past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.



         Phew, now that we got that out of the way, let’s get to it. But first a few
     words about what this is not: This is not an “investment” strategy. It is not for
     “buy and holders.” It is designed for commodity-futures traders who understand
     the risks and rewards associated with a leveraged vehicle. It is designed for
     above-average returns but has the associated above-average risks. You can
     universally apply specific rules for the system over many markets; however,
     specific markets possess variables based on the prevailing market tone. I am not
     teaching you how to trade. Learning to trade successfully requires more than
     one book. Instead, I provide you with a method that should help you. I give you
     a step-by-step outline for how to use and apply it. I give you no guarantees here.
     Regardless of how or what you trade, always remember that we are dealing with
     the unknown, and nothing is foolproof. With that said, I believe what is
     presented here can be a valuable technical tool that will help you to determine
     and successfully ride the prevailing trend. And as Livermore told us, “When
     trading, if you can correctly determine the trend of a market, you will make
     money.”

        The Natural Number Method (N#M)
    The Natural Number Method (N#M) is fairly simple—you don’t need to be a
    math genius, and trade signals are very specific. Properly applying N#M
    requires access to real-time quotes and charting. We begin with…


    How to Generate a Trade Signal

    The Buy Signal
    First, calculate the 180-period weighted moving average and draw it on a short-
    term chart. Why the 180 period? I’ve found through actual trading experience
    that this is a dynamic number—the natural number method using the 180-
    period WMA is useful over a diversified portfolio of uncorrelated markets.
    N#M involves using a longer-term average over a shorter-term time frame to
    determine the trend. Other similar periods work just as well, but for this
    methodology I’ve found that less than 100 is too sensitive and more than 200
    lags too much. The 180-period WMA is the constant; the variable is the optimal
    time period to use for a particular market and for varying market conditions.
       Next, use the 180-period WMA to determine the major trend.

    N#M Rules: Buy Signal
    Entering a new trade from the long side requires three steps:

    1. The setup
    2. The confirmation
    3. The buy signal

    The Setup On the short-term chart, a bar (for example, the 15-minute chart
    generates one bar every 15 minutes) must close above the average. This forms
    the setup bar and creates the setup. (Note that merely trading above the 180-
    period WMA does not qualify as a setup because the market could subse-
    quently trade back under the 180-period WMA line before the bar’s close. A
    true setup is created only on a close above the line.)
    The Confirmation After the setup is created, the market must subsequently
    exceed the high price of the setup bar. The confirmation occurs immediately if
    the market trades above the high price of the setup bar.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
94   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         When both steps 1 and 2 are met, the trend is determined to be up. These
     actions set up N#M for a new potential buy signal.
     The Buy Signal The next step is to determine the closest natural number. This
     number is the entry point for the buy signal.
         For example, the 180-period WMA for oil (a moving target) is currently at
     12755. We are using a 15-minute chart in this example, and a bar closes at the
     price of 12765 (above the moving average). Therefore it’s a true setup. The high
     of this bar is 12775. When the market trades above 12775, the oil market now
     confirmed that the trend is up and is set up for a new buy signal at the next natural
     number (in this case, 12800). (Because of the volatility in the oil market, we
     actually use master natural numbers for a new signal.) Therefore we would at this
     time place a buy stop to enter a new long position at 12800. If the market should
     close under the moving average before the 12800 buy stop is hit, the setup for this
     buy signal is canceled, and the process begins again. In this case, we wait for a new
     setup, confirmation, and buy (or sell) signal, with trade entry at the closest natural
     number. However, in this example, we will automatically be stopped in a new
     long position if the market trades up to 12800. After being stopped in a new buy,
     the sell stop on this new long position will initially be placed at the closest lower
     natural number (in the case of oil, the next lower master natural number of
     12700). After a new trade is executed, the stop will be trailed—for a buy, raised
     one natural number every time a new higher natural number is exceeded until the
     trend turns and the market takes us out. When we’re out, we wait for the next set
     up, confirmation, and signal. You might be totally confused at this point; however,
     this will all become clearer as we move forward.
         Although I’m sure most of you know how to read a simple bar chart, look at
     the example in Chart 9.4 that uses a 15-minute bar chart for crude oil. First note
     the “no setup” bar on the left. This bar traded above the moving average line but
     closed below it (the horizontal “flag” to the right of each bar is the bar close),
     so it was not a setup. The setup occurred on the first close above the 180-period
     WMA at 12685. The high of this setup bar was 12697, and this number was
     exceeded on the subsequent bar in the move above 12697 (the confirmation).
     The next-closest natural number was 12700. After the setup bar closed and
     confirmed, a trader could immediately place a buy stop at the 12700 master
     natural number because he or she could observe the confirmation, and the buy
     signal would likely occur in short order. After the buy signal was entered (a new
     long at 12700), the trader would place a sell stop at the next master natural
     number lower (in this case, 12600). The risk on this trade was predetermined at
     100 points, or $1,000 per contract (plus any slippage and fees). The upside is an
     unknown at this time. When the market traded up to the next master natural




                                                                                From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                   95




    number of 12800, the trader could raise the sell stop to the next-lower natural
    number (12700, in this case). At this point, the risk on the trade was minimized
    to a small number, an approximate break-even, with the upside still open. When
    the market traded up to 12900, the sell stop was raised to 12800 (ensuring a
    worst-case profit on this particular trade). The 12800 sell stop was eventually
    hit for a 100-point profit on the trade during the same trading session. At this
    point, the trader was out of the market waiting for the next signal.

    Chart 9.4     Buy signal example



    The Sell Signal
    The sell signal is the mirror image of the buy signal. First, the 180-period WMA
    line is calculated and drawn on a short-term chart.
        Our program rules remain the same for a sell signal (mirror image):

    N#M Rules: Sell Signal
    Entering a new short requires three steps:

    1. The setup
    2. The confirmation
    3. The sell signal




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
96   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         On the short-term chart, a bar (for example, the 15-minute chart generates one
     bar every 15 minutes) must first close below the average. This forms the setup bar
     and creates the setup. To clarify, just trading below the 180-period WMA does not
     qualify for a setup because the market could subsequently trade back above the
     180-period WMA line. A true setup is created on a close only below the line.
         After the setup, the market must subsequently trade under the low price of
     the setup bar. This is the confirmation. When both steps are met, the trend is
     determined to be down, and this action sets up a new potential sell signal.
         The next step is to determine the closest natural number, which will be our
     entry point for a new sell signal.
         As an example, the moving average for oil (a moving target) is currently
     trading at 12755. The 15-minute chart has a bar close at 12745 (below the
     moving average) and is, therefore, a true setup. The low of the bar is 12725.
         When the market trades below 12725 in this case, the oil market has now
     confirmed that the trend is down and is set up for a new sell signal at the next
     master natural number (in this case, 12700). Therefore, we would now place a
     sell stop to enter a new short position at 12700. If the market should again close
     above the moving average before the 12700 buy stop is hit, the setup for this sell
     signal is canceled and the process begins again. In this case, we wait for a new
     setup, confirmation, and sell (or buy) signal, with trade entry at the closest
     natural number. However, if the market trades down to 12700 in this example,
     we will automatically be stopped in a new short position. After being stopped in
     a new sell, the buy stop on this new short position will initially be placed at the
     closest higher natural number (in this case, 12800). After a new trade is
     executed, the stop will be trailed—for a sale, lowered one natural number every
     time a new lower natural number is exceeded below the market until the trend
     turns and the market takes us out. When we’re out, we wait for the next setup,
     confirmation, and signal.

     What Happens After a Trade Is Completed?
     It’s possible to generate a new signal in the same direction (what we call a rebuy
     or a resell), or a new reversal signal (opposite direction) can occur if the market
     reverses direction. It all depends on market action. If the previous trade was a
     buy signal and the market remains above the 180-period WMA, a new buy
     signal is generated at the next-higher natural number. In this case, no setup or
     confirmation is required—only a trade to the next-higher natural number. Or if
     the market continues lower and trades below the 180-period WMA, a new sell
     signal could potentially be generated (after a setup, confirmation, and trade to
     the next-lower natural number). After a trend is established via the setup-and-
     confirmation process, only trades in that direction can take place until a trend




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                   97




    in the opposite direction is established via the setup-and-confirmation process.
    In this way, the natural number method takes advantage of a trend in an attempt
    to squeeze as much profit out of a long-lasting trend as possible. A trend remains
    in force until the market tells us a new trend is established.
        In the real-time example shown in Chart 9.5, the oil market set up at 11244
    and was confirmed at 11258 (above the high of the setup bar), for a new buy
    signal at the next-higher natural number 11300. This is a 15-minute chart, and
    ten bars or 2 1/2 hours later, the buy signal was generated. Within 15 minutes,
    the 11200 stop was hit for a 100-point loss. After being stopped, the market
    remained above the 180-period WMA. Therefore, the system had already set up
    and been confirmed for a rebuy at the next natural number higher (in this case,
    11300 again). After being stopped back in at 11300, we could raise the original
    stop at 11200 to 11300 when the market traded up to 11400, and subsequently
    raise it twice more on this chart. Looking at this chart, we do not know the
    ultimate outcome. The market might continue much higher before a 100-point
    break; however, we can see that the rebuy from 11300 is now sure to return at
    least an approximate 200-point profit (because the raised stop is now working
    at 11500). In conclusion, the first signal correctly identified the prevailing trend,
    but random market action stopped us at a loss. The rebuy bailed us out, and the
    two trades combined during this period resulted in a net profit.

         Is it this easy? When it comes to trading, nothing is ever “this easy,” and I’m
     not trying to present this methodology as the Holy Grail. Even in good periods,
     losing positions will occur, and drawdown periods will also arise during times
     of consolidating (quiet or sideways) markets. However, I’ve found this system
     to normally be quite profitable, and shortly we look at a longer-term series of
     trades to help prove the point.
         The beauty of the method is that natural numbers dictate disciplined money
     management. Our maximum risk is always capped at one level with the upside
     X levels open. For example, corn is priced in dollars and cents per bushel, and
     the natural level is 10¢ per bushel. We will call 10 one unit for this commodity.
     Therefore, if we risk from one natural level in corn to the next, we are risking
     10¢ per trade (for example, 590 to 600), and we’ve capped our maximum risk
     per trade to 10¢, or $500 per contract (plus or minus slippage and fees, which
     are generally minor considerations). In a trending market, our upside per trade
     could be one, two, or three units, or many more. But the point is that the profit
     per trade is not capped at one unit—this could easily be multiple units. Bottom
     line: If we are always risking one unit but have the potential to realize multiple
     units on the profit side of the ledger, then even a 50/50 win-to-loss ratio will
     result in positive bottom-line profitability. And I’ve found that, in the long run,
     with the natural number trading system, a 50/50 or even greater win-to-loss
     ratio (the winning trades outperforming the losers) is the norm and not the
     exception.
         In executing the program, remember that the moving average determines the
     trend. When the market is trading above the average, only a new buy or a rebuy
     can be signaled. When the market is trading below the average, only a new sell or
     a resell can be signaled. A short sale can never take place (regardless of market
     action) above the moving average line, and a buy cannot take place (regardless
     of market action) when the market is trading below the moving average line.
         Now let’s look at how the natural number method performs in a real-time
     market situation. One of the risk disclaimers is that past information is not a
     predictor of future market movements; however, with the N#M, we are using
     past market movements to determine the trend and then using current market
     data for entry signals.
         What follows was not written in hindsight. It took place during the thick of
     the battle. We will follow the corn market beginning in March 2008 and ending
     in August 2008 with a blow-by-blow description of how to use the N#M during
     this period. I couldn’t know beforehand how this market was going to perform.
     As I now know in writing this preview, the market action ended up taking place
     in different directions and didn’t do what I—or anyone else, for that matter—
     could have expected during the period. Unlike many systems or methods you




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    might see advertised, I didn’t retrofit data to prove my theory. I had absolutely
    no idea how the bottom line would ultimately work out when we started on this
    journey in March. (I did it this way because it was an easier way for me to write
    this book. I updated our results during this period most evenings after market
    hours. It was also a good thing to write this in real time because the memory is
    fresh, and I can share the news and emotions that accompany market
    movements as they take place.)
        Before I began, I did have faith in the natural number method. Remember, I
    was not, and we are not, trying to predict the market. In our quest to capture
    profits, we are following the market. And as it turned out in this case, the N#M
    didn’t let us down.
        You will now be able to follow along with a trade-by-trade description of
    what occurred during a real-time market scenario.
        Why did I pick corn? I could have picked any volatile market. I picked corn
    only because it’s a market I actively trade for clients and my own account. I have
    a commercial client who is a huge corn buyer, and I help with hedging strategies,
    but this has nothing to do with the N#M. The method is dynamic—you can
    easily apply it to any actively traded commodity. I knew 2008 had the potential
    for a major move in the corn market (due to lower planted acreage and new
    demand sources). As it turned out, other markets returned many more dollars
    per contract, and I could have shown you a more dramatic bottom line.
    However, corn worked out fine, with lower risk than other markets, and it was
    a good market to illustrate how the N#M works.


        The Corn Campaign
    Our journey begins in late-March 2008, a time when the USA corn crop, grown
    primarily in the Midwest, was in the early planting phase. How the market
    would perform this year would be based on myriad unknown factors at this
    time. How would the growing season unfold, both in the United States and
    internationally? What would the ultimate demand be for livestock feeding and
    industrial uses, such as ethanol and corn syrup?
        Prices at this time were already trading at historic highs for any planting
    period, opening the way for a major bear move (if a large crop was ultimately
    realized) or a substantial bull move (should any weather problems develop).
        Beginning our journey in mid-March, the corn market was in a bear trend,
    trading well under the 180-period weighted moving average (all charts are 30-
    minute bar charts). However, as shown in Chart 9.6, a 30-minute bar was able
    to close above the average on March 24, setting the market up for a buy signal
    at the next natural number (in this case, 540).




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross

      Chart 9.6     March 23–27 (corn 30-minute bar chart)

          Let’s look at this first buy signal, Trade 1, to illustrate how this all works.
          Before the March 24 buy signal, the corn market was in a downtrend. How
      did we know this? Simple: The market was trading below the 180-period WMA,
      as shown in Chart 9.6. On the 12:30 PM Central Standard Time bar (this was 45
      minutes before the closing bell), the market closed above the WMA at 539,
      setting up a potential buy signal (confirmed by trading above the high of the bar,
      or 539) at the next-higher natural number (in this case, 540). Our methodology
      involves placing our buy stop above the market (always place buy stops above
      the market and sell stops below) to enter a new long position at 540. If the
      market had faded into the close and again traded (and bar-closed) under the
      180-period WMA, this setup would have been negated. However, in short order
      the market rallied up to 540, the buy stop was triggered, and a new long position
      was automatically entered. After the order was executed, our next order of
      business was to immediately place our protective sell stop to set our risk point
      on the trade. Our sell stop was placed good until canceled or replaced (GTC) at
      the next-lower natural number (in this case, 530, which is not shown in this
      zoomed-in chart). (See Chart 9.7.) At this time, our trade is placed in the hands
      of the “market gods”; we sit back, monitor the market, and see what unfolds.




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 9.7     March 24 buy signal

        This is what happened: The bull move continued, with the market rising to
    560 on the 25th (when we moved our stop up one natural 10¢ unit, to 550) and
    again up to 570 on the 26th (when we again moved our stop up one unit to
    560). The bull continued without a one-unit (10¢) retracement all the way up
    to 602 on the 31st. By this time, we had raised our stop to 590, and this was the
    stop point that was finally hit on the 31st during the 10:30 AM bar. On the recap
    spreadsheet at the end of this section, this is Trade 1.
        Consider this summary of Trade 1, as shown in Chart 9.8: bought at 540 on
    March 24 and sold at 590 on March 31, with a resulting gain of 50 cents.
    Because one corn contract is sized at 5,000 bushels, every penny move in corn
    per contract represents a $50 profit or loss. In this case, we realized a $2,500
    profit per contract on this trade. (The inevitable fees and any slippage are not
    included in our calculations—these generally amount to approximately 1¢ per
    contract or less.) Because we were risking one unit, which is 10¢, or $500 per
    contract, this represented a 5:1 profit-to-loss ratio on this first trade. Money
    management is automatic. Another way to look at this is that our next five
    signals in a row would all need to be losers to slip us into negative profitability.
    Although this is possible, the odds are against it. We are off to a good start.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross

      Chart 9.8     March 27–April 1

          Now we’re out of the market. What next?
          The first thing to note is that the market remains above the moving average,
      so at this point, we would take only a potential new buy signal (a rebuy).
      Remember, when the market is trading above the average, only a new buy or a
      rebuy is able to be signaled. The next natural number up is 600, so we would
      place a buy stop to reenter at 600.
          However, the market doesn’t move back up to 600. Instead, it continues to
      head south and trades under 580 (at which time we lower our reentry buy stop
      by one 10¢ unit to now enter at 590) and continues trading down as low as
      570.5 (briefly trading under the average). At this point, if the market continued
      lower than 570 and the bar closed below the average (under 570), a potential
      new sell signal (most likely at 560) would have been set up. However, the
      market bounced off the average (a common occurrence in a trending market),
      with the bar closing at 581 near the closing bell on the 31st. This is what I call
      a swing bar, and I’ve identified it on Chart 9.9. This action set up a potential
      new buy signal (a rebuy) at the 590 level, which was hit the following trading
      session. This is Trade 2, a rebuy at 590. This trade was completed when the
      raised stop at 600 was hit on April 6 for a modest 10¢ profit.




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 9.9     April 1–6

        The majority of our trades, regardless of market, for the natural number
    method tend to result in a modest (one-unit) profit or loss, or a break-even. We
    know at the outset that our loss is essentially capped at one unit (or slightly
    above one unit, with slippage), but our upside per trade will be open. If the
    N#M has the capability to maintain our equity (our stake) during the quiet,
    sideways markets and enables us to capitalize on a few big winners during the
    trending periods (down or up), we’ll prosper in the long run.
        On April 7, the program signaled a new short sale at 600, with a reversal
    signal on the 9th at 610. The sell signal (Trade 3) resulted in a 10¢ loss (600 –
    610 = –10). Subsequently, this turned into a reversal buy signal at 610 (Trade
    4), with the raised stop hit overnight on the 10th at 610—the same price as entry
    for a break-even. See Chart 9.10 for a visual summary.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross

      Chart 9.10      April 3–10

         The next trade (5) was a buy, signaled at 620 on the 14th. When the market
      crossed 630 on the 17th, we were able to raise our sell stop to 620. At this point,
      a break-even or small loss would be the worst result. Chart 9.11 shows the stop
      being hit on the 18th, with the market already set up for a reversal signal at 620.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 9.11      April 14–21

       On the 18th, Trade 6 was a new sell signal, at 620. The lowered stop at
    610 hit overnight on the 21st for a 10¢ profit (short from 620, covered at
    610 = +10).

106   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          The next setup came the same day at 623—a setup for a buy signal at the next
      natural number of 630, but this never came. Instead, the market traded back
      under the moving average, set up at 612 on the 22nd, and went to another sell
      signal (a resell) on the 23rd at the 610 natural number. The market moved
      lower, down to 600 on the 24th, enabling us to move our stop to our original
      entry point of 610. This was hit the same day for another break-even (Trade 7),
      as shown in Chart 9.12. To date, we’ve had one big trade; subsequently, our
      account has essentially moved nowhere. Be advised that this is not an
      uncommon occurrence.

       The market continued to chop around. It set up at 618 but never reached the
    620 natural buy signal point. Then it traded back below the moving average, set
    up for a sale at 605, but never reached the 600 natural sell signal point. On the
    27th, the market opened strongly above the average, set up at 617, and
    generated a new buy signal at the 620 natural number (Trade 8). The raised stop
    was hit in the overnight session on the 29th at 630, resulting in a 10¢ profit. See

         Once again, the market proceeded to chop around, with the next sell signal
      on May 5 at 620. The market did move lower, but it stopped at the same price
      the next trading session (Trade 9). Unbeknown to us at this time, we were in the
      midst of a two-month chop period with break-evens and small (one-unit) profits
      and losses. Patience was required, but the important point is that the program
      never allowed us to get into deep trouble. The market continued to chop, with
      a new buy signal on the 7th at 630. This is Trade 10, as shown in Chart 9.14.

      Chart 9.14      May 1–7

          The March–May time period took place during planting. It was very wet in
      a large portion of the Midwest, and this slowed the planting progress. Farmers
      were having trouble getting their crops in the ground, particularly in the key
      growing states of Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. In late-April into May, they had
      approximately a two-week window to plant the corn. If the weather remained
      wet, a massive acreage shift to soybeans would occur. (Farmers can plant beans
      later in the season without appreciable yield loss.) The market chopped around,
      and in early May, certain analysts were calling for a move to 700 or higher.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

    However, the sun came out, the fields dried up, and the Midwestern farmers
    were able to get back in the fields and plant their corn crop. No follow-through
    for the bull market occurred during mid-May, and Trades 11–13 were the
    classic whipsaw (Chart 9.15).

    Chart 9.15      May 7–13

        Trade 11 (on the left side of Chart 9.16) was a sell signal on the 13th and
    was stopped in short order for another break-even to small loss. (Due to
    slippage, the sell signal from 630 was actually filled at 629.) It was too bad this
    stop was hit (the market didn’t go much higher that night) because the market
    then dropped another 20¢, resulting in a resell below the level where we were
    stopped. Remember, when the market is trading below the average, only a new
    sell or a resell can be signaled.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
110   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         The market did manage to subsequently cross above the average line, and
      Trade 13 was entered on the 16th as a buy signal (generated at 630, right at the
      open). This trade was profitable for perhaps a minute. Within a few hours that
      day, the market had set up and reversed to a new sell signal at 620 (on the right
      side of Chart 9.16).

      Chart 9.16      May 12–18

          On the 21st, a new buy at 620 was stopped, and then the N#M reversed our
      direction at the same price on the 27th (see Chart 9.17). The market has been
      fairly tame for a few months now, and at this point, the book and the market
      are getting boring. I still believe corn will be a decent market to illustrate the
      N#M, but I am beginning to wonder if I shouldn’t have picked a more dramatic
      market.

        On May 30, the last trading day of the month, the market opened lower at
    606 and began to rally (right side of Chart 9.18). Within minutes after the open,
    the lowered 610 stop was hit, for a 10¢ profit on the sell from the 27th (Trade
    16). At 10:30 AM CST, the market set up at 610 and went to a new natural
    number buy at 620 by 12:30 PM. The market traded as high as 630 that Friday,
    closing at 626.5—up17¢ for the day. On June 2, the market traded above 640,
    enabling us to raise the stop to 630; however, this stop was hit on a correction
    to just below 630 on June 3.

      Chart 9.18      May 27–June 1

          I hope you’ve been able to follow along to this point, although I realize this
      is becoming a bit tedious. But I thought it was important for you to see the ebb
      and flow of how signals are generated and acted upon. Now it will start to get
      more interesting.
          At this point, in early June, we were out of the market waiting for the next
      signal. If the market had traded and closed under the moving average line, a new
      sell signal would have been generated at either 620 or 630 (depending on the
      placement of the 30-minute close in relation to the average line). However,
      the market remained above the moving average and instead traded back up to
      the natural number 640. Although the previous trade initially resulted in a 10¢
      profit, it ultimately cost us 10¢. If the market had not traded down to 630
      (actually to 629 1/2, a mere half-penny below), we would have still been in this
      trade instead of needing to buy back at 640.
          A dramatic “weather rally” (the first of the season) ensued over the following
      weeks (see Chart 9.19). It continued to rain for a solid week, and 2 million to
      3 million acres of corn remained unplanted. Many farmers were unable to move
      heavy equipment onto their saturated fields. Areas of Iowa experienced what
      were called the 200-year floods, and large portions of Indiana farmland were
      also drowned out. During the next week, corn continued to rally, hitting




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    numerous new all-time highs and slicing through the natural numbers 670, 680,
    and 690. On June 6, the market experienced a 10¢ retracement. Our raised 680
    stop was offset with our previous 640 buy, resulting in a 40¢ profitable trade,
    or $2,000 per contract. This was our 18th trade in about a 2 1/2-month period.

    Chart 9.19      June 2–5

        You can now begin to see how the natural number method is able to capture
    the bigger trending moves—those moves with the best profit potential.
    Remember that I didn’t cherry-pick the corn market to show a good result for
    the book. I preselected corn to illustrate the trading method because I felt the
    market had the potential to make a move during the time I was writing this
    book, and it’s a market that I trade actively anyway. I had no prior knowledge
    of how the market would trade before writing this chapter. As you will see, it all
    worked out nicely. But then again, after extensively testing and trading the
    method, I do have faith in it. It’s dynamic, and it works over a wide variety of
    markets. Let me digress a bit at this point (we’ll come back to the corn story)
    and show you the awesome potential the method has in the right situation.
    Certainly, this system has good and poor periods. It tends to work best in
    volatile or trending situations—where the big money is made. Sometimes it
    works spectacularly. If I cherry-picked an example to showcase the potential of




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
114   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      the natural number method, it would be one similar to the following. At the
      same time we were trading corn, many commodities were simultaneously
      making major moves. As you can imagine, the soybean market was moving in a
      similar manner to corn because corn and beans are grown in the same areas, and
      the weather was having an adverse effect on the soybean plantings as well.
      Actually, the bottom-line numbers of the N#M for soybeans far exceeded the
      ones for corn during this period. (We used different parameters to trade the
      beans, as discussed later in the chapter.) Nonagricultural markets (for example,
      currencies and metals) were working nicely with the program, too. But perhaps
      the most volatile, risky, and potentially profitable (if you were on the right side)
      market at this time was crude oil. A trader could accomplish more in a few days
      in oil than he or she could previously do in a year. For example, look at crude
      oil on June 5–6 on Chart 9.20 (admittedly cherry-picked, but totally accurate).
      This was a period when oil, similar to corn, was registering all-time-high prices
      in a dramatic bull trend. The natural number method works exactly the same
      way for oil as it does for corn. The only difference is that we use a more sensitive
      10-minute chart (for reasons that will be outlined later) versus the 30-minute
      chart we used for the corn market. The moving average is the same: 180-period
      weighted. The natural number for oil is the rounded dollar per barrel, 10000,
      or $100/barrel, 10100, or $101/barrel, 10200, or $102/barrel, and so forth. On
      June 5 oil crossed above the moving average line to generate a new buy signal
      at 12400, or $124 per barrel. A crude oil contact is for 1,000 barrels; therefore,
      every dollar move represents $1,000 profit or loss per contract traded. After the
      buy signal, the market ran up to 12700 in just a few hours. This amounted to an
      unrealized profit of $3,000 per contract traded—frankly, it would have been
      tempting to book the profit. However, the system had not backed us out, and,
      remember, the $3 move up enabled us to raise our stop to the next-lower natural
      number (in this case, 12600, or $126/barrel), thus ensuring an approximate
      $2,000 profit per contract traded. If we had accepted $3,000 profit per
      contract, however, we would have left something on the table.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Chart 9.20      June 5–6 oil

        During the following 24 hours, this market ran another $6 before the first
    trailing stop was hit. Early the next morning, oil reached an unbelievable price
    (at that time) of $134 per barrel. At that point, our stop had been raised to $133,
    where it was hit for an incredible $9,000 profit on just one contract ($133 –
    $124 = 9 × $1,000). But wait—it was early on June 6 and if a trader had stuck
    to the program, he would have entered the rebuy at the 134 natural number and
    ridden this one up to 139. Then the trailing stop at 138 would have been hit for
    a second trade in two days, this one amounting to an additional $4,000 profit
    on each contract traded. Two signals in two days amounting to a gross profit of
    $13,000, or $130,000 for a 10-contact trader, $1.3 million for 100-contract
    trades, and so on. Certainly, this was a premier move, but trust me: Many more
    took place in oil and other markets this year, and plenty of others will occur in
    the future.

         Let’s get back to our corn campaign, as we’ve now traveled from late March
      into early June 2008, stacking up some profits along the way. Chart 9.21 begins
      on June the 5.

           Chart 9.21      June 5–10

              We are now out of the market, having accepted a 40¢ profit on Trade
           18. At this point, we would reenter either on the short side after a new
           setup well below the market, or on a move back up to the next-higher
           natural number, 690. I suspected it would be a rebuy, and a new buy at 690
           was triggered on Sunday evening (see Chart 9.22), June 8 (or at the open
           on Monday morning if the Sunday-evening market were not being
           monitored).

    Chart 9.22      June 8–11

       On Tuesday the 10th, corn futures traded above $7 per bushel (the 700
    master natural number) for the first time in history. In classic Livermore fashion,
    December corn quickly ran up the 30¢ limit on June 11, enabling us to raise our
    stop three additional times and “locking in” an additional 30¢ profit during just
    that one trading session (Chart 9.23).




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross

      Chart 9.23      June 11–13

           After the limit up move, the market was fairly wild. December corn traded
      up to a new all-time high above 750; then the market broke 20¢, stopping us
      out at 740. We received a fairly nice 50¢ gain, or $2,500 profit per contract.
           Once again we could have gone either way, but it was a bull market. And
      after the move under 730, we again got stopped in on the long side at 740,
      raised the stop to 740 on the move to 750, and were stopped out at 740 (all in
      the same day). For those of you keeping score, we have just completed Trade
      20. The sentiment was very bullish at this point in time, and nobody could have
      predicted what was to transpire in the coming few months.
           Granted, Chart 9.23 has a lot going on, and if you’re having trouble following
      it, perhaps now is a good time to review our rules. It’s really quite systematic and
      fairly simple to execute the strategy when you understand the rules.
           To review, after being sell-stopped out at 680 on June 6, the market rallied
      and we were buy-stopped into a new long position at the next-higher natural
      number (in this case, 690). From this buy point all the way up to 750, no 10¢
      retracement occurred to stop us out of this long position. Every time the market
      rallied higher to reach a new higher natural number, we were able to raise our
      stop by 10¢. The first full 10¢ break came after the 750 natural number was
      reached, stopping us out at 740 and enabling us to accept a realized 50¢ profit
      on the 690 buy.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  119




        Now it’s June 12 and we’re flat (out of the market, with no position), waiting
    for the next signal. Once again, this turned out to be a buy at 740. The market
    then proceeded to rally and break back down all in the same session, and we
    went home flat for the day after a weak close. On Friday the 13th, the market
    opened strongly higher once again after reports of flooding throughout Cedar
    Rapids, Iowa, with 24,000 residents evacuated from their homes. As a result, we
    were immediately stopped back into the long side, this time at 750 (Chart 9.24).
    The market rallied all that day, closing at 765 (a new record-high close) and
    enabling us to raise our stop. Going home that weekend, our position was long
    from 750, with our stop working at 750 and the 180-period weighted moving
    average rising but still well under the current market, at 727. Over the weekend,
    I recalled the 1993 floods (which had also been called the worst floods in 200
    years) and the effect they had on the markets. Soybeans that year peaked on July
    19, the very day Newsweek ran a front-page cover photo of a flood victim up to
    his head in water. The market then proceeded to trade lower for the rest of that
    year. With all the bullish news, I wondered if the market was making a top or
    whether it could continue to surge higher yet.

    Chart 9.24      June 11–16




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
120   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          On Monday the 16th, the market opened above 790, setting new record-
      highs again. Trade 21 (entered the previous Friday) was quickly stopped, albeit
      at a mere 40¢ profit. Chart 9.24 might appear messy due to all the activity, but
      notice how the moving average is traveling smoothly with the market. In four
      trading days, it moved up from 688 to 748, illustrating what a dynamic indicator
      this truly is in a fast-moving market and how the system works to minimize our
      risk in this scenario.
          Due to the increased volume and volatility that news tends to create, eight
      more trades occurred through June 25 (Trades 22–29): four entered at the same
      770 natural numbers. Four of these eight resulted in 10¢ losses, three in break-
      evens, and one in a 10¢ profit. It was a very choppy period, with numerous
      whipsaws and a chart too messy to picture. In hindsight, we now know that the
      market was in the process of topping out, and erratic choppy action is one
      symptom of this phase. The beauty of N#M is its inherent money management.
      Even though we saw four times as many losses as profits during this two-week
      period, our drawdown was manageable. If you had consistently taken the signals
      in the previous few weeks, this drawdown came off profits.
          This brings us to the question, “What is the recommended minimum account
      size to trade the natural number method?”
          What if you had the unfortunate luck to start at the worst possible time (in
      this period that would have been Trade 22 on June 16 )? Your drawdown would
      have been about $1,500 per contract traded (slightly higher if you add in fees
      and slippage). Even with a modest account, assuming you don’t overtrade more
      contracts than the equity can handle during the down periods, a drawdown of
      this size is manageable. My recommendation is to trade one contract per signal
      for a market similar to corn (a risk of approximately $500 per contract per
      trade) for each $10,000 in equity. For markets in which the risk per trade is
      higher (risk per trade is discussed later in this chapter), I recommend a larger-
      sized account. For a market in which the projected risk per trade is $1,000 per
      contract, I recommend a $20,000 minimum account size. If your starting equity
      is $100,000, you then have the option to diversify, which I recommend. For
      example, trade five unrelated markets: three markets with a projected risk of
      $1,000 risk per contract per trade and two markets with a projected risk of $500
      per contract per trade, with two contracts per trade.
          Getting back to our corn campaign, we are now on a reversal buy (moved
      back from the short to the long side) for Trade 30, and although we didn’t know
      it at the time the trade was entered, our drawdown period had ended. Since the
      campaign started about three months ago, this had been the worst cumulative
      drawdown period, still manageable for all but the very smallest of accounts.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  121




    Trade 30 resulted in a $1,000 profit but was literally inches away from gener-
    ating a much larger profit. The market had an interim peak at the all-time high
    price of 799 1/4 that week, and if it had been just .75¢ higher (or 3/4 of one
    penny), we would have raised our stop by 10¢ and ensured a larger profit on the
    trade. Subsequently, this trade was “just” stopped when the market dipped to
    780 on the 27th. This was unfortunate because it just touched the stop point and
    then the rebuy was signaled during the same trading session (a Friday), at 10¢
    higher. However, we were still able to raise the stop twice during that trade,
    resulting in a 20¢ profit (see Chart 9.25). We couldn’t know it at the time, but
    799 1/4 would be the contract high. The master natural number 800 was never
    hit or exceeded—a strong signal of major resistance.

    Chart 9.25      June 24–27

        The Friday rebuy was unfortunate because it came before the crop report
    released on Monday, June 30. This report was released before the market
    opened and was a bearish shocker for corn. The government reported planted
    acreage at more than 87 million, which was above the March intentions number
    and a surprise to most traders (including me), who were looking for a big
    reduction in planted acres due to the flooding. The market gapped lower and
    our 780 stop was filled at 773 1/4, nearly 7¢ under the stop price. This is a good
    example of negative slippage, which occurs when a major surprise hits a market.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
122   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      The tone was changing; the market then continued lower, generating a new sell
      signal at 770—the next natural number under the 180-period WMA. In short
      order, December corn broke below 740, enabling us to lower our stop three
      times in two days. On July 1, the lowered 750 stop was hit for a 20¢ profit,
      which more than offset the previous losing trade (see Chart 9.26).

      Chart 9.26      June 26–July 1

          The market then moved higher, reversing to a new buy signal at 770 on July
      2: Stop raised to 770, stop hit, rebuy at 780, and stop hit at 770 for a 10¢ loss
      in a volatile session. This was a classic test of the high that would ultimately fail
      with another rebuy and stop hit, for another 10¢ loss. This can be quite trying,
      particularly in a weather market scenario, and you need to be disciplined to stick
      with the program. Up to this point, the volatility had been remarkable consid-
      ering the fact that weather markets generally don’t even begin until after the July
      4th holiday. After July 4 is often considered a pivot point for the corn market.
      This time period often points the way for the remainder of the summer. The
      trend this year had been up. Returning from the holiday, you would expect
      either a change in trend (if the market weakens from this area) or a continuation
      of the bull trend to new highs above $8 per bushel.

    Chart 9.27      July 2–8

        A change in trend is exactly what happened. On July 7 the first trading day
    after the July 4th holiday, the market opened sharply lower. Note how Trade
    36 was triggered: The first setup was 749 1/2, under the 750 natural number,
    setting up a sell signal at the next-lower natural number of 740. However, the
    market proceeded to rally to 760; therefore, the next sell signal setup could
    actually be raised to 750 (the next lower natural number). If the market had
    traded above the 180-period WMA line, it could easily have set up for a new buy
    signal, most likely at 770. However, corn was heavy that day and sank back to
    750 for a fresh sell signal. It closed that day at the 30¢ limit down level of 747.
    Apparently, the pivot was pointing south. The first 10¢ retracement from a
    natural number was on the 8th at 720, resulting in a 30¢ profit for that trade
    (see Chart 9.27).




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
124   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         During the remainder of that week, the market traded essentially sideways,
      resulting in a break-even trade (see Chart 9.28). However, note how the moving
      average fell 40¢ that week from 755 to 715—additional evidence of how the
      program is self-adjusting.

      Chart 9.28      July 9–11

          What if a market gaps up or down above or below a natural number? If it has
      already set up, consider this your confirmation and take the trade at the market.
      Generally, a gap is caused by an unexpected event, such as a geopolitical event,
      a weather event, or an economic or crop report. For example, Trade 38 was
      triggered at the natural number 700 due to a gap open lower (caused by an
      inaccurate weather forecast—it was wet and cool, not hot and dry). This trade
      was filled at 696 and subsequently stopped at a small profit (after a sharp break
      that enabled the stop to be lowered to 690). In this case, the gap only led to a
      choppy trade that was stopped out for a small profit, followed by a resale for a
      loss and another resale at the same price for a 10¢ profit (see Chart 9.29).
          However, pay attention to gap action because gaps sometimes signal the start
      of a major move.

    Chart 9.29      July 11–16

        Let me stress again that choppy periods will occur and will test your
    patience. You need to believe in the program and keep your faith to stick it out.
    This is where diversification can help; when one market is in a consolidation
    (sideways) pattern, another might be trending. As it turned out, during this
    period, when we were getting chopped up a bit in corn, other unrelated markets
    were trending nicely. For example, let’s briefly digress again to the oil market.
    Remember that big bull move approximately a month earlier? On July 15, the
    oil market collapsed, and the program (we are using a 10-minute chart for oil)
    generated a sell signal that resulted in a $7,000 profit on just one contract in less
    than one hour’s trading (with a maximum initial risk of $1,000). You now know
    how it works; Chart 9.30 shows what it looked like.

      Diversification
      A few thoughts on diversification: When trading the natural number method, I
      recommend diversifying into a minimum of three unrelated markets. These
      markets should be broad and liquid, to allow for stop orders with minimal
      slippage. Although this rule is not written in stone and I believe that you can
      make money using this methodology trading just one or two markets, this
      generally takes longer and requires greater patience, particularly if you start at
      the wrong time. The premise is that the greater the diversification, the greater
      the chance of catching a major move somewhere. At any point in time, one
      market might be in a major uptrend and one might be in a major downtrend,
      with a third trendless. N#M works because the major moves will be profitable
      enough to offset the inevitable smaller losses inherent in those choppy market
      situations. The odds of catching major moves increase with the number of
      markets traded. One caveat: They should be unrelated markets. Although the
      Swiss franc and the euro can move in opposite directions sometimes, they
      generally move in the same direction (albeit at different speeds) in relation to




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  127




    the dollar. Soybeans and soybean oil can move in opposite directions (and they
    sometimes have, in the short run), but because they are directly related products,
    they generally move in the same direction (albeit at different speeds). In picking
    the optimal markets to trade, I personally like those that traditionally have the
    tendency for more dramatic moves (instead of the slower movers) because the
    more volatile markets will have moves large enough to overcome the inevitable
    trendless periods when you consider the inherent costs of commissions and
    slippage. For example, I generally prefer corn to oats because of corn’s greater
    volatility. I like markets with good volume and major commercial participation
    (for example, the grains and the energies). The commercial interests and hedge
    funds have deeper pockets and tend to support their positions longer. Consider
    trading one currency because currencies generally trend nicely. Any of the major
    currencies (the euro, the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, or
    the Japanese yen) work well. I also prefer to trade a grain, and I personally
    prefer soybeans (technically not a grain, but an oilseed) or corn because they
    both can trend nicely and possess sufficient volatility. Finally, I recommend that
    you consider rounding off your portfolio with a metal (my personal preference
    is gold) and a financial, such as a stock index or interest-rate product.
        The natural number method is dynamic—theoretically, it works over time if
    used systematically on a variety of unrelated markets or any single market.
    However, my experience has been that thin markets, such as lumber and
    platinum, place the odds against us at the start because the fills will often be
    disappointing.
        Sometimes our stops will just be hit and sometimes they will just be missed.
    As examples, Trade 41 (a resell from 670; see Chart 9.31) appeared to be one
    of those trades doomed from the start because the market immediately went the
    wrong way, trading as high as 679 1/2. Just as it appeared we would be stopped
    on this trade at a loss, the market headed south again, and the trade resulted in
    a 10¢ profit. It didn’t go much above the 660 (lowered) stop before crashing
    another 90¢, with the next new short sale signaled at 650 (see Chart 9.31).
    Bottom line: These “justs” (just getting stopped, just missing a profit) appear to
    even out over time. It’s a function of the “market gods” and is not within our
    control.

      Chart 9.31      July 16–22

          Trade 42 turned out to be our best trade of the campaign. We were able to
      lower the stop eight times before finally being stopped out on the 23rd at 580
      (see Charts 9.31 & 9.32). The result was $3,500 profit per contract taking place
      in only five trading days. With the floods in the news a few weeks ago, who
      would have thought our best trade to date would be from the short side? The
      news this time was “perfect weather,” with (this coming almost out of thin air)
      a bountiful corn crop in development, the flood-ravaged crop of the previous
      month seemingly forgotten. The truth is, the majority of analysts we followed
      did not see this route coming. This big bear move was partially in sympathy,
      with a broadly based commodity sell-down (lead by weak oil during this period),
      and also largely created by margin-call selling. Once again, as Soros has taught
      us, money became the most important fundamental. The natural number
      method is not concerned with fundamentals—only market action; the market
      action led us by using N#M to sell when scores of others were buying—and it
      worked.

    Chart 9.32      July 21–25

        After a major move, the market will often consolidate. The market did
    become choppy again, resulting in the inevitable whipsaw with two 10¢ losing
    trades in quick succession. On July 25, the program generated its first new buy
    signal since July 3. At this point, we have no way of knowing whether this will
    be the start of a new bull trend or whether the consolidation will continue. We
    see indications that the bear move might have run its course. However, after the
    July 25 signal, the weather forecast was constantly changing from perfect to hot,
    but plenty of rain mitigated the heat, and the conditions remained good. The
    market chopped back and forth with the changing weather forecasts. Trades
    44–48 (not pictured) did not help us with three losses, one break-even, and one
    profit during this choppy period.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
130   The New Commodity Trading Guide




         Let’s digress and take a look at the big picture by reviewing the daily chart
      (Chart 9.33) since the campaign began. Besides reviewing our theories, let’s
      consider certain other indicators.




      Source: CQG, Inc. © 2008 All rights reserved worldwide.

      Chart 9.33      Daily corn (late-March–late-July)

         Looking at the daily chart for the period during this corn campaign, we can
      now see that this crop year exhibited all three possible trend scenarios. The
      April–May period was a sideways trend, June exhibited a classic uptrend, and
      July was a classic downtrend. This is all easy to see in hindsight. As the saying
      goes, “Hindsight is always 20/20”—however, in the thick of the battle, it’s not
      always easy to determine the major trend. The overall profitability that has been
      demonstrated throughout all three scenarios is a testament to the power of the
      N#M.
         As we apply it, the N#M works on a shorter-term time frame. Because of the
      volatility that results from electronic trading, I advocate using a shorter-term
      time frame for trading. However, I am not suggesting that you rely on just a
      single indicator. Analyzing the market in the context of longer-term time frames
      and alternative technical indicators will assist our trading and enhance
      profitability.




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  131




        Let’s now briefly discuss using the 50-day EMA, the RSI, and Open Interest
    to improve your analysis and supplement the N#M. But first let me draw your
    attention to the master natural numbers 600 and 700.
        Most of the volume is in the electronic corn market (the market we use in
    our trading); however, I used the daily pit-traded chart in Chart 9.33 to illus-
    trate a point. The pit-traded corn market is open for just 3 hours and 45 minutes
    during the day and removes the overnight “noise.” Because the electronic trades
    in the evening, as well as during the pit hours, are affected by overnight news,
    its action sets the tone for the morning open. As a result, a greater number of
    gap opens are seen on the pit corn chart. If the news is dramatic or unexpected,
    the market can gap above the high of the previous day or below the low of the
    previous day.
        I’ve drawn a horizontal line at the master natural numbers 600 and 700. Let’s
    discuss 600 first. On April 2, 2008, the actively traded December corn contract
    broke above 600 and closed at 603—the first close above 600 in the history of
    corn futures trading. Take a look at how 600 then acted as major support. For
    the following two months, although the market essentially moved sideways, this
    number acted as a major support, with the market continually bouncing off this
    master number. Until the market embarked on the next major leg higher in June,
    it was never again able to close under 600. Then on June 10, for the first time
    in the history of corn futures trading, the market broke above 700, closing at
    702 3/4. This was a classic Livermore-type signal. If he were alive and trading,
    Livermore would have no doubt been a buyer on that first close above this
    master natural number. During the next trading session, the market gapped
    sharply higher (it opened at 715) and never looked back. The next-higher
    master natural number was 800. I have no doubt that this number will be
    breached at some point in the future; however, at the date of this writing, 800
    ($8 per bushel) has not been traded on the U.S. corn futures market. The all-
    time high price remains 799 1/4 (traded on the electronic market). So if you buy
    our theory, waiting for a breach of 800 to buy at that level saved us from buying
    at a high. When 700 was exceeded, the old rule that former resistance should
    act as support came into play. Therefore, you would expect 700 to hold on the
    correction. However, on July 14, the pit-traded corn gapped below 700 to open
    at 684. If you were trading the electronic market that evening, you would have
    been a step up on this new short sale (or liquidating a stale long position) on an
    exit (long) or entry (short) on the break below 700. However, even if you had
    waited for the pit market to confirm weakness, selling on this open (the sharp
    gap below 700) proved to be the right move. During the next seven trading
    sessions, the market traded sharply lower, almost in a straight line, ending below




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
132   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      600. This action is a testament to the power of master natural numbers. Pay
      attention to them because this simple concept is a powerful indicator of future
      market action.


      The 50-Day EMA
      Many trading funds use natural number (exponential, simple, and weighted)
      moving averages, particularly the 100-day, 200-day, and 50-day. I superim-
      posed the 50-day exponential moving average line on Chart 9.33. I prefer
      weighted and exponential moving averages to the simple moving average;
      however, all moving averages are useful tools for trend determination, albeit
      lagging indicators. (If you’re not familiar with the differences among the various
      moving averages and how they’re calculated, see the Moving Average Primer in
      the Appendix, “A Moving Average Primer, an Open Interest Primer, and the
      Advanced Open Interest Course.”) In Chart 9.33, the market remained above
      the 50-day EMA on a closing basis during the first 13 weeks of this chart. May
      29 was the only day during this period when it traded below, but it was able to
      close “above the line” on that day. It is no coincidence that the market was
      primarily in an uptrend during this period. After the market closed below the
      50-day EMA, the market continued lower in almost a straight line. This is a
      lagging indicator, and we can see in hindsight that the market had peaked June
      27 at just below $8. It didn’t close below the 50-day EMA until July 14 at below
      $7. Our N#M is much more sensitive. (It moved into sell mode on July 7 at
      $7.50.) Still, the 50-day EMA (as well as other longer-term averages) is worth
      charting on a daily basis to provide additional evidence of the major trend and
      help place us on the right side of the market.


      The RSI
      The RSI is a useful tool that is popular with traders as an overbought or oversold
      indicator. Welles Wilder developed the RSI in the late-1970s. You’ll hear
      brokers, advisory firms, newsletters, and others touting the words oversold and
      overbought. This is what they’re talking about: Markets don’t go straight up or
      straight down forever without corrective moves. A point comes when the
      market is ready to turn and change trend (or correct if still within a major trend)
      because the buying or selling has been temporarily satiated. Overbought
      basically means the market is too high and is running out of buyers for the
      move—ready to fall from its own weight. Oversold is the reverse: The market is
      too low for the move, running out of sellers (at least, for the current time period)




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  133




    and ready for a bounce. These are not very scientific terms and are used
    arbitrarily. The RSI attempts to statistically quantify the degree to which a
    market is overbought or oversold.
         For you mathematicians, the formula is as follows:
         RSI = 100 – (100 / [1+RS])
         where RS = Average of net up closing changes for N number of days /
    Average of net-down closing changes for N number of days.
         The trader selects the number of days; 9 is the standard, or default, in most
    programs.
         The RSI can range from just above 0 to just below 100, but it is extremely
    rare to see a number very close to either of these extremes. In a normal market
    situation, the RSI spends most of its time fluctuating between 25 and 75. The
    market is generally considered oversold at less than 25 and overbought at more
    than 75. How do you use the RSI? When this number gets too small or too big,
    it is theoretically time to put up your antenna. The market is getting close to a
    reversal point. Some traders attempt to buy when the RSI wanders into the
    oversold range and sell in the overbought range. My opinion is that if you
    attempt to do this, you’d better have deep pockets. Sometimes (for example, in
    trading-range type markets) this can be an excellent way to pick tops and
    bottoms. However, in the major moves and at extremes (the most profitable
    time for the trend follower), the RSI can remain in the extreme ranges for long
    periods of time and for potentially large moves. This is the major drawback of
    the RSI. It works in normal markets, but when the market is in the blow-off or
    panic stage, it can remain in overbought or oversold territory for an extended
    period and can become quite costly.
         Still, I think the RSI can be a useful tool, particularly when used in
    conjunction with other indicators and the N#M. You need to know what type
    of market you are in (trading-range or trending, young or mature). If you can
    determine this, the RSI can help you identify what point in the life cycle of the
    market you’re at. RSIs tend to get high in the mature stages of a bull market and
    low in the mature stages of a bear market, but no magic number signals the
    bottom. In fact, I’ve found it is better practice to watch for the RSI to turn up
    after it falls under 25 to signal a bottom, and vice versa for the bull. Yet even this
    tactic tends to lead to numerous false and money-losing signals because the RSI
    is a coincident indicator: It moves with price. A minor upswing has to turn the
    RSI up.
         As I suggested in my previous books, the best way to use RSI is to look for
    divergences. These occur when the RSI doesn’t make a new low or a new high
    coincidentally with the market. For example, let’s suppose coffee rallies from
    128 to 158; the RSI registers a high for the move of 83 at 158 (so it is in




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
134   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      overbought territory). The market then falls back to 152, a normal correction,
      and the RSI falls back to 71. Subsequently, the coffee market continues its
      bullish ways and reaches a new high of 161. Up to this point, the RSI has moved
      with price. Every day coffee registered a new closing high for the move, so did
      the RSI. However, on this occasion, the RSI moved up to only 79, a lower high.
      The market made a new high; the RSI made a lower high: This is classic diver-
      gence, and I’ve found that the best signals come from RSI divergence. Some
      terrific signals come from triple divergence, where the market makes a third
      higher high or third lower low, while the RSI makes a third lower high or third
      higher low. And, yes, I’ve seen quadruple divergence and even more diver-
      gences, but these do not always occur at turning points. Bottom line: You should
      look at this daily because it can give you some useful information, but I would
      use the RSI as a confirming indicator only, not as a stand-alone trading method.
          Take a look at the RSI readings on our corn chart in Chart 9.33. The RSI first
      moved into overbought territory (above 75) on June 9 at 685. We can put up
      our antenna, but the trend remained strongly up, and the RSI continued to move
      higher with the market. The RSI peaked at an extremely high overbought
      reading of 90 on June 18 at a closing price of 780, and the market made a higher
      high on June 26–27, with the RSI showing divergence (lower reading of 75).
      The RSI worked beautifully in this case, signaling the top well before other
      indicators. The market and the RSI then both proceeded to move lower, with
      the RSI first reaching oversold territory below 25 on July 18 (close of 628 1/2).
      The RSI reached a low of 17 on July 22 at 592. At this point in time, we have
      no way of knowing whether the low for the move has been registered; however,
      the oversold reading has our antenna up looking for other indicators to confirm
      that the low is, in fact, in. Our first new buy for the N#M in 22 days came on
      July 25 at major number 600, and we can see other clues that a new bull trend
      might potentially be in its infancy. Bottom line: I have found the RSI to be an
      extremely useful tool and recommend that you add it to your technical toolbox,
      particularly because it provides information the lagging indicators can’t.


      Open Interest (OI)
      This is a powerful technical forecasting tool available only to futures trades. For
      a full discussion of what open interest is and how it works (including my six
      profit rules for analyzing open interest), see the appendix.
         In Chart 9.34, open interest did provide valuable forecasting information. It
      peaked on June 13 at 1,433,923 contracts (labeled as the OI peak). The close on
      that date was 765. The market continued to rally until June 27 (as high as
      799 1/2 in the electronic market and 796 in the pit market); however, during




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
9   The Natural Number Method: A Breakthrough Strategy for Capturing Market Profits                  135




    this last surge to new highs, OI was falling (down almost 100,000 contracts to
    1,343,348 on that date). This is my Rule 3: If prices are in an uptrend and open
    interest is falling, this is a bearish sign. OI analysis gave us an excellent warning
    sign that the internal strength of the market was actually weak at the very point
    that it looked the strongest.

    Chart 9.34      Daily corn (May–July) with OI

        OI then continued to fall, bottoming on June 10 at 1,273,928. (This is
    labeled the OI trough.) On this date, the market had fallen about a dollar from
    the top, with about 160,000 contracts liquidated out, but then OI once again
    began to rise. If the market had turned back up, this would have been a bullish
    sign; however, it continued lower while OI rose. This was an excellent bearish
    indication, as outlined in my Rule 2: If prices are in a downtrend and open
    interest is rising, this is a bearish sign.
        This rise in OI peaked on July 18 at 1,313,707 and then declined to new
    lows by the end of the chart (the end of July). According to Rule 4, this is a
    bullish leading indicator: If prices are in a downtrend and open interest is falling,
    this is a bullish leading indicator. However, this is just a leading indicator and
    can be off by weeks. (Rule 4 was a great leading indictor of the top, but it took
    two weeks of declining OI before the top was made.) We would like to see
    evidence of Rule 1 to indicate that the bottom is, in fact, in place. However,




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
136   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      realize that markets can remain oversold for weeks until the last weak long has
      liquidated his position.
          Here we are after a break of greater than $2 (and I am old enough to
      remember when a bushel of corn was trading below $2) with the market still in
      a major downtrend; however, OI might have bottomed. This is what I was
      looking for, that ringing bell Rule 1: If prices now start rising again, with open
      interest rising with it, this is a bullish indicator. Our natural number method
      (smarter than the human being) was on a sell signal at this time (Trade 49 from
      the master natural number 600). The trend is your friend, and we do not fight
      the trend, but I was thinking, wouldn’t it now look bullish if the RSI was
      oversold, the OI was looking potentially bullish, and the N#M could turn to a
      new buy signal at or above the 600 master natural number? After all, this is the
      same crop that was devastated by flooding this past spring, and cheap prices
      don’t tend to curb demand, right? However, these are fundamentals, and funda-
      mentals are logical—but the market is always right.
          This is what actually happened (as shown in Chart 9.35): Trade 48 was a sell
      signal at the master natural number 600. It lasted for a mere three trading days,
      but it was good for a 50¢ profit from the short side during that time—another
      50¢ taken out of the short side from a market that had already dropped 200¢,
      proving once again that the method was smarter than I was.

       The market turned choppy during the following week, with four resells—
    two for 10¢ profits and two for 10¢ losses.
       This was a period of massive liquidation, not only in corn, but also across a
    variety of commodities. Oil had now dropped $30 per barrel from the top in just
    one month (or $30,000 per contract traded), and soybeans collapsed $2 per
    bushel in a week (or $10,000 per contract traded). N#M performed quite well,
    with the majority of profits from the short side during the worst six-week
    performance period on record for many hedge fund managers. A number of
    hedge funds that were heavily invested in commodities suffered heavy losses and
    had to close their doors after this rout. The evidence was in the OI figures that
    didn’t rise as we would have liked to see for a bottom; instead, they continued
    to plummet to new low levels, as shown in Chart 9.36.

        The RSI remained oversold and was showing some evidence of divergence
    (seen at the bottoms), but the N#M remained in a sell mode. (The next setup at
    this time was above the market, at 540.) OI Rule 4 still told us to be alert for a
    bottom at any time, plus a major crop report was due out on August 12. Before
    the crop report, N#M has us flat, out of the market.

          The crop report was considered bearish. The trade was looking for a crop
      estimate below 12 billion bushels, but the actual number came out well above
      this. The early calls on the 12th were sharply lower. And the market did open
      lower, stopping us into a new sell signal at 510—the lowest-signaled number of
      the corn campaign to date (see Chart 9.37).

      Chart 9.37      August 11–14

         Remember the August 11, 1995, bearish crop report that led me to construct
      my significant news indicator? This is the same August report, 13 years later.
      The close on the day before this crop report was 517; therefore, this number
      became our SNI (see Chart 9.38).

    Chart 9.38      December 2008 corn (daily through August 14)

        After the release of this very bearish report, the market traded to new lows
    for the campaign early in the session, down to 505. However, as soon as the
    market crossed above 517 (our SNI), this was a bullish signal. Our stop had
    already been hit on Trade 54 (the short from 510), and that day the market
    closed at 528 1/2. N#M signaled a new buy the next day at 540, with the market
    subsequently closing up the 30¢ limit that day and adding another 19¢ the
    following day. Bottom line: The SNI, with virtually zero risk, offered the
    potential for more than 60¢ ($3,000 per contract] profit in just a few days.



        Summary
    The corn campaign began in late March when I began to write this chapter. It’s
    now mid-August and near my editor’s deadline, so it’s a good time to recap
    where we’ve been and how the N#M performed overall. It actually performed
    splendidly (we’ll get to the actual numbers shortly), but first a review.




                                                                                      From the Library of Kerri Ross
140   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          During this five-month period, we saw 56 trades: 28 were from the long side
      and 28 were from the short side. I didn’t plan it this way, and I was a little
      surprised at the equal number of trades from each side. This period did contain
      all the possible trend scenarios: uptrends, downtrends, and sideways trends (see
      Chart 9.39).

      time to conclude our commentary for the corn campaign to date. Table 9.1

144   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      How the Entry and Exit Prices and Return-Per-Contract Results
      Are Determined
      These prices, in my experience and best judgment, are honest prices that would
      have been received in the marketplace based on market conditions. If you had
      decided to act on a particular trade, your entry or exit price might have been
      better or worse. It’s also possible, depending on market conditions, that you
      would not have been able to enter a trade (even if I were able to). I believe that
      all the reported prices are accurate representations of what could actually be
      received in the marketplace. However, consider these results hypothetical—and
      hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which
      are described later. I am not making a representation that any account will
      achieve or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact,
      sharp differences frequently arise between hypothetical performance results
      and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
      One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are
      generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
      trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can
      completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For
      example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading
      program in spite of trading losses is a material point that can also adversely
      affect actual trading results. Numerous other factors related to the markets in
      general or to the implementation of any specific trading program cannot be fully
      accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results, but they
      can adversely affect actual trading results.
          The return-per-contract dollar figure on closed trades is based on one
      contract only. If you trade multiple contracts, multiply this number accordingly.
      The dollar figure is a gross profit or loss per single contract. (Commissions and
      any other fees are not subtracted because they would vary by trader.) Bottom
      line: I think I have fairly presented the gross returns (sans fees) that could
      actually be obtained; however, results could vary. Remember that it is impos-
      sible for me or anyone to guarantee the future because we are largely dealing
      with the unknown. Read the earlier risk disclaimer again; if you are uncom-
      fortable with the risks involved here, you should not be doing this.
          As of the end of the campaign, the margin required to trade one corn
      contract was $2,025. Therefore, based on margin, or even an account of
      nominal size, you might agree that $17,400 gross profit (minus commissions
      and fees) is an excellent return for a single contract traded over a period of less
      than half a year.

        Additional Trading Points for N#M
    Determining the Time Interval
    For the corn campaign, we utilized a 30-minute bar. However, as mentioned
    previously, the bar length is a variable. How do we determine the right time
    interval to use for each bar? Remember that, as volatility increases, the timing
    of each decision point needs to decrease. Therefore, we would use a longer time
    bar for the calmer markets and progressively shorter time bars as volatility
    increases.
        Volatility varies with markets but also with conditions. Some markets are
    traditionally more volatile than others. Every market has its own personality.
    Soybeans are generally more volatile than corn, and cocoa is generally more
    volatile than sugar. This is partly a function of price, but also a function of each
    market’s players. The more speculative the market, the more attractive it
    becomes to higher-risk speculators. Additionally, volatility can increase or
    decrease for the same market at different times, depending on conditions.
    Bottom line: Volatility changes and the more volatile markets today could fall
    out of speculative favor tomorrow. For these reasons, our time bar for the short-
    term chart is variable, and we constantly need to monitor the markets we trade
    for indications of volatility changes.
        I’ve developed a general guide to help you determine the correct time
    interval to use for the N#M. This guide is based on the dollar value of the daily
    price range—a direct measure of volatility.


    Time Interval Guide
    If the dollar value of the daily price range per contract is

    ● $500–$749—Use a 45-minute chart.
    ● $750–$999—Use a 30-minute chart.
    ● $1,000–$1,499—Use a 25-minute chart.
    ● $1,500–$1,999—Use a 20-minute chart.
    ● $2,000–$2,999—Use a 15-minute chart.
    ● $3,000–$3,999—Use a 12-minute chart.
    ● More than $4,000—Use a 10-minute chart.

       Determining the proper time interval requires approximately one month’s
    (20–21 trading sessions) price data.

          To determine the interval, average the high and low for each day (this deter-
      mines the range for that day) and then average the ranges for the period. Repeat
      this exercise monthly to determine whether volatility has increased or
      decreased, requiring an adjustment.

    One corn contract is sized at 5,000 bushels. Therefore, every penny-per-bushel
    move has a dollar value of $50 per contract. The average range during this period
    worked out to be 18.6¢, or $930 per contract, per day (18.6¢ × $50 / cent value
    per 5,000 bushels a contract = $930). This number fits into our $750–$999
    category, so we used a 30-minute chart. The average range was fairly consistent
    during the campaign, so we didn’t need to vary this 30-minute time interval.

         This works out to a $5.45 average range, or $5,450 range per contract per
      day
         (545¢ × $10 / cent value per 1,000 barrel contract = $5,450).
         Oil during this time period had an average range of more than $4,000—
      that’s about as volatile as it gets. Therefore, we would use the shortest time
      frame of 10-minute intervals.


      Natural Number Break Points
      How do we determine the break points for the buy and sell signals? For
      example, for corn entry signals, we used the nearest natural numbers (540, 550,
      560, and so on), but for oil we used the nearest master natural numbers (11800,
      11900, 12000, and so on).
          Some common sense is required here. It would be unworkable if we used
      every subsequent natural number for a market with a large daily range because
      it would generate too many signals. In the oil market, natural numbers occur at
      every 10¢ per barrel level—for example 11800, 11810, and 11820. Ten cents
      is the equivalent of a $100-per-contract move for oil, but 10¢ for corn is the
      equivalent of a $500-per-contract move.
          The general rule of thumb is that the break point should be no less than $500
      per contract and no greater than $1,000 per contract. For shorter-term intervals
      (the more volatile markets), we generally would use the $1,000 break points.
      You certainly can modify these risk parameters, but, personally, I don’t want to
      risk more than $1,000 (plus fees and slippage) per contract per trade. Therefore,
      I suggest that you use a maximum $1,000 break point for the most volatile
      markets (shorter time intervals). In the case of oil, this works out to be the
      master natural numbers—those that end in two zeros. Gold, as another example
      at the time of this writing, would use the $1,000 break point (930, 920, 910,
      and so on) and a 15-minute chart (see Charts 9.40 and 9.41).




                                                                             From the Library of Kerri Ross

150   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          Another means of determining a workable break point is to take the average
      range, divide it in half, and use the nearest natural number break point above
      $500 but below $1,000 per contract traded. For example, corn had a $930
      average range per day ($930 / 2 = $465). This is close to $500, so we use 10¢
      breaks. Cocoa, for the 30 days before this writing, had been averaging 120
      points per day ($1,200 per contract / 2 = $600). This is close to $500, so we
      would use 50-point breaks (2700, 2750, 2800, and so on). If cocoa became
      more volatile in the future and averaged 200 points per day ($2,000 per
      contract), we would then use the master natural numbers (2700, 2800, 2900,
      and so on). Another example: The mini-Dow futures at this writing has an
      average range of 200 points. Each point equals $5, so this is a daily dollar range
      of $1,000 per contract divided by 2, or $500. Therefore, we use 100-point
      breaks. If a setup and confirmation for a sell signal in the mini-Dow is at 11530,
      you would place your sell stop at the next-lower master natural number (in this
      case, 11500). If filled, the initial buy stop is placed at 11600 and lowered to
      11500 on a move down to 11400. This formula works for most markets because
      most futures markets are based on tens. However, what about a market such as
      copper, where one point equals $2.50? For copper, the most recent 30-day data
      at this writing indicates a daily range of just below 1,000 points. Because one
      point in copper equals $2.50, this is a $2,500 average range. Half of $2,500 is
      $1,250, and because this is above $1,000, we would use the $1,000 break point.
      For copper, this is 400 points (32500, 32900, and 33300). Therefore, we would
      use the next-closest natural number after the setup and confirmation with 400-
      point breaks. For example, if copper confirmed a buy signal at 34320, entry
      would be on a move up to the next-higher master natural number, or 34400.
      After entry, the initial stop would be 34000, with the first stop raise (to 34400)
      taking place if the market traded up to 34800, then the next stop raise at 35200,
      and so forth.
          I have found this guide to be useful in my own trading; however, feel free to
      vary the intervals to suit your own style of trading. The important point to
      remember is that as volatility speeds up, your time interval shortens.


      Improvements—Should Judgment Ever Be Used?
      To accurately evaluate the methodology statistically, it was necessary to adhere
      to rigid rules. However, with some common sense and good judgment, it’s
      certainly possible to improve our results. Consider these two possible situations
      in which you might have opted to use judgment to either lessen the risk or
      enhance the profit potential on a particular trade.




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    Entering or Exiting Early When Close to the Natural Number
    It’s generally not a good procedure to change the rules in the middle of the game
    to suit your whims. However, a methodology should not be so rigid that it
    avoids the use of common sense. I see nothing wrong with using your gut
    instincts sometimes if it makes sense; just don’t overdo this. Additionally, if you
    enter or exit prematurely to reduce risk or enhance profitability, it’s important
    to remain aware of what number it takes to get back on track.
        For example, Trade 55 was a buy signal at the natural number 540; however,
    by closing at 530 1/4, the program just missed a setup and buy signal at the
    natural number 530 (see Chart 9.42). If the setup had been just one second
    earlier, the buy signal would have legitimately been at the 530 natural number.
    Because other bullish indicators existed at the time (this came after the crop
    report with the key reversal higher, the bullish RSI readings, and our SNI
    flashing a buy signal), it made sense to enter immediately on the setup and not
    wait for the confirmation and buy signal. This action would have resulted in
    nearly a $1,500-per-contract profit versus $1,000.

152   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          On the other hand, Trade 56 was a buy signal at 560 that was eventually
      stopped at 560 for a break-even. However, the market ran as high as 579 during
      the trade. If it had topped just 1¢ higher, at 580, the stop could have then been
      raised to 570, resulting in a $500-per-contract profit instead of the break-even.
      In real-time trading, I elected to raise the stop at the time and take the $500-per-
      contract profit. It didn’t make sense to me to risk 19¢ for, at best, a break-even
      when a 9¢ risk (versus the normal 10¢) resulted in a profit.
          Judgment on particular trades can greatly enhance your bottom-line
      profitability; just be cognizant of the fact that your judgment won’t always be
      right. So if you take the alternate route, you’ll need to be aware at all times
      where the program actually is, to be able to get back on track, if necessary.


         Final Thoughts
      As my deadline time approaches, the December contract still has more than
      three months to run, but another three months of blow-by-blow really isn’t
      necessary; I think you got the idea here. Certainly, I’ll continue to trade corn
      during this period, and my plan is to maintain the profit-and-loss data for the
      entire corn campaign (up until the delivery period at the end of November). If
      you’re interested in learning how the corn campaign performed into the final
      months, I invite you to e-mail me at gkleinman1@mac.com. Additionally, I’m
      interested in hearing about your experiences with N#M and whether you’ve
      modified what I’ve presented in The New Commodity Trading Guide.
          I sincerely hope you’ll be able to use N#M to your benefit, and I wish you a

    Trading Chaos



“It’s a dog-eat-dog world, and I’m wearing Milk-Bone underwear.”
—Norm (from Cheers)

“Chaos is a friend of mine.”
—Bob Dylan

     More than five decades ago, the legendary trader W. D. Gann described a
     market top:
          [Market tops are chaotic] with wild fluctuations, high volume and great
          activity; a feverish public buys madly; people wait for reactions, get
          discouraged, and buy at the market; fortunes are made in paper profits,
          yet less than 10% will ever cash in. The first sign of the end comes with
          a sharp break on no news (possibly at the open). This is the warning.
          Then a second rally may come to approximately the high point and
          could hold for awhile but THE SATURATION POINT IS REACHED;
          THE END IS NEAR; EVERYONE IS LOADED AND WILL BE
          LOOKING FOR A BUYER WHO IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
          Then comes the deluge! At tops, HOPE & FEAR INCREASE TO
          THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL (and most people trade on hope & fear and
          not sound judgment). DO NOT WAIT UNTIL EVERYONE ELSE IS
          SELLING; GET OUT ON THE FIRST DANGER SIGNAL. When
          everyone wants to sell, profits run into losses fast. Profits from a whole
          year can be lost in days! WILD ACTIVE MARKETS ARE BROUGHT




                                                                            From the Library of Kerri Ross

            ABOUT BY FEVERISH MANIPULATION; THEY INCREASE THE
            IMAGINATION AND EXAGGERATE HOPES; THEY TAKE AWAY
            ALL SENSE OF REASON & PROPORTION and you must keep a cool
            head. Remember all things come to an end and a train going 60 mph will
            cause a greater smash up than one going 5—jump before she bumps.
            William D. Gann, How to Make Profits in Commodities (Lambert-Gann
            Publishing, 1951).
          Wild active markets brought about by feverish manipulations, taking away all
      sense of reason and proportion? That sounds similar to electronic trading today
      and just about every day.
          Trading in today’s electronic marketplace is akin to war games, and as Patton
      observed, “The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the
      other bastard die for his.”
          Today’s electronic marketplace has a big problem. (Or is it an opportunity?)
      Critics say that the olden days of the pits added order to the markets. The
      professional market maker standing in the pit would observe the order flow in
      terms of the news, and he or she often took the other side of excessive specu-
      lative order flow. This made for a more orderly market environment. Many
      computer traders don’t look at the news—they’re looking at the trend of the
      market and hop on for the ride. Liquidation works the same way in reverse as
      they scramble out. Stops are hit, generating margin calls and causing more liqui-
      dation as it all feeds on itself. Without the professional market maker, this leads
      to vacuums and overextended moves because fewer players exist to take the
      other side of momentum. When the vacuum is finally filled, the move in the
      opposite direction is just as frenzied. Screen trading moves markets faster and
      takes them farther than the olden days, when the seasoned pit traders would
      step in front of the train.
          Today’s electronic markets are akin to a battlefield. Therefore, heed the
      words of Napoleon Bonaparte: “The battlefield is a scene of constant chaos. The
      winner will be the one who controls that chaos, both his own and the enemy’s.”
          Today volatility is huge. Previously, “news days” were often volatile, but
      now we see volatility almost every day. We get instant fills now—a good thing—
      but in the process, the Internet has created a dog-eat-dog trading world. Get
      used to this because it’s not going away. The good news is that the more extreme
      the moves, the better it is for our trend-following ways. And similar to the days
      of the pits, screen markets are also made by humans, and humans continue to
      respond to the same stimuli (natural numbers being one of them).
          I’ve tried to provide you with some ideas and strategies to help you capture
      your fair share of the profit pool. As an old-time trader once told me, the key to




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

    success in trading is “Slow and steady wins the race.” This requires calmness at
    all times, which is not always easy to obtain, but a systematic approach will help.
    With that said, I can almost guarantee that you’ll stray from your original plan
    sometimes because we’re all human.
         So my parting advice is to be consistent. Have the guts to stick to your plan
    and take your signals. It’s generally not a recipe for success to try to
    overengineer your trading plan or attempt to outguess the market. If the market
    is not going your way, then you must go its way. This is where a trend-following
    approach can help you stay on track.
         Gann told us, “The tape moves in mysterious ways the multitude to deceive.”
    When a market looks the weakest, it might actually be the strongest. It’s
    essential that you use the one human quality Gann considered essential:
    patience—the patience to wait for a bona fide signal before entering a trade, and
    the patience to hold tight.
         It’s equally important that you develop Gann’s second essential quality of
    discipline: the discipline to take all the signals, including those that at first blush
    appear to be dead wrong. You need discipline and patience to stay with the
    winning trades until you have a definitive signal to exit. It’s fun to take a profit,
    but taking premature profits will lead to ultimate failure. The impulse to take
    profits and try to reposition better will often be quite strong. You will see
    numerous times when a market is overdone, and you know you can reenter
    better if you cash in now. When this impulse hits you and you don’t go with it,
    you’ll often regret it. If you stick with your methodology and don’t liquidate,
    you’ll become frustrated if the market did what your gut said it would. Then the
    temptation becomes even greater to gut-trade the system next time. However,
    trust me: This is no recipe for success over the long run. The reason has to do
    with the nature of the big moves. When using a trend-following program, the
    best trades will be those you’ll have the good fortune to be on for the longest
    periods of time. I’d consider our N#M corn campaign a success, but consider
    this: From more than 50 trades, just 6 of these generated more than 80% of the
    profits. Only about 10% of the trades generated 80% of the profits, and if you
    missed just one of these trades, you greatly impacted the bottom line. Before
    taking each signal, it was virtually impossible to know which of the trades would
    be the big money makers. If we could know, we’d make only those trades. But
    we’re often dealing with the unknown. Also remember that, in an accelerating
    market, the most dramatic portion of the move generally takes place at the end.
    This is when your greatest profits accumulate and the temptation grows to book
    them prematurely. But you already know it’s my contention that nobody alive
    is able to consistently pick the actual top or bottom. Discipline and patience, not
    brains or logic, will get you paid.




                                                                                From the Library of Kerri Ross
156   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          How do you acquire these essential qualities of discipline and patience? It
      takes practice. Write down your game plan before trading and then follow it.
      Know every day what needs to happen in the marketplace for you to take an
      action. If no signal occurs, don’t gamble out of boredom—just do nothing. The
      fewer trades you make, the higher your odds for maximum profitability.
          One final caveat: Although I believe N#M works over time and should assist
      you immensely in your trading, don’t take my word for it—you need to
      convince yourself. I’m also not claiming it’s the Holy Grail—just a disciplined,
      businesslike approach to trading the markets. Whether you use it, you’ll need a
      disciplined approach to this chaos called electronic trading. Technical systems
      have the advantage of being objective because they minimize emotions and
      opinions. Traders get wiped out (and it occurs daily) because they have an
      opinion and won’t admit or believe that they’re wrong.
          Finally, I would be pleased to hear from you. If you would like to share your
      experiences with N#M, or any interesting trading experience, for that matter,
      I’m all ears. If you believe you’ve developed an improvement for N#M or you
      would like to run your own program by me, I would like to hear about this as
      well. And if you have an interest in having me manage a trading account on your
      behalf, or if you have other market-related questions, shoot me an e-mail at
      geo@commodity.com, and I will do my best to respond in a timely manner.
          It’s easier paddling downstream than up, it takes less effort walking with the
      wind than into it, and it’s our belief that it’s more profitable trading with the
      trend than against it. It’s difficult to be on the wrong side of a major move when
      you’re on the right side of the trend.

—Lord Keynes


    Much of the appendix content was reproduced from my previous book, Trading
    Commodities and Financial Futures: A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering the
    Markets (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Financial Times, 2004).

       Section 1: A Moving Average Primer
    If a Holy Trading Grail exists, I have not found it—and why would “they”
    (whoever “they” are) share it with you anyway? One of the most important
    lessons I can teach you is this: No single pattern, system, method, or indicator
    works in all market conditions. The best you can hope for is to find a tool that
    will place the odds in your favor. If your winning percentage is favorable, and if
    your average wins are bigger than your average losses, you’ll make money. The
    good news is that excellent technical tools are available that, when used
    properly, can put the odds in your favor.
        An old-timer once told me, “If you can correctly identify the trend, you will
    make money.” How profound. And this makes sense because if you can
    correctly identify the trend, the market will likely move your way. Even if your
    timing is initially off, the trend will often bail you out. One set of technical tools
    has validity for trend determination, and I have personally found them most
    valuable: moving averages. In fact, let’s call the moving average “the most



                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
158   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      valuable technical tool” (TMVTT). I’ve used them successfully in my own
      trading. This section discusses the basics: what they are, how they work, and
      how to use them properly in your own trading.


      Bottom Pickers Versus Trend Followers
      Some traders say they are able to pick tops and bottoms with accuracy, and
      indicators (the RSI, for example) plus various patterns (the “key reversal,”
      “engulfing lines” in candlestick charting) are designed to do just that. No doubt
      the trader who can pick tops and bottoms with any degree of success will make
      the most money; however, I have found that this is a very difficult thing to do
      over time. Anyone who trades long enough might be lucky and catch a major
      top or bottom. I can remember two cases in my career when I’ve been lucky
      enough to catch one (this is over thousands of trades)—one in soybeans and one
      in copper. I’m not talking about a daily high or low, or even a weekly high or
      low, but a major—yearly or even quarterly—top or bottom. I’m talking about
      the contract high or low on the historical charts. Catching one of these is a very
      lucky and almost impossible thing to do because, in hundreds of trading days
      every year, there’s only one major top and only one major bottom. For that
      matter, even minor tops and bottoms (daily or weekly highs and lows) are hard
      to catch because they’re the exception, not the rule. During any period, every
      market has its top and its bottom price, but how many thousands of other trades
      took place even in a fairly short period of time?
          An old trading adage goes something like this: “Bottom pickers get their
      hands slapped.” As W. D. Gann has taught us, no matter how cheap or how
      expensive a market might appear, it’s never too cheap to sell or too high to buy.
      As a result, I have found it much easier, and ultimately more profitable, to take
      a chunk out of the middle of a move. This is what moving averages are designed
      to do. Moving averages are trend-following tools. This means they do not antic-
      ipate the market—they lag it. They are designed to help us determine what the
      current trend is and when the trend has turned; however, they can tell us these
      things only after a trend is in place. By definition, this is after the move is already
      underway. Therefore, it’s impossible to pick tops and bottoms using moving
      averages. Don’t worry about missing the top, the bottom, or a portion of any
      move. Too many traders feel that if they haven’t picked the top or bottom, it’s
      too late to take a trade. This is one of the primary reasons that the majority of
      traders never make any money. Gold might have fallen $100 per ounce during
      a year’s period and already made its low, but after it rallies $20 off the bottom,
      it doesn’t look that cheap to most people anymore. This is because most people
      have short-term memories, and recent history is the history remembered first.




                                                                                  From the Library of Kerri Ross

    The previous $80 down was a tremendous short sale; anyone looking at a chart
    could have determined that. Looking back (and hindsight is always 20/20), so
    what if you missed the first $20 of that move? Or what if you were trying to
    hang on to a long position for the previous $100 down? In that case, I bet you
    wished you had left that top $20 on the table (to save the grief and financial
    devastation the remaining $80 brought).
        Our primary job as traders is to identify the major trend, and if we can do
    this with any degree of accuracy, we will make money. So my advice is to never
    worry about missing the first part of any move. The second part can be very
    profitable, and history has shown that, in most cases, that last part is the most
    profitable. You should also remember that scores of legendary traders, including
    Richard Dennis and Paul Tudor Jones, use trend-following techniques, and they
    have taken hundreds of millions of dollars out of the futures.
        Moving average methodologies have been around for more than a century.
    Richard Donchian is recognized as the modern “father of moving averages.”
    Donchian was with the now-defunct Shearson in the late 1970s. He developed
    specific moving average trading techniques, and for more than 20 years, he
    successfully managed money using them. They were useful then and are just as
    useful now. This is because the markets still tend to move in trends—and, as you
    know already, if we can accurately identify the trend of the market, we will make
    money.


    A Moving Picture
    Any one price is similar to a snapshot in time: It cannot tell us what the trend is.
    It does tell us something, but hardly the whole story. When you take ten photo-
    graphs in rapid succession, you can get a better picture of the whole story. If the
    story is the market, you get a better picture of the true trend by looking at the
    last ten prices, as opposed to looking at just one. When you put together a series
    of 20 blocks of ten photos each, you then have a movie that will be infinitely
    more informative than a photo or two. This movie is analogous to a moving
    average line that you can overlay on a price chart. By observing the direction this
    line is moving and the strength (or velocity) of the move, you can get a sense of
    which faction is stronger at the time—the bulls or the bears. If the bulls are
    stronger than the bears, the moving average line will appear to move up, and the
    current price will trade above the MA, and vice versa. The tough question when
    using TMVTT is how many prices give us the best feel for the trend. If we use
    too many, the old data can tend to put the true trend out of focus. If we use too
    few, we cannot really tell what we’re looking at.




                                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
160   The New Commodity Trading Guide




           Remember that when we utilize any trend-following method, we’re not
      trying to forecast when a market move will start or end. Instead, we are using a
      totally technical approach that relies on a specific type of indicator to tell us
      what the trend is. Then by taking a market position in sync with this trend, we
      are attempting to place the odds in our favor. We also would like to have this
      indicator alert us, with some degree of reliability, when the trend has changed
      before we give back too big a chunk of our paper profits or before any unrealized
      losses become too serious.
           Moving averages can tell you when the trend changes. More important, they
      will keep you on the major portion of a major trend, and this is where the big
      money is made. Still, nothing worthwhile is ever easy. In trendless markets,
      moving average techniques will generate false signals, and some periods will
      have strings of smaller losses. Sometimes strings of smaller losses can add up to
      bigger losses. Be forewarned that drawdown periods will occur, and you must
      be adequately capitalized to ride these out. Finally, when using moving averages,
      it is extremely important for you to never lose your winning qualities of patience
      and discipline—particularly when the bad strings occur. This is the key to
      success.
           Moving averages come in various flavors and sizes. They range from simple,
      to weighted, to smoothed and exponential. Traders use them alone or in combi-
      nations as crossovers—even triple crossovers. They use them in oscillators as
      moving average convergence and divergence and in bands. Our basic underlying
      assumption is that, more often than not, markets move in a trending fashion. I
      should mention that not everyone believes this is a true statement. A contingent
      of academics feel that market movements are random in nature (the “random
      walk theorists”), but I believe you can fairly easily prove to yourself that this
      “random walk” is bunk. Although markets can be random in a short period of
      time, look at any chart of any commodity of at least four to six months in length.
      You’ll see the trends unfold before your eyes. When demand for a particular
      commodity or a financial asset is stronger than supply, prices (and, therefore,
      the market) will move in an uptrend. When supply is overwhelming demand at
      any particular point in time, the market will trend downward.
           It’s easy to determine trends after the fact by looking at a chart. For example
      it’s easy to determine the trends in Chart A.1.




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross

        However, it’s not easy to determine the trends in the thick of the battle. And
    the news (the fundamentals) will not help you because the news is most bullish
    at the top and most bearish at the bottom. Plus, although markets will trend up
    or down, they can also move sideways. An erratic up or down period, a trendless
    market, temporarily wreaks havoc with any trend-following system. You’ll need
    to use your discipline and patience to persevere in these periods. The good news
    is that I have found that markets are in uptrends or downtrends more often, and
    for longer periods of time, than they are in sideways trends. This is why moving
    average methodologies can put the odds in your favor.


    The Simple Moving Average
    The simplest moving average is simple to construct—it’s called (surprise) the
    simple moving average (SMA). The trader can select any number of days or
    periods. The SMA formula follows:
           SMA = (P1 + P2 + P3 + … + PN) / N
           P is the price of the commodity being averaged.
           N is the number of days (or periods) in the moving average.




                                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
162   The New Commodity Trading Guide




          The value of an SMA is determined by the values that are being averaged and
      the time period. For example, a 10-day SMA shows the average price for the
      past 10 days, a 20-day SMA shows the average price for the last 20 days, and so
      on. The time period depends on the trader’s time horizon—it can be years,
      months, weeks, days, minutes, or even ticks. You can calculate moving averages
      based on opens, closes, highs, lows, and even the average of the day’s ranges. I
      recommend using only the close or the settlement price for each day because I
      believe it’s the most important single price of the day—it’s the price used to
      calculate margin calls. If the market closes on the high, or in the high range,
      most of the short players (unless they shorted right at the high[s]) will have
      funds transferred out of their accounts and placed into the long’s accounts. This
      action makes the shorts a bit weaker and the longs a bit stronger (at least for the
      next day).
          Let’s construct a 5-day SMA of crude oil based on the closing prices. Assume
      that the closes during the past five days were 2105, 2110, 2115, 2120, and
      2125. The 5-day SMA is 2115. If the market closes at 2155 on the sixth day, it
      will cause the 5-day SMA to rise to 2125, the average of the last five days divided
      by 5.
            5SMAday1 = (2105 + 2110 + 2115 + 2120 + 2125) / 5 = 2115
            5SMAday2 = (2110 + 2115 + 2120 + 2125 + 2155) / 5 = 2125
          In the formula, you always drop the oldest closing price and add the most
      recent closing price. In this example, when using the 5-day SMA, you always
      drop the sixth-oldest day. With a 10-day SMA, you drop the eleventh-oldest
      day, and so on. The trend direction is determined by the direction the SMA is
      moving and by comparing today’s settlement price with the moving average. In
      this simple example, the trend is up because the close on the most recent day—
      we’ll call this day 2 (2155)—is higher than the SMA (2125). On day 1 (the
      previous day), the close was 2125 and the SMA was 2115, so the trend is up.
      Even with this limited data, the odds suggest that we should play from the long
      side. On day 2, the close was 2155 and the SMA 2125, so the trend is up and
      we stay long. When the closing price turns down and under the average, a sell
      signal is generated.
          You can connect each day’s SMA value on a chart, and this produces a line.
      You can chart this line and overlay it onto a price chart to generate trading
      signals. As long as the line on any particular day is under the closing price, the
      trader would stay long because the SMA has determined that the trend is up.
      After the line crosses over the closing price, the trader would go short because
      the trend has turned down. If long and the line crosses over the closing price,




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross

    the trader would reverse the position by selling double the number of contracts
    owned. The problem is that if you do this every time the line crosses price
    (especially when using shorter-term averages), you can easily get whipsawed
    (bounced back and forth, with small losses plus commissions eating you up). A
    market will often trade in a wild range, moving up and down wildly in the same
    session. But as I have mentioned before, I believe that the closing price is the
    most significant.
        As a simple rule when trading using SMAs, I recommend ignoring intraday
    movements (these often merely create “noise”) and waiting for the close to
    penetrate the SMA to generate a signal. Even better, wait for a “two-day close”
    (two consecutive days of penetration of the MA at the close) to signal a change
    in trend and, therefore, a change in position. However, by waiting for the close,
    you take on additional risk because, in a volatile market or a wide-ranging day,
    the price at the close could be far above or below the MA. For example, if you
    waited for the close on Black Monday 1987 (the day the Dow closed 500 points
    lower than Black Friday), you were in deep water. This is why good money-
    management sense says to always additionally use an ultimate “down-and-out
    point” for any position—a physical stop loss. You should do this when using any
    technical system (or fundamental, for that matter). When using an MA
    technique, place your stop to create an approximate maximum percentage loss
    for those abnormal moves. Abnormal moves, although quite rare, do occur and
    your first rule is to always avoid the catastrophic loss—the one so big that it
    renders us unable to continue trading. Incidentally, option strategies can also
    help here. You can use puts to protect long positions and calls to protect short
    positions. However, most markets are normal. And in normal markets, a general
    rule of thumb for our first simple yet effective trading system is this: On the
    close, if the market price has fallen below the moving average line, a sell signal
    is generated. On the close, if the market price has risen above the moving
    average line, a buy signal is generated.
        You can take the signal at either the close of the signal day or the open of the
    following day. The preferred method is the close of the signal day because it has
    been proven that when a market closes at an extreme of a day’s price range
    (which often creates the signal), it will follow through in the direction of the
    close the following day. Sometimes the violation of the MA could be a close call.
    On those days, I would opt to wait one more day instead of risking taking a false
    signal. However, you need to know on a daily basis exactly where the average
    you are following will be coming into the close, and use a “stop close only”
    order to enter a new position or exit an existing one. Alternatively, you can
    place a market order just before the close.

      How Many Days Should You Use in Your MA?
      The length of the MA greatly impacts trading activity and, therefore,
      profitability. Some traders use 5-day MAs, some use 10-day, others use 20-day,
      many funds use 50- or 100-day, and so on. The length is an arbitrary decision,
      depending on the type of trader, but length directly determines the sensitivity of
      any MA. The length determines how much time an MA has to respond to a
      change in price. It is a matter of “lag time.” This is a simple but important
      concept: Shorter moving averages are more sensitive than longer moving
      averages. A 5-day MA is more sensitive than a 10-day MA, and both of these are
      more sensitive than a 20-day MA. The more sensitive an MA is, the smaller the
      loss will be on a reversal signal; however, there will be a higher likelihood of a
      whipsaw (when a false reversal signal causes a trader to reverse a trade too
      soon). A false signal occurs when a minor movement, which ultimately does not
      change the major trend, is enough to push the MA in the opposite direction of
      the settlement price, resulting in a false position change. It is false simply
      because the trader will subsequently need to reverse once again when the major
      trend reasserts itself. It’s important to use an MA that is long enough so that it
      is not overly sensitive. However, if the MA is too long, the trader will tend to
      take too big a loss (or give up too big a portion of unrealized paper profits)
      before even being aware of a trend change. A longer MA will keep you in a trade
      longer, thereby maximizing paper profits, but it can eat into realized profits
      because it moves too slowly. Similar to the story of the three bears, the MA
      cannot be too hot or too cold; it needs to be “just right.” The most popular
      question I’m asked centers on what is the “right” moving average to use. We
      discuss the “right” moving average to use (in my opinion) in greater length, but
      the bottom line is this: “Just right” is not always that easy to determine and will
      change with market conditions. Voluminous studies have been done to
      determine which length is right for which specific market, but I believe that
      these are useless because market conditions change for all markets. The silver
      market of the Hunt era is not the same silver market of today. Soybeans in a
      drought market act far differently than in a normal weather market.


      Disadvantages of the SMA
      The majority of traders who use moving averages use SMAs because they are
      simple. They are easy to calculate, but I don’t always recommend them because
      the oldest price has the same influence as the newest. Generally, the newest price
      reflects current market conditions better than the oldest; however, the SMA
      weights them equally. For example, suppose wheat is trading between 490 and




                                                                               From the Library of Kerri Ross
A   A Moving Average Primer, an Open Interest Primer, and the Advanced Open Interest Course                  165




    510, and the simple 9-day SMA is about 500. However, the price was 475 on
    one day of data. When this low number becomes ten days old and is dropped,
    the SMA jumps. This could generate a buy signal indicating a new major
    uptrend; however, the market tone might not have changed. In other words,
    when one old piece of oddball data gets dropped, it has a tendency to jump the
    SMA, which can often result in an overstatement.


    Alternatives to the SMA
    Remember that you can think of any one price as a snapshot in time. It tells you
    something about price, but it hardly tells the whole story. Ten photos in rapid
    succession provides you with a better picture of the story, and 20 blocks of ten
    photos each paints an even better picture. If you are looking at a movie
    composed of 200 snapshots, the last 20 will most likely tell you more about
    what’s probably coming next than the first 20. This is where exponential and
    weighted moving averages come in. They place more weight on the newest
    prices, and this can be more valid than the older prices when determining the
    true trend.


    Exponential and Weighted Moving Averages (EMA and WMA)
    The exponential and weighted moving averages assign a greater weight to more
    recent events. The WMA increases the importance of the most recent price by a
    factor equal to the period used. For example, with a 5-day weighted average, the
    fifth day is given a factor five times greater than the first. To calculate a 5-day
    weighted average, multiply day 5 (the most current day) by 5, day 4 by 4, day 3
    by 3, day 2 by 2, and the first, or oldest, day by 1 and then divide by 15. The
    EMA also weights recent events more than distant events, but it smoothes out
    the average for a more consistent result. The smoothing factor (SF) is deter-
    mined by dividing 2 into the moving average plus 1 of the SMA you want to
    weight and smooth. For example, if you want to smooth a 5-day SMA, you
    divide 2 by 6. The result, .33, is the smoothing factor. For a 10-day SMA, the
    SF is 2 ÷ 11 = .18. For a 20-day SMA, the SF is 2 ÷ 21 = .096. The SF is a
    fixed weight applied to the current price, with the balance applied to the most
    recent moving average value itself. Let’s look at a specific example to make this
    clearer. Let’s calculate a 5-day SMA and a 5-day EMA for wheat. Remember, we
    need at least 5 days of data to produce our starting point for the SMA. Suppose
    the closing (settlement) prices for 11 consecutive days of wheat prices are as
    follows:




                                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross

         We can easily see in hindsight from this data that the trend was up during this
      11-day period (the market gained 41¢). However, hindsight is always 20/20,
      and it’s not always easy to know just what the trend actually is when we’re in
      the thick of the battle. This is where moving averages can help.
         The SMA is calculated as follows:

        If you used the 5-day SMA to generate buy or sell signals, starting on day 5,
    you would have been a buyer at the closing price of 463 (because the price was
    above the SMA). You would have remained long on days 6, 7, and 8. But on day
    9, the price fell below the SMA, and you would have sold and reversed (gone
    short) at the closing price of 464. The result would have produced a marginal
    trade. Now you’re short at 464 and would have to reverse again on day 10 at
    476 for a 12¢ loss. This is a classic whipsaw. You got jerked out of what was a
    good trade in a definite uptrend when one low-ball price (the oldest) is dropped
    out of the equation.
        Now let’s look at how the 5-day EMA performed during the same time
    period. To calculate the smoothing factor for the 5-day, you divide 2 by 6. Six
    is used because it is 1 more than 5. Two divided by 6 = .33. You multiply this
    smoothing factor of .33 by today’s price and add this to 1 minus the smoothing
    factor, which is .67, times the EMA.

        The results show that the price remained above the EMA during the entire
    period, even day 9. Therefore, no whipsaw resulted. The trader would remain
    long from 446 and still be long on day 11 at 481. Yes, you can still get
    whipsawed using the EMA in a choppy market, but in general, I’ve found that
    WMAs and EMAs are superior moving averages, with fewer whipsaws.
        Many traders are using moving average systems with a percentage band (such
    as the Bollinger bands) that uses an exponentially smoothed moving average
    plus a band above this EMA and minus a band below the EMA by the same




                                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
168   The New Commodity Trading Guide




      percentage. A signal occurs whenever the closing price breaks outside the band.
      Exit occurs when the price recrosses into the band. Some traders like to trade
      within the bands, which is more like top and bottom picking. They sell at the
      top band and buy at the bottom. The risk point is set at some percentage outside
      of the band. I believe this method has some validity. But because I personally
      find it difficult to pick tops and bottoms (I’m a trend follower), I leave this to
      those who are inclined to attempt top and bottom picking.
          Also, although it’s nice to understand how the moving average is derived,
      don’t stress about the calculations. Almost all the trading software programs on
      the market today automatically calculate the SMA, WMA, and EMA. If you have
      access to real-time quotes, the software calculates these averages in real time,
      based on the last tick, the last bar, the average of a bar, or the close of a bar.


      Summary
      Moving averages are not the Holy Grail and are not all created equal; however,
      if used systematically and consistently, they tend to keep a trader on the right
      side of the big moves. They are a totally technical approach (they rely on price
      only), and it doesn’t matter which market you use them on. They work well in
      bull and bear markets and in both the stock and commodity markets; however,
      they’ll whipsaw the trader in a sideways or trendless market. However, this isn’t
      as big of a disadvantage as it might appear at first, because my experience has
      shown that markets will spend more time in trending modes than trendless
      modes. But periods with choppy, whipsaw-type markets have lasted for many
      weeks. Sometimes a seasoned trader can sense that a market is trendless (the
      time to step to the sidelines) but not always. And if not properly capitalized or
      disciplined during these periods, a trader can be wiped out or, at the very least,
      become demoralized and abandon a moving average program. Usually the
      trader will quit just before the big move starts. Remember that you need to catch
      the big moves when using a moving average system or you won’t win.

         Section 2: Open Interest
      Open interest (OI) analysis is a powerful trading tool that futures traders use.
      (Stock traders do not have it.)


      The Open Interest Primer
      OI is simply the number of contracts outstanding, the total number held by
      buyers or (not and) sold short by sellers on any given day. The OI number gives




                                                                              From the Library of Kerri Ross
A   A Moving Average Primer, an Open Interest Primer, and the Advanced Open Interest Course                  169




    you the total number of longs and the total number of shorts because, unlike in
    stocks, in futures, the short interest is always equal to the long interest. Each
    long is willing to either accept delivery of a particular commodity or offset a
    contract(s) sometime before the expiration date. Each short is willing to either
    make delivery or offset a contract(s) before the expiration date. With this in
    mind, you can plainly see that OI is a measurement of the willingness of longs
    and shorts to maintain their opposing positions in the marketplace. It is a quanti-
    tative measurement of this difference of opinion.
        OI numbers go up or down based on how many new traders are entering the
    market and how many old traders are leaving. OI goes up by one when one new
    buyer and one new seller enter the market. This act creates one new contract. OI
    goes down by one when a trader who is long closes out one contract with
    someone who is already short. Because this contract is now closed out, it disap-
    pears from the OI statistics. If a new buyer buys from an old buyer (who is
    selling out), total OI remains unchanged. If a new seller buys back or covers from
    a new seller entering the market, OI also does not change. The old bear had to
    buy to cover, with the other side of this transaction being a sell by the new bear.
        Let’s look at a typical example. If heating oil has a total OI of 50,000
    contracts, and the next day it rises to 50,100, this means 100 new contracts were
    created by 100 new buyers and 100 new sellers—or perhaps ten new net buyers
    and sellers of ten contracts each, or whatever it takes net to create the new 100.
    During that day, many people closed out and many entered, but the net result
    was the creation of new OI. The market has 50,100 contracts’ worth of shorts
    and 50,100 contracts’ worth of longs at the end of the day. Theoretically, one
    short who had 100 new contracts sold (probably the smart money) could have
    taken the opposing side of 100 others who each bought one (the majority,
    probably the dumb money), but the short and long interest are always the same
    on any particular day.
        The exchanges release OI figures daily, but they are always for the previous
    day, so they are a day old. A trader can chart OI on a price chart, and the
    direction it is changing can tell you some interesting things.


    The Advanced OI Course
    OI statistics are a valuable tool that you can use to predict price trends and
    reversals. The size of the OI reflects the intensity of participants’ willingness to
    hold positions. Whenever prices move, someone wins and someone loses—the
    zero sum game. This is important to remember because when you think about

    which way the market is moving at the time. An increase in OI shows a

      willingness on the part of the participants to enlarge their commitments. Let’s
      say the market is moving lower and OI is increasing. You can assume that some
      of the hurt longs have left the party, but they are being replaced by new longs,
      and many existing longs are still there. If they were liquidating en masse, OI
      would drop. Likewise, if the short holders were primarily taking profits and
      leaving the party, OI would also drop. However, because the OI is increasing
      and the price is dropping, you can assume that the bulls are losing money, but
      many must be hanging in there, or they are recruiting buddies at an increasing
      rate. What are the ramifications of an OI decline? It is a sign that the losers are
      in a liquidation phase (it doesn’t matter which way the market is moving), the
      winners are cashing in, and new players are not entering in sufficient numbers
      to replace them.


      Six Profit Rules for Analyzing OI
      1. If prices are in an uptrend and OI is rising, this is a bullish sign. The bulls
         are in charge. They are adding to positions and making the money, thus
         becoming more powerful. Shorts are also being stopped out, but new
         sellers are taking their place. As the market continues to rise, the longs get
         stronger and the shorts get weaker.
      2. If prices are in a downtrend and OI is rising, this is a bearish sign. The bears
         are in charge in this case. They are adding to their positions, and they are
         the ones making the money. Weaker longs are being stopped out, but new
         buyers are taking their place. As the market continues to fall, the shorts get
         stronger and the longs get weaker. Another way to look at the first two
         rules is that, as long as the OI is increasing in a major trend, it will have the
         necessary financing to draw upon and prosper.
      3. If prices are in an uptrend and OI is falling, this is a bearish sign. The old
         longs, the smart money (I call them “smart money” because they have been
         right to this point), are taking profits and liquidating. They are replaced by
         some new buyers who will not be as strong on balance, but the declining
         OI is an indication that the weak shorts are also bailing. They will be
         replaced to some extent by new shorts that are stronger than the old shorts
         were.




                                                                                From the Library of Kerri Ross
A   A Moving Average Primer, an Open Interest Primer, and the Advanced Open Interest Course                  171




    4. If prices are in a downtrend and OI is falling, this is a bullish sign—the
       mirror image of Rule 3. The smart money, the shorts, are covering or
       liquidating. They will be replaced to a degree by new shorts that are not as
       strong as they were, but the declining OI indicates that the weakened longs
       are largely throwing in the towel. They will be replaced by fresh longs that
       were not as weakened by the lower prices. Another way to look at Rules 3
       and 4 is that when the pool of losers is depleted, the party will be over.
    5. If prices are in a congestion range and OI is rising, this is a bearish sign. The
       reason is that the public generally plays the long side. Rising OI in a
       trading range affair assumes that the commercials and professionals are
       taking the short side, and the uniformed public will most likely lose out in
       the end.
    6. If prices are in a congestion range and OI is falling, this is a bullish sign.
       The reason is that the professionals, who are more likely to be short, are
       covering. The weak hands are throwing in the towel.
