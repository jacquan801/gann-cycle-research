Introduction

W.D. Gann believed that the angular relationships of the planets produced both cycles
and prices and as these cycles/prices could be predicted out into the future because of
the planets perfect mathematical relationship.

At any time astrology is considered sceptically by most people so its not surprising that
Gann didn’t advertise the fact that astrology was his main forecasting tool

In this book I have taken his predictions and where ever possible complete sequences
of trades so that I could find the pattern that would reveal the secret of his method.

There are a lot of books written that claim that they know Ganns method. I think that
there are a lot of Gann like methods but I doubt if the were the ones he used. This is
why I decided to do an investigation based solely on what I could judge was factual eg
his personal charts and his public predictions and trades.

W.D. Gans career spanned 53 years from 1902 until 1955 and during this time he
developed many techniques but when you read The Ticker interview it is obvious that
his trading technique was already developed by 1909 and so this means that we can
forget about any further methods that he used afterwards such as the master time
overlays etc.In this book we are only interested in the things we know he

used. Astrology is the beginning of everything as you will see by the analysis of his
amazing wheat prediction of 1909 and the link between his greatest discovery made on
‘August the 8th 1908 and the Lambert Gann emblem.

In this book you will see the same pattern revealed over and over again so there can be
‘no doubt that this was his method.

While you are reading it may be difficult initially if you have never looked at
astrology,not because of the concepts but because of the terminology and the planets
glyphs I have used the full name for everything instead of the shorthand where ever I
can because I want you to understand and recognise the pattern as quickly as you can,
Remember Gann often mentioned the circle (cycle) the square and the triangle soon
‘you will find out what he meant.

‘Also the moon plays a large part in the timing of events which is one of the points that
he was making in Tunnel thru the air.

It is always hard learning a new language for the first time be it music or chart
reading, The good thing from our point of view is that we are not concerned with any
astrological symbolism only the position of the planets as viewed from earth
(geocentric) You will need to refer to the glossary at the back but we are using three
terms mainly, the trine (triangle-120 degrees conjunct meaning joined together and
square meaning at a 90 degree angle.

This * is used in place of the degree sign eg there are 360* in a circle.

 


 

W.D.Gann and Astrology - The Proof.

To prove to you that Gann really did use the positions of the planets
I thought it would be interesting to take a look at Ganns actual price chart for May
Soybeans from the years 1948-1949 and see what techniques we could see him using
on the chart.

Top left is the astological symbol for the planet Jupiter just at the begining of a Jupiter
trendline(1) He started this trendline on the 4th of October 1948 when Jupiter was at
22 degrees Sagittarius. 22 degrees Sagittarius is also 262 degrees of the 360 degree
circle.Ganns first price marking was at 262 cents and then he started moving his
trendline up by 1 cent every time Jupiter moved by 1 degree.

The next interesting chart marking (2) is a line drawn along at 270 cents marking the
price/degree where Jupiter would change signs from Sagittarius to Capricom.A planet
signs of the zodiac is known as ingress and this chart shows several planets

day of the Mars
crossing.

Each zodiac sign is 30 degrees of the circle. (360 degrees divided by 12 signs = 30
degrees) Gann marked 270 price for Jupiters ingress and then marked 15 cents below
this (5) as well 30 cents lower (6) all potential price targets.

Another interesting trendline is created by the movement of the planet Mars (7) Mars
moves faster than Jupiter and this is reflected in the steeper slope of the Mars trendline,
‘hore aes few light mang that ar aod to ss ina epithets Wt oaEaT
them (9) is a little arrow pointing down when the moons nodes changed to 29 degrees
ofa new sign. This is like a planetary ingress because the moons nodes run counter
clockwise.

It is always fascinating to study this chart but planetary ingress was only a minor part
of Ganns techniques, more important are the actual predictions that Gann made in his
annual forecasts.

August 15th 1902 Gann makes his first trade.

Here are the first elements of the Gann formula,

1A Trine.

2) A Conjunction involving the Trine

3) Balanced aspects. That means the aspects aren't exact but each aspect is not exact by the same

ammount In this case the Sun is trine Uranus with a4 * separation the Sun is also Conjunct.

The clues Gann left are numerous but the most important are the triangle and the square.Have a
look at the emblem for the Lambert Gann publishing company and compare this with the chart for
August the 8th 1908.

‘This is the date that W.D.Gann says that he made one of his greatest discoveries

for predicting the trend of stocks and commoditis.The similarities are obvious.

Another way and more usual way for us to look at the chart from 8th August is as a Tee Square
between Satum Neptune and Uranus and trine between Satur and Mars/Iupiter/Sun,

Notice once again we have, \

1) A Trine, (Sobaen Tene Cn)

2) A Conjunction involving the Trine.

3) One Planet involved in both a trie and a square at the same time.
4) Balanced aspects. That means the aspects aren't exact but each aspect is not exact by the same
ammount Saturggquare Neptune 5*, Satur trine Sun 5*.

....In order to substantiate Mr.Gann’s claims as to what he has been able to do under this method
we called upon Mr. William E. Gilley an Inspector of imports, 16 Beaver Street, New York.
Mr.Gilley is well-known in the downtown district. He himself has studied stock market
movements for twenty-five years during which time he has examined every piece of market
literature that has been issued and procurable in Wall Street. It was he who encouraged Mr.Gann
to study out the scientific and mathematical possibilities of the subject. When asked what had been
‘the most impressive of Mr. Gann’s work and predicitons he replied as follows:

“Mr.Gann’s calculations are based on natural law. I have followed his work closely for years. I
know that he has a firm grasp of the basic principles which govern stock market movements, and J
do not believe any other man on earth can duplicate the idea ‘or his method at the present time.

“Early this year he figures that the top of the advance would fall on a certain day in August and
calculated the prices at which the Dow-Jones averages would then stand. The market culminated
on the exact day and within four-tenths of one percent of the figures predicted.”

You and Mr.Gann must have cleaned up considerable money on all these operations was
suggested.

“Yes, we have made a great deal of money: He has taken half.a million dollars out of the market
in the past few years. I once saw him take $130 and in less than one month run it up to over
$12,000. He can compound money faster than any man I ever met.”

So much for what Mr.Gann has said and done as evidenced by himself and others. Now as to
what demonstrations have-taken place before our representative:

During the month of October, 1909, in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann made, in the presence
of our representative two hundred and eighty-six transactions in various stocks on both the long
and short side of the market. Two hundred and sixty-four of these transactions resulted in profits;
twenty-two in losses.

The capital with he operated was doubled ten times so that at the end of the month he has one
thousand per cent on his original margin.

In our presence Mr.Gann sold Steel common short at 94-7/8 saying that it would not got to 95.
It did not.

On a drive which occurred during the week ending October 29 Mr.Gann bought Steel common at
86 1/4 saying that it would not go to 86. The lowest it sold was 86-1/8,

‘We have seen him give in one day sixteen successive orders in the same stock eight of which
tumed out to be at either the top or the bottom eight of that particular swing. The above we can
positively verify.

‘Such performances as these coupled with the foregoing are probably unparalleled in the history of
the Street.

Over the following pages you will learn how Gann made his predictions.

q


 

Wheat September 30th 1909.

‘This is probably one of Ganns most famous and most puzzling trades because it is
mentioned in The Ticker interview and no-one has been able to rationally solve it until
now.

“One of the most astonishing calculations made by Mr.Gann was during last summer
(1909) when he predicted that September wheat would sell at $1.20. This meant that it
must touch that figure before the end of the month of September. At twelve o’clock
Chicago time, on September 30th (the last day) the option was selling below $1.08,
and it looked as though his prediction would not be fulfilled. Mr.Gann said “If't does
not touch $1.20 by the close of the market it will prove that there is something wrong
with my whole method of calculation. I do not care what the price is now, it must go
there.” It is common history that September wheat surprised the whole country by
selling at $1.20 and no higher in the very last hour of the trading closing at that

figure.’
one that we are interested in first is the trine. (Venus
trine Ne fom the trine conjunctions,squares or oppositions that can be

   
 
  

linked to the trine, ‘Saturn conj ‘Moon and opposite Uranus.
‘So here ‘a powerful Tee square that is activated by the faster moving pl

  
  

    

 

a trine to both a square and an Opposition.

Later you will learn in detail about price targets on the hexagon chart but the last low
on September wheat was 96.5 which is a straight line target to120(360*)

and $1.20 was Gans forecast price for this day when powerful astro aspects were at
work.

The hexagram is the symbol of the planets in occult literature and is the most
important Gann tool for forecasting prices.

planets that are involved in the first part of the move (in this case the high) will also be invotved in
the low.

‘When Cotton made its high on September 8 1952 the trine was Jupiter/Sun with Jupiter conjunet

THE MORNING TELEGRAPH
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1922
GANN FORETOLD RUN OF STOCKS

‘Wall street Scientist Forecasted Top of Bull Market Year in Advance.
HIS INDICATIONS UNCANNY .
By ARTHUR ANGY (financial Editor, The North Side Nesw)

W.D.Gann has scored another astounding hit in his 1922 stock forecast issued in December 1921
That forecast called for first top of the bull wave in April, second top in August, and the final top
and culmination of the bull market October 8 to 15, and strange as it may seem, the average prices
of twenty industrial stocks reached the highest point on October 14 and declined 10 points in
thirty days after that date.

Mr.Gann predicted a big decline for the month of November. He said in the 1922 forecast:
“November 10-14 panicky break.” During this period stocks suffered a severe decline, many
falling 10 points or more in four days and on November 14 lowest average prices were made with
1,500,000 shares traded in on the New York Stock Exchange.

I found his 1921 forecast so remarkable that I secured a copy of his 1922 stocks forecast in order
to prove his claims for myself. And now, at the closing of the current year of 1922, itis but justice
to say I am more than amazed by the result of Mr. Gann’s remarkable predictions based on pure
science and mathematical calculations.

The North Side News stands for a clean Wall Street and has rendered a great public service in
helping to rid Wall Street of the bucket shop evil by publishing a series of articles in conjunction
with the Magazine of Wall Street. We believe in branding a fake, and we believe in giving credit
where due.

GANN NO TIPSTER

Mr. Gann is no “Wall Street tipster.” sending out market letters and so-called “inside
information.” Mr. Gann’s results are obtained by profound study of supply and demand, a
‘mathematical chart of money, business and commodities. He determines when certain cycles are
due, and the order and the time when market movements will follow.

During the past thirty years many men have proclaimed discoveries and theories to “beat the Wall
Street game .” most of which resulted in loss to their followers. They could always tell by the
chart just why the market did it after it happened. Mr.Gann’s theory differs from the others in that
he tells months in advance what stocks are going to do.

Hiis forecast stated that some stocks would make high this year in April, some in August and
others in October- the months when he predicted the bull movement would culminate. Of a list of
a hundred stocks; thirty made highest prices in April and many declined, while others continued
higher; twenty made high during August, and fifty made high of the year in October, from which
the largest decline of the year has taken place.

27 - a


His 1922 forecast indicated final tops on railroad stocks for August 14. The Dow Jones's
averages on rail made high August 21 and reached the same average levels on September 11 and
October 16, but did not exceed the high made in August, which was made seven days later than
the exact date called for in the forecast.

HIS CHART A FACT

Such accurate long range forecasting as Mr.Gann is doing sounds almost unbelievable, and how
he does it I do not know, but the writer does know that he does it. My attention was first called to
his 1921 forecast in which he predicted that stocks would be bottom in August, 1921, and
advance to December, 1921. They did so. His chart or graph of the market one year in advance is
a fact, and that the course of the stock market follows it astoundingly close is equally a fact.

Mr.Gann says the trouble with most chart makers is that they work with only one factor-space
movements or charts that record one to two points up or down-whereas there are three or more
factors to be considered, space, volume and time The most vital is time, and back of that is the
cause of recurrence of high or low prices a certain intervals.

asked Mr.Gann: “What is the cause behind the time factor?”

 

He smiled and said: “It has taken me twenty years of exhaustive study to learn the cause that
produces effects according to time. That is my secret and too valuable to be spread broadcast.
Besides, the public is not yet ready for it.”

 

“Water seeks its level.”continued Mr.Gann. “You can force it higher with a pump, but when you
stop pumping it requires no force to cause it to return to its former level. Stocks are the same.
They can be forced above their natural level of values to where lambs lose all fear, become
charged with hope and buy at the top. Then stocks are permitted to sink to a level where hope
gives way to despair and the most rampant bull becomes a bear and sells out with a loss. My
discovery of the time factor enables me to tell in advance when these extremes must, by the law of
supply and demand, occur in stocks and commodities.”

The hexagon chart.
Price and planetary activity at the same point

The hexagram in Occult tradition is the | of the planets. Ganns hexagon chart is

also one of the most important for getting planetary price targets.

‘You will notice on Ganns may soybean chart how fast the Mars trendline is when
converted straight from longitude degree to price. The hexagon is used to slow the
Sea ine down, This is done "by using the numbers on the hexagon chart as they relate
to price eg the numbers on the chart 90 to 91 are covered by the degrees 0 through to

ZL

Tt is always important when working on price targets to check the hexagon chart as

well as just doing straight longitude conversion.

Here are two examples on the S+P where turns triggered by planetary aspects were
related by price on the hexagon chart.) Anyhoo A 28, dkyuts Crertres

At the major S+P low of 444 Jupiter/Pluto were also conjunct at a price of 444 (28*
‘Scorpio)on the hexagon chart. Jupiter/Pluto were (0*of orb) on November 25th 1994.

The October 1997 hij ‘when Pluto/Mars were conjunct .The act

jigh was 3 days later when price reached the same degree where Pluto/Mars were
conjunct.Prices then fell to low of 844 on the 28th October in a move that was
described later as a mini crash.
The next major top on 20th July 1998 involved Jupiter.

Jupiter was 180* from 1199 on the hexagon chart when it formed a SunSupiter tine

The hexagon and 1908.

The first thing that struck me about the date Gann made his greatest discovery for
finding the trend of stocks and commodities were the numbers themselves.

08((19) 08.
I won't Bore you with the details of how but this is what I eventually discovered is an
additional property of the hexagon.Support and resistance are calculated by counting
the first number (The high or low) as one and counting eight places.

This does not always calculate his target prices but as you have already learnt there are

ther methods to be used depending on the Astrology of the moment. This system
does calculate every price target in Ganns 1954 coffee trades so I believe that it is
-valid.I have seen it working repeatedly in todays market. Here follows some of Gans
price predictions plus some modern market examples and then the astrology of the
‘complete sequence of Ganns coffee trades.

“He came to me when United States Steel was selling around 50 and said ‘This Steel
will run up to 58 but it will not sell at 59. From there it should break 16 3/4 points.”
We sold it short around 58 3/4 with a stop at 59. The highest it went was 58 3/4. From
there it declined to 41 1/4 -17 1/2 points.

Jupiter Ingress. 4

70 Use “SGARE oF pine”
May Soybean High at 276 \ lo

r Gann worked on the basis that Planetary Ingress was a potential trigger for trend _—
change.

Looking at the May bean chart again your first thought would be that 270 (the ingress
= longitude of Jupiter converted to price 270* =270 cents.) would be the exact price

    
 

 

level. Gann: epson quare of 9 chart had ed.on it this being 360 or zero
degrees on th »
[Nowe his sua Thine for may beans starts at 44 cents this being the lowest recorded||
iprice in the contracts history.

‘o-properly use a square oF nine chart (Pree) thet doesn't start at one YOu need to
the time square of nine which starts at one. When you superimpose one square on top
‘of the other you will get proper squaring,
Looking at our may ‘eat sgpaTS TRI superimposed on the time square of nine 40
days from the low is exactly opposite 276 the high. Also ae
range from the low of 2(40). In February 1998 I copied this method with the slight
variation in that I also used the 1908 target method. Either way it worked.
| ‘The steps

1. convert Jupiter ingress into Longitude degrees to an approximate price area
where soybeans are trading.

 

2. use may soybeans price square of nine and then superimpose the time-
square of nine to fine tune your target.

This is how Gann would have worked it out Jupiter is about to change signs and so
this would be the time for a change of trend so on day 40 time is opposite price.275 is
opposite the 238 low and time and price is at aspect 180* or 90* square.

I tT did.On Fel jupiter changed signs and was at zero degrees
ee a pe of revere found things sual don get moving we
planet cl 3 ‘Of a new sign but from Febuary 4th I monitored the time
‘square of 9 and fhe price square to see when they were square and then I sold a break
of that days range.

The 1908 target from the 662 low was 694 1/2. Using the square of nine on day 20 the /
closest price that was square was 695.The actual high was 697.

(Gann never counted the first day of a high or a low saying that they belonged as the

test diy OF previous price wing.)

‘This method can be used on all grains when Jupiter is changing signs. Gann marked his
chart off in 15 cent target bands this being half of each signs range of 30 degrees.
Which price divisions of the 360* circle you use is dependent on the commodities

volitlity.

st.


3
A

oe

For something like oats 15 cents is fine but with soybeans 90* (1/4 of 360*) is usual
(price 840+90*=930 etc) when soybeans are at low price levels or trading quietly 45*

is good eg.500 545 590 ete.

The markings on the following charts are the price/longitude where Jupiter changed
Signs and they were projected out for the whole year. Where 2 lines are closer together

‘it is Bécause Jupiter is just about to change sign.
