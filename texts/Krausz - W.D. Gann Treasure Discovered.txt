THe Reat Story
Who was the greatest market researcher of all time?

Before you answer, consider this’ Do you know anyone who has researched in depth the
following price bar patterns, astronomy, multiple time frame relationships, swing chart
trend definitions. support and resistance zones based on angles? Have you met any
traders that have investigated numerology, ancient and modern geometry, mathematical
refationships of numbers, squaring time and price? Or Western and Hindu astrology,
pyramid technology. and the possible ties to the markets? Do you know of anyone doing
this degree of research, and without a computer?

Such a trader was WD. Gann

W D Gann was an enigma Much has been written about Gann's success, or lack of it.
Questions stil remain as to how great his techniques were, or how poor. Did he make
fortunes or lose them? And more importantly, can any of his concepts stand up in today's
fast moving computer driven markets?

Did you know that back in the 1950's he charged some $5,000 for his courses? At that
tine, that was the price of an average three bedroom house in the USA. Today, the
equivalent cost would be over $50,000. So, back then you had to be pretty serious about
trading to pay that amount of money. And yet, wouldn't that price be worth it if the
techniques were genuine?

The answer to this question lies within each trader's perception of value. Some traders
consider $39 95 too high of a price for a book describing a trading technique. To others,
valid market knowledge is priceless.

THe Roap Axeap

| will show you what I consider to be valid market knowledge, based on W. D. Gann's
Original work. And what do | mean by valid market knowledge? The knowledge is a set of
fixed rules to trade by. You will see that the rules are valid because they meet a number of
requirements; conditions that my twenty years of trading have taught me are important.
Before | discuss this plan, though, | want to share with you the story of how | came into
Possession of this technical concept of swing trading.

W. D. Gann has published a number of books, unfortunately, the majority of the time Gann
wrote in the manner of the ancient mystics; hiding the real meaning behind the surface
€xplanation. Having read his books many times, | found his directions to be vague and
convoluted. And not just me, others, both his followers as well as his detractors have tried
to explain hts concepts in an understandable and usable way Nevertheless, very few
authors have succeeded. And as | said, it is Gann’s own fault A small example of the
challenge is his overuse of the word “square”: squaring time and price: the square of nine:
the square of 24; and on the square. Fortunately. while his books were obscure, his actual
trading courses are more direct and straight to the point.

Some ten years ago, | put out the word here and in Europe that | was interested in
purchasing original W.D. Gann material, especially his courses. You cannot believe the nuts
that fell to the ground, from con-men to dreamers! All traits led to nowhere until a few
months ago when the universe rewarded my persistence. right on my doorstep

Some of you may know that Joe Rondinone was the last trader taught by Gann before he
passed away to the “great trading room in the sky.” You can imagine my astonishment
when Rondinone asked me if | was interested in some original Gann courses that he
bought from Gann back in 1955

Rondinone explained that the courses were typed on WD Gann s letterhead, not in the
usual punted format Also. they were signed and dated by Gannin tis purple ink All five
courses were in thei orginal binding After much haggling we settled on the pace of $1 00
(yes, you read that correctly. one dollar)

Mr. Rondinone’s motives were clear, stating | want these mantcenpts inthe Hands of a
trader and researcher who appreciates ther real value and willuse them Frankly bwas
amazed at my good fortune and Joe's generosity The entire treasure trove consisted of
five courses and two unfinished pages, dated Apnl 18.1955 and headed Time Penods on
the Master 7 Day Pernod for Soybeans” Obvieusly these were a work in progress, as Gann
passed away soon after that date

One method though. caught my eye It was the Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator for
Trading Grains” and it shouted to be studied first Given my personal approach to trading.
this method was given prionty, and the results of that exarmnation are what you will find in
the following chapters Betore we continue the story. | want you to understand the
importance of having a trading plan

Trapinc PLAans

After 20 years ol trading. | find it almost impossible to trade without a plan that does not
have fixed rules Why? Why not just keep up to date with all the news, and trade as you
see fit? Because. if you do not have a set of fixed rules. you cannot do a back test Without
a back test how do you know if your plan worked in the past? Yes. | know that ust because

the plan produces positive results in the past, this does not guarantee success in the future.
But | do guarantee that if the plan does not produce positive mathematical expectations
during the back test then it will never work in the future.

Let me ask you: Would you consider building a house without an architectural plan? Of
course not! No plan would lead to chaos. The same thing applies to trading. So what
constitutes a good trading plan? A valid trading plan must have some minimum
components to earn the right to be called valid.

At the simplest level, a plan must define:
* Market direction (the general direction of the market; for example, the overall trend.)
¢ Tradable trend (the trade direction, in other words; the immediate swing.)
« Support and resistance points (exact zones.)
¢ Action points (entry-exit-pyramid rules.)
* Money management techniques. These should include at least:
A) Capital required for your plan.
B) Stop and Stop/Reversal rutes
C) Profit protection rules.
D) Percentage of capital per trade. (This varies according to the plan.)

With a trading plan that fits this description, you may be ready to trade. Now, back to my
story of W D's “mechanical method " Slowly, |! worked my way through the well worn
pages. making notes as | went along Can you imagine my surprise when | came to his
pages 11 and 12 (reproduced here on pages 5 and 6) and saw that Gann had altered some
of his original calculations and signed these alterations in his usual purple ink?

These alterations were fitted in between the paragraphs. Although the original course is
dated June 1933, the actual alterations were handwritten in early 1955. So | can presume
that Gann thought it was important enough to insert and sign it before he sent the course to
Mr. Rondinone And what did Gann write? Very simply: “Use 2 day charts and rules better
than 3 day. Signed W. D. Gann."

Does Mr Gann changing a three day swing definition to a two day swing definition make it
into a treasure? | could only come to a conclusion by doing a comparative back test on
today’s hyper markets using both daily charts and intra-day time periods, and that ts exactly
what I did!

Charting by hand, a back test of the T-Bond futures markets proved to me that W. D.
Gann's new Two Day Swing Concept provided two pieces of vital information: First, the
trend direction and second, the points of support and resistance. The manner was simple,
yet brilliant.

Why the T-Bond market for the back test? The 30-year T-Bond contract was chosen for this
test because this is my main trading vehicle, and my understanding of this market's rhythm
is such that if the Two Day Swing did not work well enough, | would spot this quickly, and
not waste any time on further research of this tool

Besides my own working knowledge of this market, the T-Bond futures contract traded on
the CBOT is currently the second largest futures contract in the world. Just yesterday, as |
wnite this, the daily volume was over 400,000 contracts and the open interest was over
500.000 contracts. Not only is this a giant market. but ! believe the most sophisticated
traders are involved There are hedgers, bank traders. scalpers, interest rate players, all
trading for their own reasons and quantities

Therefore, if a trading concept ts going to work, then this is the place where | want to test it
first, So, what were the results? Not only did t find that it held up nicely on the Daily Chart,
but the Intra-day results were also acceptable. After satistying myself on the Daily bars, by
hand charting, | knew the acid test would be in computerizing the entire concept in “real
time,” on a Multiple Tine Frame basis. Fortunately, | already had a real time computer
program, the “Fibonacci Trader®’. that functioned in Multiple Time Frame format, Reat Time
or End of Day.

Much excellent programming was done in the Fibonacci Trader® to bring the entire
technique to the standard of clarity and user friendliness that | required from a trader's point
of view. But the toughest part was still to come.

All of W.D.’s Swing concepts had to be pulled together and integrated with my approach to
formulate a mechanical trading plan that was tradable and profitable. Those of you who
have tried to do this will know exactly what! am talking about This 1s not the time or place
for a detailed discussion, but three points must he mentioned

1. Any “valtd” plan of this mechanical nature must have a simple philosophical basis lt
can be geometric. mathematical, time ornented or any combination thereof

2. Cure fitting or “over-optimizing™ is the Kiss of Death to any mechanical trading plan
Unfortunately, there are programs out there that encourage system designers to do just
that) Robustness ts the key word

3 Must be dynamic enough to change with the market

The concepts and techniques embodied in these plans are sandar to those |use in my
personal trading, incorporating Multiple Time Frames Fibonacci and Gann techniques
Always mechanical, always fixed rules, always with senous back testing

GrMeat

NOTE: All rules work best in netive fast-moving markets and the big profits ote
made trading in active mark«ts. If you follow these rules, you will Makd
money. Make up your mind te follow tha rules before you start and sues
cess is assured,

SPACE CHARTS
RULES FOR ACTIVE MARKETS AT HIGH LEVELS

Many times jn history Wheat has sold at $4.75 tO $3.50 per bushel. These
high prices will recur some day, 80 you need to know how to trade in markets
that move 40 to 20¢ per bushel per day and how to get out near tops and bottoms
because the moves will be so fast that you cannot wait for Trend Line bottoms
to be broken in avery case, and cannot wait for daily bottoms to be broken or
daily tops to be crossed, especially where the range {s 45¢ per bushel a day,
or evon where it is 7 to 40¢ per day.

Whon a market {8 having a rapid advance or a rapid decline of this kind,
you should keep a space chart of 3 points. By this I mean, that during the day,
when Wheat declines 3¢ per bushel from any top; then advances 3¢ per bushel from
any bottom, you should record it. Then the first time that Wheat breake under
a bottom of a 3€-move, consider that the trend has reversed temporarily. This
may only be for one day or for one or two days, but it is a warning to get out.

You should also keep a chart of 4¢ movements if you are watching the tape.
However, when the markets are very active at high prices, I gonsider that the .

best chart to keep is the _movos , wp O/Wn
Dernat OURLY CHART 8

In active, fast-moving markets, where you can get the prices every hour
it {s important to keep the Hourly high and low and also mark the openjng of
the hour and the closing of tha hour.

Apply the sama rules that vou do to your Dai ly high and low chart. The
first timn that the market breaks a Trend Line bettom on the Hourly chart or
crosses a Trend Line top, consider that tho trend has changed temporarily.

If there are a series of hours with tops around the same levol, or bottoms
around the same level, for sevaral hours, then when the market cros6cs 4¢@ per
bushel over an Hourly tep, or breaks 4¢ under an Hourly bettom, consider that
your trend has changed at least temporarily and trady accordingly.

Even in a naorrew mirket er inc morket that is moving 4 to 3¢ par doy, if
you keep an heurly high and lew chart, you will sen the value of it in getting
a quick change in trond,

Al) of thear rules are given you to protect your capital and protect your
profita: to help you get out near the top as porsible and as near the bottom
as prarible. Pan't forget te always use atop less srderc, This is your "smer-

Two "REAL TIME" PLANS AND Two "END OF DAY” PLANS will be shown.

The Real Time Plans are:
A) BASIC PLAN with 10-year back test for the 30-Year T-Bonds.
B) PROFESSIONAL PLAN with a 6-year back test for the 30-Year T-Bonds contract.

The "End of Day” Plans are:

A) BASIC PLAN for five major stocks - IBM, Eli Lilly, Philip Morris, Intel, and J. P. Morgan.
Each with its own 5-year back test.

B) BASIC PLAN for T-Bonds, with a 5-year back test.

This gives a total of 46 years of back testing.

Does this mean that the plans only work on these commodities and stocks? No. Perhaps
you should check into some others.

Starting with the basics we will work up to advanced concepts and techniques. Whilst there
are no Advanced Plans included, there is more than enough to get your teeth into. Perhaps
in my next book { will cover "Advanced or Intra-day Plans".

Not only are the rules for each plan clearly presented, but the majority of this book is taken
up with the "real meat”, ie: the exact history of each and every back test, trade by trade,
chart by chart, rule by rule. | have kept the fluff to a minimum and for that reason this book
is not everyone's cup of tea.

The serious student who will take the time to check through the charts trade by trade will
realize what |am sharing. You can use it as "stand alone" or blend it with your own plan
and your tools.

Many thanks to ail the people who made this book possible. Joe Rondinone, a friend, a
teacher and a great trader, who provided the original Gann courses for this book. My
editor, Thom Hartle, a true professional. Linda Long, who labored late into the night with
super humor. Carlos Toscano de Almeida, our programmer, whose patience deserves a
medal. Thomas Long's technical knowledge was of great help. Doug Shannon for his
excellent help in back testing. There are many others to whom thanks are due for the
kindness they have shown me. Tim Slater of Dow Jones and Co. Jack Schwager, who
interviewed me for "New Market Wizards". Jon Lutsi and Mike Tedesco of Standard &

NEW GANN SWING CHARTISTO

SWING TRADING BASICS AND TERMINOLOGY
Clear definitions of the terms used for this technical approach is required before the
concept can be understood and trading rules applied.

You will find throughout this book that | am fond of definitions; fudging can only cause
problems and losses in the end. Every definition is illustrated by a Chart.

1. SWING DIRECTION

a) What causes the swing direction to change?

b) What causes a pause in the swing direction and then to carry on in the original swing
direction?

2. TREND

a) What causes the trend to change?

b) How does the trend go into Neutral?

3. SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

a) Definition of Support and Resistance.

b) How does Support hold or fail?

c) How does Resistance hold or fail?

4. SLOPE

a) What is the Slope?

b} What ts the difference between Slope and Trend?

All of these definitions are illustrated in the charts that follow. The explanations next to the
charts will enable you to be aware of the concepts.

Please realize that in the beginning we are focusing on one time period only, the Daily

Bars. As we progress, the interesting world of Multiple Time Frames will be covered and
analyzed.

Downtrend when the “Valley* point C’ is passed to the Downside.

3) The Trend can be DOWN and the Slope is also DOWN. This occurs on the Downswing

‘F’to'G). (The trend turned Down at point E as prices dipped below the "Valley" point

‘C’. at 730.00)

Instead, the 2 day retracement stopped at F and as prices went lower this Fo tomneda
LOWER Peak and as prices took out E (previnus Vatley) they collapsed and went down
for 11 daysto G

Please realize, you can use the “mechanical” Basic Plan etc without understanding the
deeper Swing Trading concepts that are described throughout the book But, | know that if
you want to incorporate your own trading tools. a knowledge of these ideas will increase
your confidence. Moreover. these two areas. Dropping Peaks and Rising Valleys may help
you to anticipate potential turning points in the market when they occur at the end of a
move.

Dropping Peaks like D and F gives you two pieces of useful information

1) An attempted upwards retracement in a Downtrend failed. which kept the move ina
Downtrend mode.

2) As soon as Peak’ F formed, you can see it was LOWER than D . a NEW resistance
point was defined by the market at F . Note that D was the High of the entire
previous up move.

These two pieces of information at the high of a move tells us that if has the potential to

develop into a new trend in the opposite direction, Down.

In the Advanced Concept Section we will see how this can be used to "short" (sell) the

market with a Clearly defined stop point that gives us a picture of what our risk may be for
that specific action.

22

Rising "Valleys" ‘G -(1)-!
This set up that happened , ‘the end of a down move (Downslope (F) to G@ ) is almost the
mirror image of the top ‘D' and (F).

In its simplest terms, we were in a Downtrend when (G) occurred. A 3 day Upswing caused
"Peak" H . The market retreated to‘ | ‘for 1 day only. Please realize that all of this time
the market was in a Downtrend mode.

The next day, after’ |); two things happened that rang the wake-up bell.

1) “Valley” I‘was formed the moment "Peak" (H) was taken out. We knew that we had a
Rising Valley set up and we are ready.

2) The very next day the trend CHANGED to Uptrend at X ----- X and to an Upswing. We
are potential buyers. This exact area will be examined in the Advanced Concepts
section in detail. _

3) After’ J formed, a 3 day down move provided us with "Valley" “K). Please note, the low
of this "Valley" point’ K: checked out the failed "Peak" (Resistance) at ‘H? (to the tick, by
the way) to make sure that the failed resistance had become support. Which it had.
Note the nice move up, ie. Uptrend and Upslope.

BASIC GANN SWING CHARTING TECHNIQUE

This is the first analytical concept that we will examine because the techniques used are
relatively simple, and will lead us to the BASIC SWING PLAN" Furthermore. it will lay the
foundation for a deeper understanding of the markets and swing trading techniques in
particular.

We can use the definitions just covered, in this case for 1 time period, the Dally Bars By
virtue of the fact that the Trend as well as Support and Resistance 1s so clearly defined. you
could dovetail your own favorite tools with these concepts

The charts show you the techniques faster than 10.000 words can Nevertheless, if any of
the points are not clear enough you can wiite to me at the address shown on the first page
of this book or at the e-mail address given

As we refer to each definition in greater depth. we can turn them into the simple rules that
follow for our analysis

By checking the terminology and matching it to the appropnate chart you can come to
some simple conclusion. Such as if the trend ts UP and the Slope ts also UP, then it may
be more advisable to “look to buy” rather than to sell Please note | said “look to buy” - |
did not say "Buy". To do that we need an Action Point (trigger) as well as a "Stop" or "Stop
and Reverse" point. We never enter the market without placing a “Stop Loss" in case the
trade goes against us. This way we protect our capital by knowing how much we are
risking before we enter the market.

In the next few pages you will learn one of the simplest tools that | use. The “Hilo
Activator". This functions not only as an Entry Action point but also as a Trailing Stop and
as a "Stop Loss" point.

Before | detail the HiLo Activator, it is important to discuss the concept of "Energy
Termination", because it is the termination of energy that sets up the Peaks and Valleys
shown in Charts. 7 and 7A. And it is those Peaks and Valleys that define the change in the
Trend as well as defining Support and Resistance

| tend to look at the movement of prices and the changes thereto as “vibrations” The
vibration of prices can be called energy Therefore, prices reach a High’ and then proceed
downwards, which can only happen when the “Buying Energy reached a Peak and then tt
“Terminated" (ie: the buying ceased) Thus. tt can be called a termination of energy’. the
vibration stopped. At first glance this may appear theoretical and of no practical value, but
itis this concept that will eventuatly set up the trading of Multipte Time Peniods within the
contines of Support/Resistance of “own” and the “Higher’ time penods swings

Quoting W. 0. Gann from many years ago
“After years of patient study | have proven to my entire Satisfaction as well as demonstrated
to others that vibration explains every possible phase and condition of the market ”

So, we find at the extremes of moves (top or bottom) that vibrations are at their maximum
within the confines of the price swings we are analyzing, especially the "time frame" we are
trading. It is the extremes of the higher time periods that define the top or bottom of the
major trend. This will be discussed in the “Advanced Concepts" section.

Let us now look at the Trigger we use for the Basic Swing Plan.

HiLo ACTIVATOR

This simple tool will actas our Entry Trigger as wellas a Teaiing Stop) You can see mis in
the Rules that follow for the Basic Swing Plan

In reality, this is a simple moving average of the Highs and the Lows but plotted in an
unusual manner For this indicator we add the last three period s Highs (or Lows) and
divide the sum by three This must include the fatest bar, The resultis then plotted in such
a way that, for Real Time action. we have a honzontal Live tine to uthze For End of Day it
is plotted one period forward, so that you have a honzontal price point to act with tomorrow
Please see illustrations on previous page

As a side note, of course | am aware that within 5 minutes of this book being published, all
of the vultures out there will copy these ideas into thei program) Especially the
“gentlemen” who have never traded in thei lives So, what can |! do about that? | quote
Rudyard Kipling, the British poet from the 19th century

“And they asked me how | do it and
1 gave them the Scripture text,

You keep your light so shining a
hitle in front o the next

They copied all they could follow,
but they could not copy my mind

And | left ‘em sweating and stealing
a year and a half behind..."

All of the rules illustrated for the Basic Swing Plan and the charts that follow show clearly
the effect of the "HiLo Activator’. Once a “Buy” set up Is activated, the HiLo Sell Stop
follows the rising market plotted below the rising bars, and a “Sell” setup ts exactly the
opposite.

This step formation is visually easy to follow and once you get used to it then you know the
market is up until you get a "Close" below the HiLo Activator Sell Stop, the Buy Stop will
then appear. Of course, you can do this by hand, it's easy as | did it for years. The
simplicity of it may deceive you to believe that it may be of little value. Check it out first
before you make that judgement. At this stage, we are talking only about the Daily HiLo
Activator on the Daily bars.

This leads us into the Basic Swing Plan. Please remember, it is based on W. D. Gann's
concepts, for the 30 Year T-Bonds. The 10 years results and trade by trade charts follow
the illustrated rules.

SUGGESTED MINI-CHECKLIST FOR BASIC PLAN

After you have absorbed the simple rules for this plan and worked your way through the
results day by day trade by trade you may want to consider setting up a Daily Checklist

Example:
Direction of TREND UP J DOWN J
Position of Hilo Activator ABOVE .) BELOW |

Price Point of previous VALLEY
Price Point of previous PEAK
Price Point of 38°. Retracement

Also, have a place for the Date and the Number of Contracts As there are basically only
three rules and two qualifiers, a personalized checklist should be easy to prepare.

The importance of this is to establish your own frame of reference and set up a daily
routine. Your planning should be done before and not when you enter the trade. | suggest
that you write down the actual trade and read that to your broker. Less mistakes will be
made if you fallow this plan.

ROUTINE FOR CHECKING RESULTS AND BACKTEST

The Backtest results are divided into separate columns from Left to Right.
TRADE #1: This shows the trade number that matches the circled trade number on the
actual charts. If you see PP, it means that a Profit Protection rule was hit.

R NAL SWING PLA TIME
GENERAL NOTES AND COMMENTS

This plan is very different to the Basic Plan. The emphasis is on trading in harmony
with the daily rhythm of the markets.

Trading is all about following the direction and speed of a river. The markets, like the
river, will always take the course of feast resistance. This plan tries to do the same.
Commissions are cheap compared to being on the wrong side of the market.

Accurate and consistent execution of this pian calls for vigilance and full focus. Also,
you must be willing to not marry a position; change direction if the market demands it.
That is why it is called a Professional Plan.
The major difference to the Basic Plan can be listed as followed:
1. This plan trades against the trend as well as with the trend.
2. Profit Protection rules are used so hard earned profits are not given back too easily.
3. We take profits at Target points on part of our total position (each new trade is 3
contracts, see Check List of Results).
Note: these target points are market denominated and not some arbitrary money
amount dreamt up by you or me.

4. You can add (Pyramid) to your position under specific conditions.

5. Re-entering the market if you got out (via the rules) too early is an integral part of
the plan.

6. The HiLo Activator of the WEEKLY plotted into the Daily bars becomes a functional
rule for this plan. This introduces you to the concept of Multiple Time Frames and
how useful they can be for mechanical trading plans.

ALL THE RULES ARE ILLUSTRATED. THE MORE COMPLEX RULES ARE FULLY

DETAILED. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THEM CLEARLY BEFORE YOU START
CHECKING OUT THE 6-YEAR BACK TEST.

ESTIONS FOR A DAI E IST

It is suggested that you study the rules and check out the results trade by trade before
you design your own checklist. Yes, | know it is a lot of work and it would be easier if |
provided one for you. But, | also know that if you do it for yourself, it will have much
more meaning at a subconscious level.

Many of you are aware that | have worked with traders for 20 years helping with their
psychological approach to trading. Over the years | have learned that trading and
analysis are two different disciplines.

Relaxed trading needs confidence, not just at the conscious level (that is the easy part).
But, as 75% of trading is a psychological affair that can only be mastered if your
subconscious mind is also satisfied that you have a valid trading methodology.

To be a competent analyst satisfying your mind at a conscious level is sufficient, but to
be a truly competent trader it is your subconscious mind that must be totally satisfied.
How can we attempt to do this?

The simplest route is to do as much Back track (back test) as you possibly can. This
fulfills two jobs:

Firstly, you learn the rules; feel them in your very bones. It helps you to understand
how they perform under fire, when things go against you. After a multi year back track,
you will know that if you had 4 or 5 losses consecutively, and yet the plan survived.
When it occurs in reai trading (as surely it will) you will not be shocked, and you will be
able to take the next trade. That is what trading is all about.

My attitude is on public record: without a back tested plan with fixed rules, you have
nothing. That is, if you want to use a mechanical plan.

Secondly, and believe it or not, this is the more important of the two; through the
process of repetition, repetition, repetition, the subconscious starts accepting the
validity of the plan. The more repetition, checking those trades day by day, rule by rule,
the greater the chance of total acceptance at a subconscious level. Of course, if your
plan does not have positive mathematical expectations then alt the back testing in the
world will be of no use (continued on page 269).

LAWS OF MULTIPLE TIME FRAMES©

1. EVERY TIME FRAME HAS ITS OWN STRUCTURE.
2. THE HIGHER TIME FRAMES OVERRULE THE LOWER TIME FRAMES.

3. PRICES IN THE LOWER TIME FRAME STRUCTURE TEND TO RESPECT
THE ENERGY POINTS OF THE HIGHER TIME FRAME STRUCTURE.

4. THE ENERGY POINTS OF SUPPORT: RESISTANCE CREATED BY THE
HIGHER TIME FRAME’S VIBRATION (PRICES) CAN BE VALIDATED BY THE
ACTION OF THE LOWER TIME PERIODS.

5. THE TREND CREATED BY THE NEXT TIME PERIOD ENABLES US TO
DEFINE THE TRADABLE TREND.

6. WHAT APPEARS TO BE CHAOS IN ONE TIME PERIOD CAN BE ORDER IN
ANOTHER TIME PERIOD.

364

MULTIPLE TIME FRAMES

A SIMPLE EXPLANATION

Any time period that you are interested in for trading or analysis has its own trend as well
as its own Support and Resistance levels. Once you know what the direction of the trend is
and where the Support and Resistance points are, you have an important part of what you
need.

Actually, trading is a much simpler process than most people imagine. Complications arise
due to the mindset that "more is better’, "Ah, if 1 had just one more confirmation", or "| need
one more crossing of that exponential! moving average, then it will give me the 5 indicators
confirming the signal." Of course, by then, the move is over!

The reality is that the structure of each time period is different. | am convinced that Gann
was right and the markets are geometric in nature. Because each time period has its own

structure, we are able to define the trend and the Support/Resistance levels for that specific

period.

The 60-minute trend may be different to the Daily trend, yet it is part of that Daily trend, it
has to be because without the 60-minute trend, the Daily trend could not exist. In other
words, each time period is a self contained universe, yet it is very much a part of larger
structure, both in price and in time. If this sounds like "Fractals” made famous by the
Mandelbrot set, you are correct.

The Sierspinski gasket is an excellent representation of how a 5-minute bar chart is an
integral part of the 15-minute, 30-minute, 60-minute, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly charts.
The Sierspinski mathematical model shows a complicated concept at a simple level.

used to show a simple
triangle, representing the
Monthly bar, produced by
breaking it up into
successively smaller
units, ending up with, say,
the 5-minute bars.

365

For trading purposes, we are interested only in three time frames.

OWN - NEXT - HIGH
Example:
If you are trading or analyzing the Daily bars, then that is defined as OWN period. The
NEXT time period is the Weekly bar. The HIGH time period ts the Monthly bar.

Going down the scale for intraday trading using the 30-minute bars, then your multiple time
frame setup could look like this:

30-Minute Bars) = OWN period
Daily Bars = NEXT period
Weekly Bars = HIGH period

For practical purposes, | will focus only on two time frames: OWN and NEXT. You will
soon see why.

The definition of trend, as well as Support/Resistance, is kept the same irrespective of what
lime period we are looking at. Keeping the definition for all time periods the same enables

us to define action points of the Daily bars (OWN Period) within the confines of the Weekly
bars (NEXT Time Period).

In other words, we can use the Weekly (NEXT Period) trend and Support/Resistance points
to guide us when and where to take action via the Daily bars (OWN Period). Why?
Because the Weekly vibrations overrule the Daily. Please bear with me; the Advanced
Charts will show the concept clearly.

What you are going to find is that the Weekly trend may be UP, but the Daily trend may be
DOWN. itis these divergences between the two time periods that sometimes provide
trading opportunities, because the Weekly trend can be more powerful than the Daily trend.

And the Weekly Support/Resistance areas are stronger than the Daily Support/Resistance
areas.

Naturally, the Daily trend will change before the Weekly, as it is the shorter time period. Of
course, the 45-minute trend on an intraday chart will change faster than the Daily, for the
same reason. Furthermore, Support (or Resistance) based on the Daily bars will be tested
and possibly fail before the Support (or Resistance) based on the Weekly bars.

The first point to realize is that, like the Sierspinski gasket, a simple Weekly bar is produced
by smaller units, in this case the 5 Daily bars.

ADVANCED CHART #1

Each Week; 1-4 is composed of five Daily bars. By drawing a “box" around the 5 days that
make up the trading week, you can see not only the Weekly bar but also the price activity
that took place during that week, on a Daily basis.

FIBONACCI TRADER (c} Robert Krauaz - Encapsulavon - Patent sppeed for

f@M.OLY O- W-MEOO 8/2/87 22:08

In this way, you capture the price vibrations for two time periods in one picture. This
process is called ENCAPSULATION (in fact, | have applied for a patent for this). As we
progress, the importance of this will become clear, as soon as we plot the Gann Swings for
the Daily bars and the Gann Swing for the Weekly bars into one *Composite Swing
Chart’.

ADVANCED CHART #2

This is the same IBM chart as Chart #1 but with the Daily Gann Swings plotted on the Daily
bars. Please remember, Solid Line = Uptrend - Dashed Line = Downtrend. Note: During
Week 3 on Thursday, the trend changed to UP. (Dashed Line changed to Solid Line when
prices took out the previous Peak = week 2, Wednesday.)

One week tater the prices gapped up nicely. Did someone know something?

ADVANCED CHART #3

In this chart | have removed the "Encapsulation" and shown another six weeks of Daily
bars so you can get a feel of how the Daily swing picture develops. You can see that this
potential trend reversal was again set up by Rising Valleys. (Which were the Low daily bars
of Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4.) More on this (ater.

ADVANCED CHART #4

This is an important chart. Please be sure you understand it. The “boxes” that surround
the daily bars, in fact represent the WEEKLY bars. See Week 1, 2, 3 and 4, written from
the bottom of the move upwards.

The Gann Swings displayed on this chart are the WEEKLY Swings derived from the
WEEKLY bars.

ALL DEFINITIONS REMAIN THE SAME FOR THE WEEKLY BARS AS FOR THE DAILY
BARS.

This includes Change of Swing direction. Please go back and check all of the definitions
given in "Swing Trading Basics and Terminology". Because the definitions for both time
periods are the same, we can apply the same logic to both.

When analyzing the Weekly swing you are interested in two things for starters. Direction of
Slope and Trend. We define the Slope as immediate direction of the swing. From the
Weekly Valley: 2° up to the Weekly Peak 3 the Weekly swing was in UPSLOPE mode.

From the Weekly Peak 3° down to Weekly Valley 4 the Weekly swing was ina
DOWNSLOPE mode. As the slope defines the immediate direction of the market that is the
direction we should be looking to trade in, via the Daily bars.

What does this mean? Simply put, if the Weekly Slope is UP we can look to buy, if and
when the Daily bars give a buy signal. Don't worry, examples coming up. Conversely, if

the Weekly Slope is DOWN we can look to sell when the Daily bars give a sell signal.

So, during the Weekly Downslope from 3 to 4 you could be looking for an opportunity to
sell the Daily in the direction of the Weekly Slope. These charts show IBM and | will also
use some other contracts to demonstrate these ideas, so you can see they are not
exclusive to US T-Bonds. The small "blob" on the right hand side of each weekly "box"
(Encapsulation) is the closing price of the week.

ADVANCED CHART #5 GANN SWING COMPOSITE CHART

This charts shows BOTH the Daily and the Weekly swings in one chart. Swings 2 3 4
are the Weekly, as in Chart 4. The Daily swings are labelled A- B- C - D-€E - F.
You can also see when the Daily trend changed as prices took out the Daily Peak "C" and
when the Weekly trend changed as prices passed the Weekly Peak 3 . The Daily trend
changed to UP before the Weekly.

Itis the Rising Valley D that forced the Daily trend to change. Also note that the Rising
Valley's D and F pushed the Weekly to eventually change trend as it took out the Weekly
Peak 3.

This is what W. D. Gann had to say about higher bottoms (Rising Valleys) some 50 years
ago:

"After commodities make a bottom and start in advance, if they continue to make higher
bottoms and higher tops the trend is up."

In the same paragraph, he added:

"After it makes a third higher Bottom on a swing and goes through to a new high level or
crosses the last top resistance level, it is indication of much higher prices."

The market is telling you, if you get Rising Daily Valleys then the opportunity exists for the
Daily trend to change. This may give rise to a trend change on the Weekly. Although the
Weekly trend did not change to UP until the 75.00 area, you did not have to wait to buy only
after that point, because not only did you have Rising Daily Valleys but also the Weekly
changed to an UPSLOPE long before this trend change occurred.

In reality the mechanical plans covered are stand alone plans. The concepts discussed

here serve three purposes.

1. A better understanding of swing trading.

2. The realization that the lower time frames are an integral part of the higher time frames
(fractals). The next step is to harness this knowledge by acting in the direction of the
higher time periods trend and/or slope.

3. Eventually, for you to set up your own trading plan, either stand alone or incorporating
your own tools.

Now let's go back to Advanced Chart #5. This is where the grasp of "Swing Trading

372

Basics" defined at the start of the book becomes important.

You can see that the Weekly swing from Peak ‘3) to Valley (4.))was in an Uptrend by our
definition but, it was in Downslope mode. Only at approximately 68.25 did the Weekly
change to a Downtrend and Downslope mode.

But, the important point to realize is that the Daily was in a Downtrend mode all the time. In
fact, from Daily Peak ‘down to Daily Valley By, the Weekly and the Daily were in
tandem. Both Downtrend and Downslope.

To wait for this set up ts too late if you are trading the Daily bars. Therefore, froma
practical point of view, it is the Weekly Slope (ie: the immediate direction of the Weekly
swing) that is crucial if you are analyzing or trading the Daily bars.

ADVANCED CHART #6
Once again this is a Composite chart. This time working with a recent daily Wheat chart
that shows the Weekly and the Daily swings in one picture.

The Weekly swing from Peak ‘1° to Valley (2)is clearly in DOWNSLOPE mode for eleven
weeks. (Even though the Weekly trend was up.) By the time the Weekly trend changed to
a Downtrend, the move was nearly over.

The lesson is: IF you are using two time frames (ie: the Daily and the Weekly) pay attention
to the Slope of the Weekly. You will find most of your winners will come when you trade the
Daily bars in the Direction of the Weekly Slope.

Let's have a closer look at this 150 cent down move in the Wheat. At the simplest level
there was a potential short sale when the Daily changed to a Downtrend as Daily Valley "B"
was taken out at X ----- x,

Listen up!

There were 4 pieces of important information given to us by the market. Yes, 4.
1) Dropping Daily Peaks. Daily Peak "C" was lower than "A".

2) The Daily was in a Downslope from “C" to "E".

3) The Daily trend changed to Down at X ----- x.

4) The Weekly slope was Down (Downslope).

Where could your stop be? The only two logical market driven places can be Daily Peak
"C" or Daily Peak "A". Why? Because these are nearest true resistance points, if you are
swing trading.

So, which one to use? "A" or "C"? Obviously, the nearest. ie: "C" would be easier to hit.
But, there are other points that should be taken into consideration before you decide.
Firstly, if you are using multiple contracts, you could use both. That is one of the reasons |

at "C" and 2/3 at "A" or the other way around. It depends on your plan.

The Second point is, what percentage of your capital does a loss at point "A" or "C"
represent? What percentage of your trading capital, as far as margin is concerned, does
this 3 lot in the Wheat represent? Have you backtested this entry and exit concept?
Where is your trailing stop? Could you use the HiLo Activator on the Wheat also?

Hard questions have to be asked to become a competent professional trader. That's why
some 90° fail. It's the hardest way to make an easy living. From Daily Peak (E) down to
F is a dream trade, but note the following:

The Weekly Slope is Down.

The Daily Slope is Down.

The Daily is in Downtrend.

Does that say anything to you?

, Let's look a litter closer at how this down move is trying to reverse even as | write this today
(8/5/97). The Daily trend changed to Up, when for the first time after 11 weeks of
Downtrend, a previous Daily Peak "K" was surpassed. As soon as Valley "L" formed, you
s knew it was higher than Daily Valley "J", which was the low of the entire move. You got it -
Rising Valleys.

and stayed down for 11 weeks

X-€ Daily changed to Downtrend

This potential bottoming process in Chart 6 was crystal clear. If it was that simple all the
time swing trading would be easy. But, you would be surprised how often it happens if you
watch a variety of contracts in the Futures Markets and heavily traded shares in the Stock
Market. There are three patterns to keep an eagle eye on.

Just because Advanced concepts are being looked at, it does not mean you can't use
various rules to enter or exit the market from the mechanical plans. During Week 1,
Wednesday prices closed below the Daily HiLo Activator and the Daily was in an Uptrend.
This was a "sell" via the Professional Plan, Contra Trend Rule (check it out please). The
Buy stop came up showing your trailing stop. This potential sell signal is indicated by a

is If you do a few years backtest on the Wheat, taking the same entry signal (Contra Trend /
close below sell stop rule in the Professional Plan), see how far prices move in your favor
on the average, calculate the minimum. {f they move in your favor, then check if it is worth
it (ie: commissions, risk, etc.). Let us say that this comes out at 6¢, which is $300 per
contract. If the statistics confirm it then that becomes your "preset" profit point for say 1/3
of your total contracts. That should pay for the trade. Treat your trading as a business. In
this case, the short entry was at 435 3/4 and the low of that first down move at (B) was
416 1/4 = over 19¢ move per contract ($950). Wednesday of Week 2 closed above the
Daily HiLo Activator buy stop; if you followed the rules of the Professional Plan you would
have been out of the trade totally at say, 432 1/4. (On Wheat intraday, | suggest you allow
8 3¢ for the Profit Protection Rule 2. Yes, | know the plan states a 2 tick penetration past the
HiLo buy stop intraday > BUT that is for T-Bonds.) A profit of only 3¢ per contract. But, if
you had a "preset" then one contract would yield 6¢. Clear?

Next period's properties can give you superior information.

SLOPE

Trade Entry via the 50-minute bars in the direction of the Daily Slope can improve the odds
of a successful trade. During the Daily Upslope ‘ D: to 'E}, a "Long" position is more likely
to “hit the spot”. The same thought applies to selling during the Daily Downslope ‘E) to‘F.

What makes this concept different from other types of swing trading is that we use the 50-
minutes’ price activity within the Daily confines of Support/Resistance. In other words, we
trade the 50-minute bars using the Daily energy points.

Look at swing C down to (D’. The moment (D) was formed your Daily Support and
Resistance levels were defined. So far so good. If It prices proceeded upwards and
surpassed Daily Peak (C’, as shown by (C)--------- (X), then the potential existed for higher

prices. Why? Because the Daily Peak that represents Resistance failed and prices went
higher.

Now, after D. formed and if prices had gone down instead of up, then the support of the
Daily Valley _D’ could have failed. Furthermore, as (D) was the previous Valley, as per our
definition, the Daily trend would have turned down. You can see this occurred on Day 12
as prices eventually crossed and closed below horizontal line (D)-------- (X),

Well. having said that, how could you utilize this concept to trade the 50-minute bars? Any
time during Upslope ‘D - E) you could have looked to buy via the 50-minute if you got a
buy signal. Let's look ata few choices. You could take any retracements with a clearly
defined stop loss at‘D?. You could have bought as soon as Upslope (D (D) - © started. You
could have used one of your own favorite entry signals, as the Daily slope and the Daily
trend were up. You could have bought the breakout above Peak (C) on the first 50-minute
bar's close above the horizontal line (C)--------- (X). You could easily think of taking a long
position if the 50-minute bar closes above the HiLo Activator buy stop of the 50-minute,
because that is the time frame we are working with.

This is shown on ADVANCED CHART 8A (which is a zoom of Chart #8). During Day 9 the
fourth 50-minute bar of that day closed above the HiLo Activator buy stop. Marked with an
arrow. Remember, the Daily trend was Up, the Slope was also Up. Of course Daily Valley
(D) was above Daily Valley ‘B) = Rising Valleys. And we have not yet started to look at the
50-minute swings and how they show potential combinations with the Daily Gann Swings.

ADVANCED CHART #9

Chart 9 does exactly that; it combines the Daily and 50-minute Gann Swings with the HiLo
Activator of the 50-minute. As you saw in Chart 8A, potential action was indicated on Day
9. Yes, the arrow is still there. But, now look at the 50-minute swings (H) -C1)-(J). During
Day 9, the first 50-minute bar of the day surpassed the previous 50-minute Peak‘ around
115-16. The 50-minute had been in a Downtrend. 2 ticks past that previous Peak‘ | )the

50-minute turned positive, into an Uptrend. Three bars tater, the same day, the HiLo
Activator buy stop was hit.

Let's recap. A) The 50-minute changed to an Uptrend. B) The 50-minute was in Upslope
mode. C) The Daily was in Upsiope mode and in an Uptrend. D) The 50-minute's buy stop
was hit. Now that's potential.

SWING DIRECTION & NEUTRAL SLOPE

These 7 charts will exptain the following:
A) How the Swing changes direction.
B) How the Trend changes direction.

C) How the Swing becomes Neutral.

SWING DIRECTION CHART #1

Kicks off the action working our way through bar by bar. The Low of Bar 1 shows the end

of a Downswing. As you can see, the Daily Trend is Up but the Slope is Down (the swing

line is Sotid = Uptrend).

On Bar 2 the Slope changes to up, BUT because we need TWO CONSECUTIVE Higher
highs ONLY the Slope is changing and not the Swing. This line is drawn thinner than the
Swing line. In the Fibonacci Trader® program it is plotted as a thin white line. Also note
that because it is not yet a proper swing in the opposite direction, this thin white line is
plotted to Bar 2’s close (and not to the bar's high, if that only happens on a proper swing in

the opposite direction). When this occurs, | call it "Neutral". You will soon see the reason

why.

Please look at Chart #2. This shows the next day, Bar 3. On this day the prices once
again go down. At this point the previous Daily Downslope is reestablished and something

else happens. Correct. The previous Valley is taken out and the Trend changes to Down.
Yet, on Bar 4, again the Downtrend stalls, signified by a thin upslope plotted to the close of

Bar 4. You can see this on Chart #3. Once again the swing is Neutral. As you have only

one higher high but we need two consecutively for the slope to change.

Chart #4 shows what happens when this occurs. Bar 5 gives us two consecutive higher
highs and the Upslope is defined. Note: the Trend 1s still Down. Aiso, the Dashed line now
goes to the high of Bar 5. Of course. you had a close above the Hilo Activator buy stop

(Automatic).

Chart #5 shows you the prices heading higher but. by Swing charting definition. the Trend

is still down and will stay down until the previous Peak is surpassed Classic Downtrend

but Upslope.

Chart #6 shows the Bar 9 making a Swing high, but not yet taking out the previous Peak
around 116-08. On Bar 10 we get a Neutral slope plotted to Bar 10's close. Please note
how the HiLo Activator followed the entire upmove. So. Bar 10s Neutral slope shows a
stalling of the upward march of the market. Not surprising. as pnces are so close to the

previous Peak (Resistance).

Chart #7. Bingo. Bar 11 smashed above the Previous Peak and the trend changes to Up.

Will you look at that close? But, please remember when the slope turned up, you had a

clearly defined Upslope on Bar 5.

| could have shown you hundreds of Multiple Time Frame applications.
The purpose of this Advanced section was to introduce you to the concept
and the real potential of Gann Swing trading using 2 time periods. If it started
your creative juices flowing, then the effort was well worth it.

PROFIT PROTECTION IF LONG RULE #1

If prices "close" below the HiLo Activator Sell Stop then close out all Long positions.
This happens on Bar (A). This “close" must be at least 2 ticks below the HiLo Activator.
Also the HiLo Activator must have "flipped", as shown on Bar(A). (ie: if the close is 2
ticks below the Sell Stop, then the buy stop will appear on the computer monitor screen.

Dear Trader,

Many thanks for your letters, compliments and questions. These four charts should help you to
understand the HiLo calculation better. Please realize that in the Fibonacci Trader® program real-time,
when, say, the HiLo Activator buy stop is penetrated by the price on the T-bonds by two ticks, the HiLo
Activator sell stop comes up real time, but if the prices close back below the buy stop, then the sell stop
disappears. This is like a warning sign - that is, the traffic light turning yellow.

Of course, none of this affects the results, the charts or the rules in the Gann Treasure book.

CHART 1: REAL-TIME MODE
Because the calculation includes the third period, that is, the "live" bar (in real-time mode), the
actual HiLo point falls on this live bar, making it difficult to see. (As we want this indicator to be
dynamic, we must include the live bar in the calculation; that's obvious.)

Many real-time charting programs have the facility to plot the moving average point back or
forward as needed. The program used for this book, the Fibonacci Trader®, does this

automatically.

CHART 2: REAL-TIME MODE
This shows that the HiLo calculation that was on Bar 3 in the previous chart is now plotted just
behind Bar 3, as a point with a short horizontal line that now lies across Bar 3. Check it out.

Please note: The price level of the HiLo Activator buy stop does not change.

In this chart, Bar 3 closed above the buy stop, thus activating Buy Rule #1 (for the basic plan, if
the trend is up).

CHART 3: END-OF-DAY MODE
If you're using the end-of-day mode, you must move the HiLo Activator buy stop one day forward.
Therefore, on the close of Day 3, the buy stop will be in Day 4's column. So you will be aware
today where the buy stop is for tomorrow.

Please realize that you would be able to act only on the open of Day 4, as prices gapped, hitting

the buy stop, as prices opened.

CHART 4: END-OF-DAY MODE FOR IBM
How did the Basic Plan survive Blue Monday's big drop on October 27, 19972
See page 29 for the Basic Plan Rules. Trade 1 went short via trend change Rule 2, marked as

“X—x” on the chart. This short was taken during the day, because you knew this price point — the

UPDATE & EXPLANATION

TO

"A W.D. GANN TREASURE DISCOVERED"

Many thanks for your comments and questions. Hopefully, this Update will cover most of them.
To those of you who wrote to say thanks and are using the ideas profitably, | say 'well done -
keep up the good work’. This applies especially to those who took advantage of the $25.00
offer to try the Fibonacci Trader™ program for 30 days to check out the rules in the book and
to look at other commodities and shares of your choice.

Here are some answers:
1. The book (and I) only use the data for T-Bonds for the Day Session only.
2. If you currently update the "back adjusted" data for the Bonds, you may not get exactly the

same price points as in the book. Of course, for Stocks and Shares it will be the same
unless there has been a split in the stock, since publication.

HiLo ACTIVATOR - WEEKLY ("NEXT" TIME PERIOD)
If you are using the Professional Plan (page 257) then the HiLo Activator of the WEEKLY
comes into play via the rules for that plan. Most of you realized by looking at the charts for
this plan that we need to recalculate the Weekly HiLo Activator IF a New High or New Low
is made during the week. IE: Recalculate and replot if you get a new High or Low during
the week. Of course, the Fibonacci Trader™ program does this automatically in Real Time,
as this trading plan uses "real time" data.

PEAKS & VALLEYS
Lots of questions about this...

A) When using the "Re-Entry Rule", the plan uses "Minor Peaks/Valleys". It does NOT wait
for the Gann Swing Peaks or Valleys.

B) Can one use these "Minor Peaks/Valleys" for earlier entry at other times? The answer
is "MAYBE" (but, this is not part of the plan.) | suggest that you check it VERY carefully on
the contract of your choice. See charts below. Under Section 6, which shows these "Minor
Peaks/Valleys'.

5. Why doesn't the Swing always go to the Lowest Low or the Highest High? Especially the
setup of Chart #7A (page 21 in the book) was questioned. Point #6 PLUS the attached
charts should answer your questions.
