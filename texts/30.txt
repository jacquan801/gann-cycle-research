Market Trader is applicable for ALL Markets. It self-educates with past historical prices using three different
MODULES that employ artificial intelligence: Super Bradley, Super BlackBox and Easy Expert. MARKET
TRADER utilizes Neural Net mathematics along with artificial intelligence, statistics and probability to make
future projections for any market: Futures, Commodities, Options, etc. This will greatly increase your ability
to locate dates of critical turning points to make better trades. All this is done in an elegant window format
and also contains many of AIR Software’s powerful, unique modules.
Many of our users claim that the EASY EXPERT module in the Market Trader Pro is worth $10,000 AS
A STAND ALONE APPLICATION. MANY SERIOUS TRADERS PROCLAIM THAT it is the most
ACCURATE TRADING MACHINE available!

time trend targets.
     The practical trading strategy will first recognize the signal
on the larger time frame and the trade will be executed on the
smaller time frame to reduce capital exposure for the trade.
In our next example, the initial trade set-up will be a go-short      Chart 3
signal on the 60-minute data and the trade will then be exe-
cuted on the next signal on the 15-minute data.
     Chart #4 is the 60-minute data for the S&P for part of the
period we have already reviewed. This chart focuses on just
two of the crossover signals. On the afternoon of Sept. 12, a
crossover was made. I have used this example because the indi-
cator was not in what is commonly known as the “overbought”
zone but just above the lower zone. As soon as the 60-minute
data signals the set-up conditions by making a crossover from
down, we go to the lower time frame and 15-minute data for
the actual entry signal.
     Chart #5 is the 15-minute data for the period at and fol-
lowing the Sept. 12 signal on the 60-minute data. Right after
the 60-minute signal, the 15-minute data made a crossover
signal to execute a short position. The S&P accelerated the
bear trend following the signal – exactly what usually hap-
pens. Remember that the signal reversal usually represents the
acceleration of the trend, not necessarily a price high. The S&P
quickly declined 20 points or more. Another signal was made
two day’s later and again was followed an acceleration of the
bear trend for 20-points or more.
     Chart #5 also shows the crossovers from down to up. Why?
Once a crossover from down to up is made, it is the latest time
to begin trailing the stop very close to the market. This tuto-
rial has only considered one part of the DT Indicator Crossover       Chart 4
Strategy - the entry strategy. The other two parts of the strat-
egy are where the initial protective stop is placed and how to
use the indicator position to adjust the stop as the market prog-
ress. We will address those two parts of the strategy in a future
article.
     You have now learned a logical procedure how to use at least
two time frames for the set-up conditions and trade execution
using an indicator. Our web site, www.DynamicTraders.com,
includes dozens of free trade tutorials that will teach you more
trend-reversal and trend-continuation trading strategies.
     This article used Dynamic Trader’s unique StoRSI indi-
cator for the examples. Most indicators work about the same
way. The same principles apply regardless of which indicator
is used. Test your indicator on several time frames to discover
the best settings for each time frame.

     Gann’s geometric angles are trend lines drawn from promi-       away for a given price P. At a time t+1 price would meet the
nent tops or bottoms at certain angles. The most important           curve at price P1. Now, lets solve for the slope of the trend line

meant by the phrase ‘squaring time and price.’ However,              P1 = (t + 1) ^ 2 = t ^ 2 + 2 t + 1 = P + 2 t + 1
Don’s Pyrapoint method gave me a new insight, which is:
Price = Time squared or P = t ^ 2                                    Slope = (Change in price) / (Change in time)
     Let me take this mathematical relationship and develop it
in this article. The above relationship between price and time       Change in price = P1 - P = P + 2 t + 1 - P = 2 t + 1 = 2 t

     For the sake of illustration, let’s suppose a prominent top
