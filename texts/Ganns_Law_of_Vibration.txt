GANN’S GREAT DISCOVERY OF AUGUST 8TH, 1908

Almost one hundred years ago, Gann made one of his

More specifically, as Gann recorded in his booklet entitled
“Why Money is Lost on Commodities and Stocks and How to        1. Stocks and commodities (and everything else on earth)
Make Profits” (1954):                                             vibrate. Moreover, vibration provides a comprehensive

On August 8, 1908, Gann was 30 years old. Moreover,
he was 76 years old when in 1954 he wrote his booklet          2. Stocks and commodities vibrate in accordance with
