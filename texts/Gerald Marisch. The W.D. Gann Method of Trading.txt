INTRODUCTION

“You can make a fortune by following this one rule alone. Acareful study and
review of past movements in any commodity will prove to you, beyond a doubt,
that this rule works, and that you can make profits following it.”

How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities, 1942, p. 36

Any trader, from the novice to the professional, who is aware of the futures
markets knows that tremendous profit potential exists in trading futures. Yet,
it seems almost impossible to learn all the trading rules and “caveats” of futures
trading, and then to put them into practice.

A computer and software can give a trader many advantages. Automated
data retrieval, stochastics, RSI calculations, and Elliott Wave counts can all be
done in minutes, rather than hours, with less work and greater accuracy.

A beginning trader, though, may not own a computer. It may be acostly and
time-consuming effort, sorting through the maze of investment software, plus
the numerous technical-analysis methods and “systems” that are offered today.
Terms such as extended 5th waves and oscillators, and the names of Fibonacci
and Wilder, may be completely foreign to the new trader. Systems with exotic
names, all of which seem to promise wealth, only add to the confusion.

The new trader looks for something that is clear, simple and easy to
understand; some trading method that can be used to increase a trader’s
confidence - and a trader’s account.

This book was written to give a new trader answers and information. It does
not contain a sure-fire method of making a fortune overnight. It DOES present
guidelines to help the beginning trader earn consistent profits, while answering
some of his questions. The guidelines are based on established rules that are
surprisingly simple, yet dramatically effective for profiting from the markets.

The rules follow the “KISS” axiom of Keep It Simple, Stupid. They have
stood the test of time for any market, for any period, and for any amount of capital
the trader wishes to risk.

The rules are based on Gann’s 50% Retracement Rule.

PARTI

Gann... His Rules and His Angles

William D. Gann was a trader of the early 20th century. His abilities for
profiting from the stock and commodity markets remain unchallenged. Gann’s
methods of technical analysis for projecting both price and time targets are
unique. Even today, his methods have yet to be fully duplicated.

Known as “The Master Trader,” W. D. Gann was born in 1878, in Lufkin,
Texas. Gann netted over $50,000,000 from the markets during his trading
career, averaging a success rate for trades of 80% to 90%. It has been said that
Gann could very well have been right ALL the time. Any losses incurred by him
were only there by his own design and not because of any faults with his methods.

His successes are legendary. Gann literally converted small accounts into
fortunes, increasing their net balances by several hundred percent. There are
numerous examples of his trading successes, among which are these:

1908 - a $130 account increased to $12,000 in 30 days.
1923 - a $973 account increased to $30,000 in 60 days.

1933 - 479 trades were made with 422 being profitable. This is an accuracy
of 88% and 4000% profit!

1946 - A 3-month net profit of $13,000 from starting capital of $4500 - a
400% rate of return.

The following paragraph appeared in the December 1909 issue of “Ticker”
Magazine. It was written by R. D. Wyckoff, the former owner and editor of the
“Ticker,” and describes Gann’s proficiency for projecting price targets forward in
time:

“One of the most astonishing calculations made by Mr. Gann was
during last summer (1909) when he predicted that September Wheat
would sell at $1.20. This meant that it must touch that figure before the
end of the month of September. At twelve o'clock, Chicago time, on
September 30th (the last day) the option was selling below $1.08 and it
looked as though his prediction would not be fulfilled. Mr. Gann said,

‘Tfit does not touch $1.20 by the close of the market, it will prove that there

is something wrong with my whole method of calculations. I do not care

what the price is now, it must go there.’ It is common history that

September Wheat surprised the whole country by selling at $1.20 and no

higher in the very last hour of trading, closing at that figure.”

Gann’s trading methods are based on personal beliefs of a natural order
existing for everything in the universe. Gann was part of a family with strong
religious beliefs. As a result, Gann would often use Biblical passages as a basis
for not only his life, but his trading methods. A passage often quoted by Gann
was this from Ecclesiastes 1:9-10:

“What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done.
Nothing is new under the sun. Even the thing of which we say, ‘See, this
is new!’ has already existed in the ages that preceded us.”

This universal order of nature also existed, Gann determined, in the stock
and commodity markets. Price movements occurred, not in a random manner,
but in a manner that can be pre-determined. The predictable movements of
prices result from the influence of mathematical points of force found in nature.

These points of force were felt to cause prices to not only move, but move in
a manner that can be anticipated. Future targets for both price and time can be
confidently projected by reducing these mathematical points of force to terms of
mathematical equations and relationships.

The mathematical equations of Gann are not complex. They result in lines
of support and resistance which prices invariably will follow. The intersection
of these lines of force, called Gann Lines (See “Gann Angles - Price versus Time”)
can pinpoint when a price reaction will occur, while others will reflect at what
level price reactions will occur.

Charts 1 and 2 illustrate using Gann methods to determine the “when” and
“at what price” of market activity.
Chart 1 illustrates the “when” of price reactions. The chart is of the
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index contract for June 1988. The time period
is from 10/26/87 to 2/1/88. Keep in mind that these prices occurred after the
infamous “Black Monday” of 10/19/87.

Letters “P,” “J,” “I” and “M” appear above or below some price bars in Chart
1 and others in this book. These letters indicate Primary, Major, Intermediate
and Minor Gann Pivot Points, generated by the software. These Gann pivots are
included on some charts only as an easy reference to designate certain days.
They are not needed for plotting Gann’s 50% Retracement Zones. (See Appendix
D for a further explanation of Gann Pivot Points.)

Computerized positive and negative 1x1, 2x1, and 4x1 Gann Lines have
been drawn on Chart 1. The negative Gann Lines appear in parentheses.

Some line intersections have been circled. It is not a coincidence that price-
reactions occur within one day on either side of the lines’ intersections. The more
of a particular type of lines that intersect on a particular day, the stronger the
price reaction. These intersections should give you the “when” of price reactions.

Chart 2 is the same chart as Chart 1. 1/5/89 (the Primary - “P” - Gann Pivot
Point day) has been circled. The computerized Gann Lines appearing are those
which the software has determined will most affect price activity on that day.

The high of that day is 26560. A computerized 4x1 line (“a”), drawn from the
high of 25700 on “I” day of 1 2/23/87, intersects 1/5/89 at a price level of 26564, only
4 points over the high of 1/5/89.

The 1x4 line (“b”), drawn from the high of 26300 on the “M” day of 10/30/87,
intersects 1/5/89 at a price level of 26641, 81 points over the high of the day.

It is not a coincidence that the high of 1/5/89 falls between 26564 (“a”
intersection with 1/5/89) and 26641 (“b” intersection with 1/5/89).

These are greatly over-simplified illustrations of the Gann-Line theory. For
our purposes, though, Charts 1 and 2 show that combinations of multiple Gann
Lines can accurately project price turning points for any given day.

Even after a financial shock such as “Black Monday,” the inter-relationships
and effects of Gann Lines still hold true.

Gann Lines result from mathematical expressions that have two elements.

These two elements are PRICE and TIME.

TIME

Gann held that time is the most important element of trading. Time is the
factor that determines the length of a commodity’s price trend. When time
dictates that trending prices should react, prices may stabilize for a short period,
or they may fluctuate within a tight range, but eventually they will react by
reversing direction. Time is the element that will determine WHEN prices
should react.

Certain price reactions are found to occur during specific times. The actual
TYPE of price reaction can be anticipated, and pre-determined, by using Gann
time rules.

Gann time periods last not only days or weeks, but months and even years.
Gann Angles (these are discussed in the section, “Gann Angles”) that affect
prices in December could very well have started in the previous January.

Gann’s trading year is first divided in half, equivalent to 6 months or 26
weeks. The year is then divided into quarters, totalling 13 weeks or 90 days. The
year is then still further divided by eighths, and then by sixteenths. And then,
after you think you understand all of this, you find that Gann’s year is also
divided by thirds.

There are also important time PERIODS within the Gann year. For
example, since a week is 7 days, and 7 times 7 is 49, Gann’s work found that 49
is a significant number. Important tops or bottoms may occur between the 49th
and 52nd day, although an intermediate change-in-trend may occur between the
42nd and 45th day, because 45 daysis1/8 ofa year (Note: this is outlined in “How
To Make Profits In Commodities” by W. D. Gann, on page 57).

Other time periods that were important to Gann, at which a price reaction
could be expected, are:

e Anniversary dates of major tops and bottoms.

¢ 7 months after a major top or bottom for a minor reaction.

¢ 10to014 days is the length for a reaction in a normal market. If this

period is exceeded, the next reaction should be expected after 28 to
30 days.

If you're not already confused, understand that Gann’s year may not only be
calendar, but “fiscal” as well; i.e., starting from major tops or bottoms. Gann’s
time rules consider many periods, including seasonality, Biblical references, and
astronomical events.
Chart 3 is an example of astronomical correlations on aGann chart. One of
Gann’s beliefs, stemming from his “natural order’ concept, is the influence of
planetary movements on earthly events, such as the moon’s perceived effect on
tides. This “cosmic perspective” of Gann is unlike conventional astrology, in that
planetary influences, like units of price, are unique to each market.

Chart 3 was prepared by Genesis Capital’s Director of Research, Gregory L.
Meadors. Mr. Meadors is a technician with 20 years of experience in this highly

specialized field of Gann analysis.

PRICE

While Gann’s theories of time dealt with WHEN prices will move, his
theories of price determine HOW MUCH prices will move.

Gann’s price theories deal with percentages. They may be a little easier to
understand and use than Gann’s time theories.

Price is divided into segments called ranges. Gann’s price ranges, like his
time periods, are defined on a basis of periodic highs and lows. These periods
could be on an intra-day, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or life-of-contract basis,
depending on how large a period youre analyzing.

Significant price ranges do not require an entire calendar year to occur. The
PRICE LEVEL rather than the actual DATE ofa major high or lowis important.
An annual high could occur on January 1, and 30 days later a drastic low could
occur. Prices may move between these two limits for the rest of the calendar year.
The annual high and low then, which established the price range for the rest of
the calendar year, would only be 30 days apart.

The price ranges, regardless of the time required for them to occur, are
divided by eighths and also by thirds, and are defined in terms of percentages of
the previous price trend. For example, the price level ofa small price range can
be at the 50% level. However, the same price level ofa LARGER price range may
only be at the 25% level of the larger range.

Table 1 lists Gann’s price levels and their percentages, within a range.

Gann Price Levels

Each 1/8 and 1/3 price level in a price range offers different degrees of
support and resistance to further price movements. (This theory of support and
resistance will be further explained in the section, “Gann’s 50% Retracement
Rule.”)

The 1/8- or 3/8-level ofa price range may offer such little resistance (to rising
prices) or support (to falling prices), that, on an intraday chart, a price reaction
may hardly be noticeable.

However, on the same intraday chart, once prices reach the 50% or 100%
retracement level ofa previous trend, the amount of resistance or support - or the
lack of it - may be dramatic.

These price reactions, and their respective percentages, are known as

retracements.

12

RETRACEMENTS

One area of Gann’s price rules deals with retracements.

A retracement is a price reversal from the direction of the current price
trend, occurring before prices continue in the original direction.

50%, 75%, and 100% price retracement levels, and their multiples, offer the
strongest levels of price support or resistance to further price movements.
Reactions at and from the 50% level, which Gann called the “balancing point,”
should occur most often.

Chart 4 is a diagram of retracements. Prices begin to fall from12 units. At
2 units, prices reverse direction to the upside. They continue rising until
reaching a level of 50% OF THE PREVIOUS MAJOR PRICE TREND, or 7 units.

At 7 units, prices react 50% of the distance from 2 to 7 units, before
continuing the upward trend. The upward trend continues to 9-1/2 units, or 75%
of the 12-to-2 bear price trend.

At 9-1/2, again, prices react 50% to the downside before continuing the
upward trend to the 100% level - 12 units - of the previous bear move.

13
Chart 5 is a price chart of the June 1988 contract for the S&P 500. Itis the
same contract and time period as that of Charts 1 and 2, but without Gann Pivot
Points. Prices can be seen to trend for a period of time, and then react at the Gann
levels of 50%, 63%, 75%, and 100%. Reaction points are labelled “A” through “M.”

Chart 5 is divided into 4 Price Ranges. These ranges are shown on Charts
6, 7,8 and 9. As you review these charts, you'll notice that:

1) Prices retrace to Gann retracement levels, and then react.

2) Evenifintraday prices exceed a Gann retracement level, prices generally

will close within an acceptable Retracement Zone.

3) In some cases, prices react almost to the exact midpoint of the daily price

range.

Gann stated that when 2 or more 50% Retracement Zones occur at the
same price level, congestion occurs. Prices don’t know whether to react
to the “bearishness” of Range 2 or the “bullishness” of Range 3.
Therefore - congestion. (Another example of this can be seen in a T-
Bond chart in the section, “Fine Tuning the 50% Rule.”)

Point K - Price range of 1/15/89; 50% Retracement of the previous 50%
retracement.

Prices met with very strong resistance in the 10-point zone of 24190 to
24200. After 3 attempts, prices rebounded to the upside, but only to ap-
proximately 50% of the previous move from Point I to Point J.

Therefore, the NEW limits for Range 4 should be:

OK, maybe you'll say that I researched thousands of charts to find just the
right one to use. If that were true, and Gann’s rules of retracements are not
universally valid, then Chart 10 could not exist.

Chart 10 is a phenomenal example of Gann’s 100% Retracement Rule. The
chart, from Commodity Trend Service, is of the weekly S&P 500 Index.

The time period is about 3 years - July 1986 to April 1989. The high for that
period is 33945, and the lowis 14726. Many price reactions occur at Gann’s 50%,
63% and 75% price levels.

The historic price collapse in October 1987 - “Black Monday” - can be clearly
seen. This occurred almost to the exact date and price tick OF TWO YEARS
PRIOR to “Black Monday.”

Was Gann right?

If you consider the “life-of-the-commodity” price range for a commodity
that’s been traded since Gann’s time, such as Wheat, it is not hard to imagine
having eighth levels, divided by eighth levels, divided by thirds, divided by...

Gann held that it was better to make only several excellent trades a year,
rather than a number of fair ones. To do this, a yearly price chart would have to
be reviewed to determine in which year prices tend to “peak” or “bottom.” Then,
a monthly chart is used to determine in which month of which year prices will
turn. Narrowing turning points even further, weekly and finally daily charts are
used. Using only daily charts will cloud “. . . the big picture.”

Let’s assume for a moment that you have a commercially - available chart,
such as Chart 10. You’ve located a major high and a major low. You notice that
prices are starting a bull move from the major low and have counted over 45 days,
expecting a reaction to occur at that time.

How do you know if the major high that you’ve located IS actually a major
high, or merely a minor reaction in a larger bear market? Could the 4/8 level of
that evolving bull market be only the 1/3 level of a larger bear reaction? And
assuming you ARE right about the 4/8 level, what do you do now? (Don’t give up
now! It get’s easier from here.)

Gann’s system establishes order out of chaos. Gann angles and the
associated geometric angles form a unique system for projecting price and time
targets. Books have been written and seminars given on Gann’s theories. A
complete explanation of Gann’s trading theories is well beyond that which is
written here. Mastering all of his concepts is difficult, taking years of practice
and study, if it can be done at all.

Gann’s 50% Retracement Rule, and the rules taught here, are the exception.

But before presenting a clear and effective way to use Gann’s 50% Retrace-
ment Rule, the difference between Gann Angles and geometric angles must be
explained.

28
GANN ANGLES - PRICE VERSUS TIME

Gann established a relationship between units of price and units of time.

He used several styles of charts, including the conventional “X-Y” axis chart
that is used today. Price is plotted on the “Y” axis, and time is plotted on the “X”
axis. Gann died in 1955. Not having a computer, he used 8x8 graph paper (eight
squares to the inch) to chart prices. The 8x8 graph paper allowed him to
“balance” units of price with units of time.

Units of PRICE are unique for each commodity. A one-inch price movement
on a chart for Treasury Bonds may equal 64 points. However, for the S&P 500
Index, this same one-inch distance may equal 100 points. It is the number of
points on the chart, not the actual chart distance, which defines a unit of price,
for purposes of establishing Gann angles.

Units of TIME are standard for all commodities. One minute, one hour, one
day, one week, or one month are the same for the Gold, Pork Bellies, S&P 500
Index, Treasury Bonds or Corn markets.

By graphing “Y” units of price, moving in “X” units of time, Gann originated
his Gann Angles. Gann Angles are written in the algebraic expression of “PxT,”
where “P” equals units of price and “T” equals units of time.

Gann Angles define price movements, by relating units of price to units of
time. Each Gann Angle represents a relationship between price and time. The
relationship between MANY Gann Angles, drawn from significant tops and
bottoms, intersecting with each other and trading days, can not only determine
WHEN prices will react, but AT WHAT PRICE that reaction will occur - a
harmonious blend of price versus time.

The basic ratio of Gann Angles is 1:1 - one unit of price equalling one unit
of time. The resulting “1x1” Gann Angle reflects that prices are moving one unit
of price in one unit of time. A “2x1” Gann Angle indicates that prices are moving
TWO units of price in one unit of time. A “1x2” Gann Angle indicates that prices
are moving one unit of price, but in TWO units of time.

Assuming prices are rising, prices following a 2x1 Gann Angle are rising
faster than prices following a 1x1 Gann Angle. A1lx2 Gann Angle would indicate
the slowest of all 3 rates of price rise. Prices falling at a 2x1 Gann Angle are
falling at a faster rate than at a 1x1 or 1x2 Gann Angle.

Table 2 expands on Table 1, by listing 7 Gann levels, with their correspond-
ing percentages, degrees and Gann Angles:

29
Gann Price Levels
Percentages, Degrees, Gann Angles, Support/Resistance

Table 2
Level Percentage Degree Gann Angle Support/Resistance

1/8 12-1/2 14 1x4 Support +

2/8 25 26-1/2 1x2 Support +

4/8 50 45 1x1 Neutral

5/8 62-1/2 63-1/2 2x1 Resistance +

6/8 75 75 4x1 Resistance +

7/8 87-1/2 82-1/2 8x1 Resistance +

8/8 100 90 — Resistance +

Assumes a Rising Market; Reverse for Falling Market

Unlike geometric angles, Gann Angles are NOT the same for all markets.
A 45-degree GEOMETRIC angle is not equal to a 1x1 GANN Angle for all
markets. A 1x1 GANN Angle is not at the same GEOMETRIC angle for ALL
marketsin ALL time frames. GANN’s system was designed to reflect the unique
nature of EACH market’s price activity in relationship to time.

GEOMETRIC angles represent each of Gann’s eighth-levels of price activity,
independent of time. While some relationship may exist between movements of
price units per unit of time by using geometric angles, the relationship is not
constant for ALL commodities in ALL time periods, or for ALL chart scales.

Gann found prices will react in a unique way when following his Gann
Angles, designated as “Support/Resistance” in Table 3. If prices begin to rise (a
bull trend) from a significant low, they will follow a base angle of 1x1, or 45-
degrees, for most of the trend. As a change-in-trend starts to occur, the trend’s
angle for prices may increase to 63-1/2 degrees, 75 degrees, and 82-1/2 degrees
(see Chart 54).

Should prices “break” the 45-degree line, they will find support along a 26-
1/2 degree line. Should that line be broken, the last “line of defense” before prices
collapse will be along a 14-degree line. Gann was so confident that a change in
trend was about to evolve after prices closed under a 45-degree line that he
termed it the “Death Line.”

Charts 11 and 12 illustrate Gann Angles, and their resulting geometric
angles, in relationship to chart scale.

30

Chart 11 illustrates the relationship between Gann and geometric angles
when units of price EQUAL units of time.

Each unit of price, and each unit of time, equals 1 inch.

When prices move ONE unit of price in TWO units of time, a 1x2 GANN
Angle, or a 26-1/2-degree GEOMETRIC angle, results.

When prices move ONE unit of price in ONE unit of time, a 1x1 GANN
Angle, or a 45-degree GEOMETRIC angle, results.

When prices move TWO units of price in ONE unit of time, a 2x1 GANN
Angle, or a 63-1/2-degree GEOMETRIC angle, results.

When prices move FOUR units of price in ONE unit of time, a 4x1 GANN
Angle, or a 75-degree GEOMETRIC angle, results.

B 1x1 45
C 2x1 63-1/2
D 4x1 75

32

Since each market has a unique price scale, or when either the price or time
scale of one market changes, the resulting GEOMETRIC angle of the GANN
Angle will change accordingly.

Chart 12 illustrates the relationship between Gann and geometric angles,
when units of price DO NOT EQUAL units of time. Units of time equal 1 inch.
However, units of PRICE now equal 1-1/4 inches.

When prices move ONE unit of price in TWO units of time, a 1x2 GANN
Angle still results, but now at a 32-degree GEOMETRIC angle.

When prices move ONE unit of price in ONE unit of time, alxl GANN Angle
still results, but now at a 51-degree GEOMETRIC angle.

When prices move TWO units of price in ONE unit of time, a 2x1 GANN
Angle still results, but now at a 68-degree GEOMETRIC angle.

When prices move FOUR units of price in ONE unit of time, a 4x1 GANN
Angle still results, but now at a 79-degree GEOMETRIC angle.

Charts 13, 14 and 15 are real-time examples of Gann and geometric angles.
All 3 charts are ofthe June 1989 S&P 500 Index contract. Computerized 1x1
and 1x2 Gann Angles, and a 45-degree geometric angle, have been drawn on all
3 charts. The three lines begin from 26380, the low of 8/22/88, a Primary Gann
Pivot Point day.

Each chart has a different time period and/or price range.

Chart 13 is for the time period of 9/1/88 to 12/30/88. The price scale is from
a low of 26220 to 30360. This is the range defaulted by the software.

The 1x1 Gann Line intersects the price trend on 9/1/88 (a Minor Gann Pivot
Point day), at 26632.

The 1x1 Gann Line is at a geometric angle of 33 degrees.
The 1x2 Gann Line is at a geometric angle of 18 degrees.

Chart 14 has the same time period as that of Chart 13. The price range has
been changed. The new rangeis from a low of 26240 toa high of 29440. The result
is that the PRICE SCALE of the chart has changed.

The 1x1 Gann Line still intersects the price range at the same point, 26632
on 9/1/88, as it did in Chart 13. The 45-degree GEOMETRIC angle is still the
same as that of Chart 13.

Itis clear that the Gann Angles of Chart 6 are not at the same GEOMETRIC
angles as those geometric angles of Chart 13.

The 1x1 Gann Line is now at a geometric angle of 40 degrees.

The 1x2 Gann Line is now at a geometric angle of 22 degrees.

In Chart 15, both the time period AND the price range have changed from
those of Chart 13. This alters the chart SCALES for both PRICE AND TIME.

The time period is from 6/17/88 to 10/31/88.

The price scale is from a low of 26220 to a high of 29440.

The 1x1 line, as in Charts 13 and 14, intersects the price trend at the low
of 26632 on 9/1/88. The GEOMETRIC 45-degree line is still the same as that of
Charts 13 and 14.

However, the GEOMETRIC angles of the 1x1 and 1x2 lines have again
changed.

The 1x1 Gann Line is now at a geometric angle of 32 degrees.

The 1x2 Gann Line is now at a geometric angle of 17 degrees.

GANN’S 50% RETRACEMENT RULE

The 50% Retracement Rule, based on Gann’s 50% and 62-1/2% price levels,
is this:

GANN’S 50% RETRACEMENT RULE

AFTERAN INITIAL, SUSTAINED PRICE MOVE,
EITHER UP OR DOWN, PRICES RETRACE TO
50% (4/8) OF THEIR INITIAL MOVE. IF THE
RETRACEMENT EXCEEDS 50%, PRICES
SHOULD CONTINUE TO THE 62-1/2% (5/8)
LEVEL, BEFORE A REACTION OCCURS.

When prices begin to rise or fall, the most-important level at which some
price reaction should occur will be the 50% level. For example, if prices have
fallen from $2.00 to $1.00, and begin to rise, the strongest level of resistance to
further price advancement should be expected at the $1.50 level.

The next important level is the 62-1/2% level. Again using the above
example, if prices continue rising past the $1.50 level, the next level of resistance
should be at approximately $1.63.

If prices continue past the 62-1/2% level, the third-strongest level of price
resistance should be at the 100%, or $2.00, price level.

Just the opposite is true for prices that have been rising and are now
beginning to fall. Ifa bull trend occurs from $10.00 to $20.00, prices will decline
to $15.00 before reacting to the upside.

If prices continue to fall past $15.00, the next significant support level
should be at the 62-1/2% level of the original bull move, or at about $13.80. Again,
prices will react before continuing downward.

Of the 7 Gann levels listed in Table 2, the 50%, 62-1/2% and 100% levels are
the most significant, and correspond to GEOMETRIC angles of 45 degrees, 63
degrees, and 90 degrees. These are the ones that will be used for determining
Gann’s 50% Retracement Zone.

In addition, we will use 26 degrees (the inverse of 63 degrees) for “stops.”
(Gann actually used geometric angles of 26-1/2, 45 and 63-1/2 degrees, but the
1/2-degree is not critical.)

While the concept of using Gann Angles balances price and time, the
geometric angles of 26, 45 and 63 degrees will be used to determine price-only
movements. If Gann used these three angles, and met with success, then there
must be an inter-relationship between these angles, independent ofachart’s price
and time scale.

41

It is this relationship between the geometric angles, and not the individual
angles themselves, that is the basis for this exciting, simple method of following
Gann’s work.

Looking at the charts throughout this book, price ranges can be seen
starting from a low or a high, moving up.or down and, at some point, beginning
to retrace the original price move. After these retracements, the original price
trend continues. You see what will happen on Friday when it’s only Monday.
Hindsight is always better than foresight.

Actual trading isa little different. Only price activity that has occurred, and
that which is now occurring, can be seen. Evolving price activity may not always
be as clear, when only a part of “the big picture” is seen.

Remember, you are not dealing with something that is absolute. Commod-
ity trading deals with events that have not yet happened. For this reason, it
might be better to target a general “price zone” rather than just one number.
After that zone is reached, then you can “zero-in” to a single price target.

Ideally, to calculate the 50% retracement levels, a trader would only have
to select a range, subtract the low from the high of that range, divide by 2, and
add the quotient to the low or subtract it from the high.

But again, in dealing with events that WILL occur, rather than those that
HAVE occurred, it is important to be flexible in your thinking. Prices may not
always react to a single number, and may over- or under-shoot the 50% estimate.

Too, if you’re like me, math may not be your best subject. And did you ever
try to add or subtract 32nds for T-Bonds?

There must be a method by which you can estimate WHEN to place an order
and AT WHAT PRICE, without devoting years of study to Gann. Establishing
a “price zone” may be the answer.

But how big should that “price zone” be? Where should the stop-loss orders
be placed? (This is another Gann rule. NEVER trade without using “stops.”)
And how can you SEE when to get in, or when to get out of, a position?

Read on. “A picture is worth a thousand words.”

PART Il

Establishing a Retracement Zone

Look at Chart 16. This is the March 89 Deutschemark contract. The time
period is from 4/1/88 to 1/20/89. (The dotted line and crosses are trend and stop
signals from the G.E.T. software’s “Auto Mode;” they ARE NOT needed to
establish a Retracement Zone.)

There are 3 points that will have to be located - P1, P2, and P3.

The first point tolocateis P1, a significant high or low from which prices will
be moving. On the Deutschemark chart, prices are dropping from such a
significant high of 6247 on 4/18, an Intermediate Gann Pivot Point day.

The second point to determine is P2. This is a reaction point from which
prices will change direction from the previous trend, and move towards the 50%
Retracement Zone. For instance, if prices were falling from P1, they should now
be rising from P2, toward the anticipated 50% Retracement Zone. P2 on Chart
16 is the low at 5292 on 8/10 (a Primary Gann Pivot Point day).

The third point to locate is P3. (The coordinates for P3 are described on page
19, of “Definitions.”) The two coordinates that locate P3 on Chart 16 are the price
of P1, 6247, and the day of P2, 8/10. This point is marked by a “+.”

From P2 of 8/10, two lines are drawn up and to the right. LJ is drawn at an
angle of 63 degrees, and L2 is drawn at an angle of 45 degrees.

From P38, a third line, L3, is drawn down and to the right, and at an angle
of 45 degrees.

The two intersections of these three lines - L1, L2, and L3 - will identify the
upper (RZH) and lower (RZL) limits of Gann’s 50% Retracement Zone:

RZH_ -_ Li (upward 63-degree line from P2) crosses L3 (downward 45-

degree line from P38).
This is the 63% retracement level, and is 5932 on Chart 16.

47
RZL - L2 (upward 45-degree line from P2) crosses L3 (downward 45-
degree line from P3).
This is the 50% retracement level, and is 5771 on Chart 16.

Two horizontal lines (RZH and RZL) are drawn at the levels of 5932 and
5771, forming a price channel. The resulting 161-point channel with the limits
of 5932 and 5771 is the Retracement Zone, into which you can anticipate prices
will enter and react to the downside.

Notice that prices are rising toward the Retracement Zone, but in a choppy
pattern. Thisis due to many “50% retracements” occurring during the bull move
from the P2 low of 5292, while heading toward the Retracement Zone objective
of 5771 - 5932.

Prices close at 5782 0n 11/10. The price trend has entered the Retracement
Zone on a closing basis. Prices closing in the Retracement Zone is confirmation
that a change-in-trend MAY BE DUE, within the Retracement Zone. (Prices
could very well continue through the Retracement Zone, but a high probability
exists that they will react WITHIN the Retracement Zone.)

When prices close within the Retracement Zone, you should either liquidate
your position, or move up your “stops” to protect accumulating profits. But how?

PART IV

Stop-loss Orders

Stop-loss orders are used to protect profits and prevent excessive losses.

A basic stop order is an order which liquidates your position should the
market turn against it. The stop order becomes a market order when, and if, the
stop price equals the current market price.

In a bull (rising) market, the stop is placed BELOW the entry price. Bonds
seem to be rising. You decide to buy the market at 9516. A stop could be placed
at 9500, a risk of $500.

In a bear (falling) market, the stop is placed ABOVE the entry price. Bonds
now may be falling and you're short one contract at 9516. You want some
protection if the market reverses. A stop is placed at 9600, again a risk of $500.

There are different types of stop-loss orders such as the stop with limit
(which uses two prices), stop close only (a disaster if the market opens against
you, and continues against you throughout the day) and the stop limit close only
(even more of a disaster for anyone with less experience than a professional
trader).

WHERE to place the stop seems to be a question without an answer. Ifyou
use Elliott Waves, stops are placed several points above or below the start of
Waves 1, 3or5. J. Welles Wilder, Jr.’s Volatility System (reviewed in July 1989
“Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities” magazine) places stopsin relation
to previous days’ highs, lows and closes. For a newer trader, any method that
allows the trader to limit risk to a comfortable amount of money is fine.

The type of stop used should be a simple stop order. No magic, no frills, just
protection. Place your order and place your stop. If you are right, great! Your
stop will not be hit. If you’re wrong (and you will be!) and prices hit your stop,
you're out with minimum, pre-determined losses.

Establishing stops has always been more of an art thana science. There are
no universal rules that will cover setting stops for all markets in all market
situations.

50
As one trader said, “The distance that a stop is placed away from the market
is directly proportional to that trader’s tolerance for stress, pain and monetary
losses.”

One way of locating stops is by using trendlines, which usually connect two
or three non-consecutive lows (in a bull market), or highs (in a bear market).

Trendlines are used for establishing just that - market trends. Chart 17 is
of the March 1984 S&P 500 Index. Five trendlines - A, B, C, D and E - have been
drawn on the chart. When prices break the trendlines at points a, b, c, d and e,
it indicates that the trend is changing, and some type of action should be
considered by the trader.

Trendlines can also be used as a guide for estimating stop-loss prices. The
stopis placed at the intersection of the trendline and the current market day. But
there are two drawbacks to using trendlines for locating stops.

First, stops may be too far away from current market prices to offer
reasonable protection points. Points S1 and 82, marked with a “+” on trendlines
B and E, are examples of this.

S1 on Trendline B crosses 9/20/83 at 16873. The low for that day is 17205.
This equals a risk of 332 points, or $1660.

S2 on Trendline E crosses 1/10/84 at 16621. The low for that day is 16990.
This is risking a whopping 369 points, or $1945.

If the market were to reverse suddenly, would you be happy losing that
amount of capital from your account, or lost profits from your position?

Second, conventional trendlines are not responsive to the actual cyclic pulse
of the market. Some profits will be given back before market prices “catch up”
to trendline prices.

A way around this is to use Gann geometric angles to locate stops. Some of
the benefits are:

1) Only one point, instead of 2 or 3, must be used.

2) The point from which the angle is drawn is close to the Retracement

Zone.

3) Gann Angles have proven to be “market sensitive.”

A 1x1 Gann Angle, for instance, will not intersect prices at the same level
for all chart scales. However, the relationship between the 45-degree Gann
geometric angle, being used as a stop-loss line, and the Retracement Zone angles
will be the same.

This cannot be stressed enough. Your concern is THE PRICE RELATION-
SHIP BETWEEN WHERE YOU ENTERED THE MARKET AND THE STOP-
LOSS LINE, SUPPORTED BY OTHER INDICATORS. You are not looking to
enter or exit the market always at a specific point, but at ANY point that will be
profitable for you.

PART V

Liquidating in the Retracement Zone

When prices enter the Retracement Zone, consider at what price you may
want to liquidate your long position. This does not mean that you will HAVE to
liquidate your position, just because prices are in the Retracement Zone.

Just the opposite. Now is the time to insure current profits, and maximize
future profits. There are three ways in which this is done - by stop order, by
market order, or a combination of both.

53

Stop Order

The first way is by stop order.

Chart 18 is a “zoomed in” section of Chart 16. The time period is from 10/
24/88 to 12/29/88. The RZH and RZL of Chart 16 have been entered on the chart
as well as stop-loss lines S4 and S5, defined in Part II, “Definitions.” Rather than
connecting highs or lows, stop-loss lines $4 and S5 are drawn from minor highs
and lows, at one of four Gann geometric angles.

S4 is drawn from P3 at a 26-degree angle (this is actually the inverse of 63
degrees). This will be an initial stop-loss line should a short position be taken
after prices react to the downside from the area of the Retracement Zone High.

In order to “let profits run,” S5 is drawn from a minor low or high reaction
point. This will be a point from which prices will trend into the Retracement
Zone. Such a point is on 11/4, at a low of 5633 (a minor Gann Pivot Point).

The Gann angle for S5 will be determined by using a protractor. This angle
will usually be 63 or 75 degrees. In a slow market, it may be 45 degrees and in
a fast market, 82 degrees. S5 should not be too “tight” for the specific price range.
Prices need room to “move.” In Chart 18, $5 is 63 degrees from 5633 on 11/4.

Each day, continue moving your stop-loss order up, along the stop-loss line
from 5633, until the stop-loss order is filled. This is in consonance with the
trading axiom of “letting the market tell you what to do.”

On November 25, the day ends with a lower high and a lower low than on
the previous day. The stop for the following trading day, November 28, would be
at 5845, the S5 level for 11/25. Your position would have been stopped out, with
handsome profits, on the opening of 11/28 at 5820.

Close-only, rather than intraday, stops could be used to eliminate intraday
price fluctuations. Some technicians feel that closing prices reflect the “truer”
trend of the market. (I wonder how many “close-only” stops were in place on
“Black Monday?”)

Intraday stops are safer in that you know where your position will be
liquidated. Some profits may be cut short using intraday stops. You would
benefit, though, by having your cash in the account rather than in the market.

Each day, as prices continue to trend through the 50% Retracement Zone,
move your stop-loss order up along the S5 line, to the price level of the
CURRENT, or PREVIOUS, day.

If you don’t “feel right” about the market, or are satisfied with your profits,
use the S5 price level of the CURRENT day. Intraday price-reactions, though,
may limit your profits and “stop you out” prematurely.

If you're confident of the trend continuing and want to allow for some
market “vibrations,” use the S5 price level of the PREVIOUS day. However,
should a sudden reversal occur, some profits may be lost.

54

Using the current, or previous, day S5 price level for stops is a personal
choice.

55
Market Order

The second way is through market order. This method will turn points into
profits as soon as you call your broker. Your position will be liquidated at the best
price available.

Again using Chart 18 as an illustration, you may want to liquidate your
position when prices begin entering the upper area of the Retracement Zone.
Consider that the RZH of Chart 18 is 5932 and that the high of 11/23 (a Primary
Gann Pivot Point day) is 5910. You may feel comfortable with your profits and
think the market “cannot go” any higher.

On the next trading day, 11/25, the high was 5907. The 11/23 high of 5910
appears to be a significant high. Both highs are near the upper Retracement
Zone limit of 5932. You could have placed a market order on either day to
liquidate your position. This would have been somewhere around 5900.

Safety or maximum profits - the choice is yours.

56

Stop and Market Order

The RZH in Chart 18 is 5932. On11/10, prices close within the Retracement
Zone at 5782.

Remember, you are dealing with the future - something that can be
anticipated but not verified. There’s no guarantee on 11/10 that prices will trend
exactly to 5932 and then reverse. They could very well continue past 5932 to the
75% or even the 100% level.

But let’s say, for whatever reason, you want to liquidate your current
position. This could be the way to do it.

11/4 could be a minor reaction point from which S5 (63-degrees) can be
drawn. S65 is the resulting stop-loss line. Place a “day-only” order with your
broker to sell your position at the RZH price of 5771.

Every day move your stop-loss order up along S5 to the previous day’s level
and replace your day-only sell order of 5771. If you get 5771, fine. If you don’t,
you still have the added protection of a stop being moved closer and closer to
current market prices. You are establishing a narrower and narrower price
channel.

Safety AND maximum profits - when handled correctly these stops can be
very worthwhile.

PART VI

After Profits ... Now What?

From mid-August to mid-November, you’ve participated in the American
dream - buy low and sell high. Quite a substantial profit has been realized. If,
by some means (there’s a suggestion in Part VII), a position was taken around
5300 and liquidated at about 5900, even with several trading “ins-and-outs”
along the way, your net profit, per contract, would have been about $6600.

What to do now? Sell high and buy back low. Thisis taking a “short” position
in the market.

As a new trader, you may be skeptical of “shorting the market.” Selling
short involves “borrowing” a contract, selling that contract at a high price in
anticipation of prices falling, and then buying it back later at a lower price. The
difference is your profit.

Selling something you don’t own may not sound right, but it’s done legally
many times a day. Short selling can be compared to a promise to pay for
something in the future for its use today. In commodities, an amount of margin
must be committed, even though you don’t “own” the contract.

Again referring to Chart 18, to short the 3/89 Deutschemark contract, you
again have two choices.

The first choice is to short the market on a “stop-and-reverse” trading
strategy. A stop-loss order for 5845 (the S5 price for 11/25) is in place for the
market on November 28. A “day-only,” “stop-and-reverse” order is placed with
your broker. These instructions tell your broker that, for 11/28 ONLY and IF
your stop-loss order is filled, you want to automatically short the market. The
“day only” part of the order will prevent an incorrect stop from being in place for
the following day.

On 11/28, your stop loss order of 5845 is filled and you are automatically
short one March Deutschemark contract.

A stop-loss order will also have to be placed to protect your new position from
a sudden reversal. The stop is placed at 5942, the price at which S4 intersects
the PREVIOUS trading day of 11/25.

59
REMEMBER: PLACE ANOTHER “STOP-LOSS” ORDER FOR THE
FOLLOWING DAY. NEVERTRADE WITHOUT STOPS!

The “stop-and-reverse” method works well in trending markets butinvolves
increased risks of being “whipsawed” in congestion areas. By using it, though,
you would have caught the bear move at a very high point.

The second way is to wait for a confirmed RZ exit point. This way of shorting
the market may be a little safer. While prices are in the Retracement Zone, they
could “bounce around” between the RZH and RZL, causing headaches and
sleepless nights.

Wait until prices CLOSE below the RZL of 5771. There is increased
confidence of a bear market evolving when this happens. Prices may still re-
enter the Retracement Zone from the downside, but the bear trend should
resume after this minor reaction. In any event, S4, from P3 of 6247, would
prevent any excessive losses should prices “whipsaw” in a bull reversal.

The example of the March 89 Deutschemark contract uses the extreme high
and low for a four-month period. The resulting Retracement Zone is unusually
wide. Most markets may not trend for such an extended period of time, over such
a broad price range.

A narrower high-low range, over a shorter period of time, should result in
a smaller, more-specific Retracement Zone. A smaller trading range, though,
may not have such a well-defined reaction as the wide Retracement Zone
illustrated in Chart 16.

This is another Gann rule: the wider the price spread and the longer the
time, the more definite the reaction.

By the way, consider this:

High of 4/18 6247
Low of 8/10 - 5292
Difference 955
50% of 955 478
Low of 8/10 + 5292
50% Retracement Target 5770
63% of 955 601
Low of 8/10 + 5292
63% Retracement Target 5893
Close of 11/22 5894!
Maybe Gann WAS right!

PART VII

Fine Tuning the 50% Rule

Refer back to Chart 16, the D-Mark chart.

You may feel that 3-1/2 months is too long to hold a position, even in
anticipation of a sizeable profit. This I understand. While you're waiting for
profits in November, you’ve sweated bullets over each and every reversal, and
felt you’ve missed buying opportunities.

Well, maybe you have, and maybe you haven’t. Gann stated that it was
much better to wait for an optimum trading opportunity, ADD TO positions at
reaction points and HOLD for the long term, rather than buy and sell, buy and
sell, buy and sell.

Using the information you’ve just learned, it is evident that at least 3
different 50% reaction points occurred from August to November at which you
could have followed Gann’s advice.

This was an exemplary chart. There was a very clear significant high, a
significant low, and a retracement point. But what about a market that has a lot
of peaks and valleys? Can this be done in a bear AND bull market?

Chart 19 is the March 89 T-Bond contract from 4/4/88 to 1/20/89. This is a
real roller-coaster ride, over which fortunes were probably made and lost. Ihave
“zoomed in” to a time period of 4/4/88 to 9/1/88. This is Chart 20.

The first significant high of Chart 20 is 8808 on 4/11, an Intermediate Gann
Pivot Point day and P1. There are reactions at several support levels, but prices
eventually reach a P2 significant low of 8223 on 5/22. The Retracement Zone is
calculated to be RZH = 8612 and RZL = 8510. From the low of 8226 on 5/31, a
75-degree stop-loss line, S5, is drawn.

On 6/6, the close is 8518 - in the Retracement Zone. On 6/7, asmall reaction
occurs, with prices closing below the RZL at 8504. With a stop for 6/7 at 8408 (the
price at which S5 crosses 6/6), the small reaction does not stop out the position
prematurely. S5 maintained the long position. In fact, if you had allowed this
stop-loss line to determine where to liquidate your position, you would have
netted another 55 points or so (about $1700).

Prices continue through the RZH level and make another significant high
of 8802 on 6/14.

The significant high of 8802 on 6/14 (a Primary Gann Pivot Point) is within
only 6 points of the previous significant high on 4/11 at 8808. This is not a
coincidence. Gann determined that a 50% or 100% level from any top or bottom
are the two most important points to watch in determining resistance levels.
Regardless of how long it would have taken, the 100% retracement level would
have been a realistic target.

The actual retracement amount of this real-time example is 97-1/2%!

Chart 21 covers the next price range we will consider. Pl is 8223 on 5/22
(a Primary Gann Pivot Point). P2 is 8802 on 6/14 (another Primary Gann Pivot
Point). P3 is at 8223 on 6/14. The resulting RZH is 8510 and the RZL is 8412.
After confirming that 6/14 is a significant high, a 75-degree stop-loss line is
drawn from 8718, the high of 6/15.

Sure enough. Prices drop into the pre-determined Retracement Zone, from
8802 on 6/14 to alow of 8418 on 6/20. Prices then react sharply to the upside. The
market could have been shorted with confidence at about 8612 on 6/15, after
6/14 was confirmed as a significant high. Continue moving stops down, as prices
enter the Retracement Zone.

Once prices were in the Retracement Zone, you would have had two choices
of how to exit the position. The first would have been to hold the position until
being stopped out at about 8500 on 6/21 (the 75-degree stop-loss line intersecting
the price trend).

The second way would have been to place a market order to cover your
shorts at 8427 or lower. Either way, the position would have resulted in profits
that would let you take your wife or husband out to dinner, AND a Broadway
show, AND pay off your VISA bill (maybe).

Notice I suggested liquidating at “... 8427 or lower... .” There is an
excellent chance of prices reacting at or near the midpoint (50%) of a Retrace-
ment Zone. The Retracement Zone’s midpoint of Chart 21 is 8427. In fact, on 6/
20 prices opened at 8424 and dropped to a low of 8418, only 9 points below the
midpoint.

Look at Chart 22. The Retracement Zone from Chart 21 is drawn in. Draw
in the 50% Retracement Zone of P1 at 8223 on 5/22 (a Primary Gann Pivot Point)
and P2 at 8723 on 7/1 (an Intermediate Gann Pivot Point). This is easily done
with a protractor. Draw this second Retracement Zone in red to help you
distinguish between the two Retracement Zones.

The Retracement Zone that you drew should have a RZH of 8504 anda RZL
of 8409. In this zone, notice that there is a lot of congestion.

Gann stated that, when two or more Retracement Zones occur near the
same level (8510-8512 and 8504-8509), the midpoint of the ranges will often be
the support point of a price decline or a resistance point of a price rally.

8431 is the approximate 50% midpoint level for both Retracement Zones
and avery strong reaction level. Prices seem to oscillate around this 8431 level.
It is not until 8/2 that prices gap to the upside by opening at 8515. There is
increased confidence that prices will trend past the Retracement Zone limits
when gaps occur.

Even though prices have gapped to the upside on 8/2, you may not want to
take a long position. Chart 23 is still the March 89 T-Bonds contract, but with
the long-term Elliott-Wave count on the bar chart and the short-term wave count
below the bar chart. If you’re familiar with Elliott, this is a blessing!

On 8/2 and 8/3, prices seem to be completing a minor C wave of a major B
wave to the upside. After that, prices fall dramatically.

What to do? Nothing, just wait. Wait until the minor C wave, of the major
B wave, is completed, and the major C wave is evolving from the 8/4 high of 8616
into a bear move, before taking a short position (Sources for Elliott Wave
information appear in Appendix D).

Up to now, we've been determining P1, P2, P3, S4, S5 and Retracement
Zones solely from price activity or sophisticated analysis systems such as Gann
or Elliott Waves.

Is there a simpler method a new trader can use? Some method or system
that is clear and gives supporting evidence for entry and exit points would be
ideal.

On to Part VIII.

PART VIII

A Word About Stochastics

Stochastics is a momentum indicator popularized by George C. Lane. An
Overview of stochastics is presented here, enough so even a beginner can use
stochastics. For more detail, a videotape instruction course is available from
Windsor Books.

Stochastic theory holds that during a bull trend, closing prices will be closer
to the top of the range than the bottom. Conversely, during a bear trend, closing
prices will be closer to the bottom of the range. When closing prices accumulate
toward either end of the price ranges, a change-in-trend usually occurs.

Stochastics use two values - %K and %D - to monitor how much “push” is in
a price trend and to indicate an evolving change-in-trend. %K is the actual
stochastic value, while %D is the 3-period average of %K.

The formula for stochastics is:

Close — 5 day low (WK + WK, + %K,)
= %K = %D
(5-day high) — (5-day low) 3

These values are charted on a scale from 0 to 100. The scale is divided into
3 sections - oversold, neutral and overbought.

The oversold range is from 0 to 20. When both stochastic values drop into
this range, it is an indication that too much of the market has been sold and that
buying could be anticipated. This will cause higher prices, with a resulting rise
in the stochastic values.

The range between 20 and 80 is aneutral range. Prices and stochastics will
generally react within this range, but may not result in major highs and lows, or
changes-in-trend. %K will reflect minor reactions while %D will reflect the
general trend. If there is doubt, my preference is to go with %D.

The overbought range is from 80 to 100. When both stochastic values enter
this range, itis an indication that too much of the market has been bought, prices

71
may have risen too high and profit-taking is occurring. Prices and stochastic
values should react to the downside.

There is only one valid signal, called divergence, for trading with stochas-
tics. Divergence occurs when prices are making new highs, but the stochastic
peaks are not. Even though prices are still rising, stochastics may be making
lower highs. This divergence suggests a bull-to-bear price reversal might be
expected.

When prices are making new lows or continue to fall, but the stochastic
valleys are “bottoming out” at a higher level, divergence suggests a bear-to-bull
reversal might be expected.

Stochastics are considered either “fast” or “slow,” depending on the number
of time periods used to calculate them. While a unique period for each market’s
stochastics could be determined, many chart services and software packages use
a single default setting of somewhere between 9 to 21 days, with either simple
or exponentially-weighted (greater values on current prices) values.

An exception to this is the G.E.T. software (listed in the Appendix), which
combines 2 time periods for stochastic charting. These time periods, A & B, are
weighted at 30% for A (the longer time period) and 70% for B (the shorter time
period).

Chart 24 is of the September 1989 Swiss Franc. G.E.T. stochastics were set
at the shorter, “faster” values of 14 periods for A, and 9 periods for B.

These shorter stochastic periods cause more up-and-down stochastic activ-
ity relative to actual price movements. More areas of divergence and changes-
in-trend (“over 80” and “below 20”) result. These “fast” stochastic signals, rather
than being significant, might only indicate minor reactions and cause constant
whipsaws, with more losses than gains in capital.

Chart 25 is also of the September 1989 Swiss Franc. G.E.T. stochastics are
set at the longer, “slower” settings of 21 periods for A, and 14 periods for B - those
defaulted by the software.

Compare Chart 25 with Chart 24. The longer periods of Chart 25 result in
smoother stochastics, with less divergence and stronger trading indicators.
Many of the stochastic “over-80” peaks of Chart 24 have been “rounded off’ while
many of the stochastic “under-20” valleys have been “filled in.” More interme-
diate or major turning points can be identified.

In Chart 25, only 2 technical signals are generated - shorting the market in
early December at about 7200 and again in late February at about 6600. The
trendlines from the two stochastic peaks are downward - the same as the overall
trend of the market.

Compare this to the stochastics of Chart 24, where stochastic trends rise
AND fall, even though the general price trend is down.

Two “rules of thumb” are popular for trading with stochastics. These occur
when %D and %K “cross over” each other, especially with values greater than 80
or less than 20.

When both 2K and %D values are rising, generally prices will also be rising.
When %K and %D values have “turned” to the downside, (risen above 80 from the
downside, crossed over each other, and are now falling below 80), the start ofa
bear trend could be expected, and the market could be sold.

When prices and stochastic values are falling and stochastics have “turned”
to the upside (fallen below 20 from the upside, crossed over each other, and are
now rising above 20), this may signal the start of a bull trend and the market
could be bought.

Keep in mind that there is a small glitch with stochastics. Stochastics is a
statistical, lagging, momentum indicator, rather than a strict price indicator.
The signals will result from the most-current price activity. The stochastic scale
though is limited to values between 0 and 100.

What happens is this. Often, prices will continue to rise or fall with greater
strength than stochastics can reflect. In this case, stochastics will bounce around
in the 0-20 or the 80-100 zone.

The same thing happens when you try to pour a gallon bucket of water
(prices), into a quart jar (0-100 stochastic scale). The jar (stochastics) will hold
only a “quart” of ®Ks and %Ds. The rest of the water (rising prices) will pour over
the sides of the jar. No matter how much water is poured into the jar, the water
will only come up to the top (100 on the stochastic scale). This causes divergence
- when prices continue to rise or fall, but stochastics do not.

The trick is to know HOW MUCH MORE WATER is in the price bucket
before the gallon bucket is empty (prices will reverse).

The G.E.T. Software minimizes this “gallon-of-water-into-a-quart-jar”
problem by using 2 “cycle-based,” weighted stochastics in one stochastic signal.
When the two stochastic signals do not simultaneously turn within the over-
bought or oversold zones, a solid bar appears above or below the stochastic signal.
The “how-much-water-is-left” problem is not solved, but there is less of it. (There
is no such thing as a “perfect” system or problem “cure-all” for futures trading.)

When the long- and short-term stochastics simultaneously “peak” or “bot-
tom,” a greatly-enhanced stochastic trading signal occurs. Stochastics is a fine
technical tool and should be used. The theory of stochastics is not changed by
G.E.T. - only the manner of generating stochastic signals.

16

Chart 26 is of the March ’89 T-Bonds contract with stochastics and Gann
Pivot Points. The solid, more erratic lineis %K. The smoother, dotted line is %D.

There is truly order here. By calculating the 50% Retracement Zones, and
using the supporting indicator of stochastics, trading could even become enjoy-
able.

Note the solid bars under and over some of the stochastic peaks and valleys,
especially for the period of September through November. These bars indicate
that the longer- and shorter-term stochastic signals have not synchronized for
that price area, and should be disregarded. Prices could be expected to continue
a rising or falling trend, even though stochastics turn down for a period.

But a person just starting to trade may not have software like G.E.T. What
to do? There is an answer.

Trying to use overbought or oversold stochastics for an extended period of
time creates “whipsaw” situations. You’re buying when you should sell and
selling when you should buy. Chart 27 is of the March 1989 T-Bond contract and
is a good example of this.

When stochastic trends differ from price trends, the benefit of stochastics
is minimized. Between September 5 and November 7, the stochastics of Chart
27 generally remain overbought (Line A) for the entire period, with the exception
of asmall drop during the week of September 26. Even then, prices are confined
by the 45-degree line, Line B, from the significant low of 8220 on August16. The
result is divergence between Line A and Line B.

On a daily chart like this, stochastics have little value. Unless you can
project prices with either Gann, Fibonacci or Elliott Wave techniques during this
period, and assuming you’re long the Bonds from mid-August, there may be little
value in using stochastics as a technical indicator.

But, just in case Bonds do fall, a target Retracement Zone has been plotted.
The RZH is 8624 and the RZL is 8512.

Recall that on page 22, one of Gann’s techniques in pinpointing changes-in-
trends was to start with a yearly chart to locate a general change-in-trend price
or time zone. Then a weekly chartis used in the same way, and then a daily chart.
We can do the same.

Chart 28 is the nearest-contract weekly chart for T-Bonds. Recall that on
Chart 27, stochastics are overbought on about September 5. Yet, on the weekly
chart, at about the same late-August-early-September time period (Point 1),
stochastics are just beginning to rise from an oversold area. Prices and
stochastics continue to rise into late October, when prices reach approximately
9100. %K then turns sharply down.

If, for whatever reason, you suspect stochastics are diverging from price on
a daily chart, always check the monthly chart. The monthly chart will give you
a larger view of price trends and activity, supported by stochastics.

On the weekly chart, Chart 28, Point 2 approximates to the week of October
31, the high of that week being 9028. Compare this time period to the same one
on Chart 27.

While you’re looking at Chart 28, plot two Retracement Zones.

Zone 1: P1 is the mid-October, 1988 low at about 7600.
P2 is the late-February 1988, first high, at just under 9600.

Zone 2: P1 is the late-February, 1988 second high at just under 9600.
P2 is the early-August low at 8400 (Point “-1-.”)

Plot one Retracement Zone in red and the second Retracement Zone in blue.
Pay special attention to the resulting price turning points and price actions, the
associated stochastic level, and any stochastic divergence just before prices turn
upward.

Compare the price and stochastic action of the weekly chart to the upcoming
daily chart, Chart 29.

Chart 29 shows that stochastics, like prices, sometimes have trendlines.
%K stochastics have peaked three times - September 14, October 10 and
November 1. During this time stochastics have been divergent from prices,
indicating an evolving change-in-trend. Trendline “A” connects the approximate
stochastic highs.

On November 4, prices drop from a high of 9028 to a low of 8904. On the
same day, %K and %D turn downward and break 75.

On November 7, prices open and close under the 45-degree line (Line B),
drawn from the August 16 significant low of 8220. By this time, six signals
suggest a short position:

1) 3 stochastic peaks.

2) Stochastics divergent from price.

3) Stochastic Line C being broken to the downside.

4) Price Line B (45-degrees) being broken to the downside.

5) Onthe monthly T-Bonds chart:

A) Prices are at the mid-point of the Retracement Zone of
P1 = “-1-” and P2 = “-2-,” and

B) Stochastic %K has peaked and is turning down. After the following
week, stochastics will cross.

Using 8220 on August 16 as Pl, and 9028 on November 3 as P2, a
Retracement Zone results with a RZH of 8622 and RZL of 8512.

Prices and stochastics continue to fall along L1 until November 27 to a low
of, you guessed it, 8621. This is only 1 point away from the 50% RZH of 8622.

Prices close above L1 the next day (in this example, prices trend along L1
so closely that L1 could be considered S4 as well). Stochastics begin to turn up
on November 28 and cross 25 to the upside on November 30. %D is in a definite
uptrend as well, as prices show another nice move through December 12.

Using the daily AND weekly price and stochastics charts would have
resulted in a profitable 4-month period. The up move from mid-August to late-
October was about 230 points or about $7000. The November down move would
have netted approximately another $3000. Merry Christmas!

Chart 30 is a section of Chart 26. The time period is from 5/13 to 8/18/88.

Prices begin to rise, starting on a Primary Gann Pivot Point day of 5/23 from
the day’s low of 8218. By definition, this is P1.

G.E.T. stochastics fail to give a strong indicator until 6/6. But then,
stochastics are entering the over-80 area and give no clear indicator for future
price direction. Stand aside for now.

Another Gann Primary Pivot Point registers for 6/12 at a high of 8802.
Again, by definition, this point will qualify as P2 for a Retracement Zone. P3 is
on 6/12 at the 8218 level. The RZH is 8508 and the RZL is 8413.

On 6/17, stochastics have crossed and fallen below 80. Prices are falling as
_ well toward the Retracement Zone. As both stochastic values fall below 80, a
short position could be taken. But remember, this is only a signal to enter the
market. There is no guarantee of how long, or how far, prices will fall. A
stochastic drop from 80 to 20 may equal a price drop of 10, 100, or 1000 points.

S5 is drawn from P2 at a 75-degree angle. A 63-degree angle appears to be
too “loose” for the price trend.

Price closes above S5, at 8503, on 6/20. This is above 8426, the midpoint of
the Retracement Zone. These two indicators suggest a long position at the
opening of 6/19 with a stop at 8412, 1 point below the RZL.

Prices open higher on 6/21 (a good sign for you) and drop to a low of 8424;
you risked $378.00. Stochastics have also crossed to the upside from about 50 -
another good sign for you. Prices begin to rise. On 6/23, prices gap to the upside
-a THIRD good sign for you.

S4 is drawn at a 45-degree angle for our illustration. Prices continue to
follow this line until 7/5 at which time they close at the high of the day at 8626.

From 6/24 to 7/6, stochastics stabilize at about 65 while prices rise to a high
of 8723 on July 1 (the Gann “I” Pivot Point). Prices are rising while stochastics
are not - divergence. This is a sign of possible price weakness and a change in
trend.

Anticipate liquidating your long position at the opening of 7/6, or placing a
tighter stop, perhaps at 8617, the low of 7/5.

After 7/6, as suggested by stochastic divergence, prices fall into mid-July,
when stochastics become oversold.

85
Prices react to another 50% Retracement Zone in early August. Referring
back to Chart 26, prices can be seen to eventually retrace 100% from the 5/23 low
of 8210 to the Gann Primary Pivot Point day of 8/16, with a low at 8220.

PART IX

What to Trade —
United States Treasury Bonds

One of the first questions many beginning traders ask is, “What is the best
market to trade?”

Well, what do you mean by“... the best...?” If you have hundreds of acres
growing coffee, why would you want to know the prices of Canadian rapeseed?
Let’s assume by “... the best... ,” you are asking which markets will be most
profitable for you to trade.

By sending away for commodity information, your name may end up on
mailing lists that send packets of advertising cards. Some of the claims, while
they may have occurred in the past, should not be considered as a guarantee of
what prices, or the company, may do for you in the future.

“$20,000 Profit In Just Two Months”

“Control over $40,000 of Gold for as Little as $500”

“Buy $20,000 Worth of Silver for $3,990”

“$4,000 in One Week .. . in the S&P 500 Index”

“$5,000 Returned $15,000 Cash (with) Precious Metals”

“Double Your Money .. . 600% Profit in 5 Years”

And the claims go on and on and on.

After a while, the more information you receive, the more confused you
become about which broker to use, or which commodity to trade. Appendix Ais
a list of markets currently traded on the American exchanges.

Of all the futures markets, the United States Treasury Bond market has

proven to be, overall, the most responsive, liquid and fastest-growing market.

88
The beginning trader should consider the T-Bond market as the first market in
which to trade.

A United States Treasury Bond is a security with a maturity longer than 10
years. The futures market trades those with twenty-year maturities. Bonds are
auctioned four times a year - in March, June, September and December; hence,
these are the contract months that are traded, with the last trading day being the
eighth from the last business day of the delivery month. The worldwide,
financial appeal of bonds results in billions of dollars flowing through these
financial instruments.

Bonds tend to rank among the highest of all futures markets in terms of
liquidity. The 1977 total annual volume for Treasury-Bond futures was about
one million contracts. In1986, that trading volume surged to almost 52.6 million
contracts. To the beginning trader, this means that there will always be either
a buyer, or a seller, for any number of Bond contracts the trader may wish to
transact.

The liquidity factor for Bonds in comparison to other commodities is
reflected in Table 3 on the next page. Listed are 44 commodity futures, their
exchanges, % margins, effective % margins, the number of contracts that are
required to be traded for equal dollar profit, and the relative contract liquidity
for each commodity. T-Bonds have the third highest rate of liquidity.

Treasury Bonds are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. One Bond
contract is an agreement to make delivery (a short position) or to later accept
delivery (long position) of $100,000, face value, of Treasury Bonds.

Bond prices are quoted in a percentage of par value. The minimum
increment is 1/32 of a point, or $31.25. (Appendix A will explain how to calculate
Bond prices.) If, for instance, a trader is long one contract and prices rise from
78% to 79% par value, the trader has made $1000 (32 points x $31.25). The daily
limit for Bonds (the maximum amount trading rules will allow Bond prices to
move above or below the previous day’s closing price) is 3 points (96/32nds), or
$3000 per contract.

Trading hours for Bonds are unique. Like most other futures, they are
traded during day sessions - 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM, Chicago time. But unlike other
futures, Bonds are also traded during evening hours - 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM,
Standard Time, and 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, Daylight Saving Time.*

T-Bonds are directly related to changes in interest rates. From a low of
approximately 7.25% in 1977 to the mid-14% experienced in 1981-82, interest
rates, and Bond prices, have had a financial roller-coaster ride. The new trader
can expect dramatic results trading T-Bond futures in days, rather than weeks
or months.

Margin requirements (the amount of money that is put “at risk” to trade)
may vary with individual brokers and a futures’ volatility. For Bonds, you may
expect a per-contract margin of $2500 to $3500, again depending upon many

89

variables.

But compared to margins for other financial and agricultural

markets, which have been as high as $7000, $10,000 and even up to $20,000 PER
CONTRACT, margins for Bonds are very attractive for the per-dollar return that
could be realized.

FUTURES.”

Trading Liquidity: Futures is a reference chart for speculators. It compares markets
according to their per-contract potential for profit and how easily contracts can be bought
or sold (1.e., trading liquidity). Each is a proportional measure and is meaningful only

when compared to others in the same column.

The number in the “Contracts to Trade for Equal Dollar Profit’ column shows how

“Relative Contract Liquidity” places commodities in descending order according to
how easily all of their contracts can be traded. Commodities at the top of the list are easiest
to buy and sell: commodities at the bottom of the list are the most difficult. “Relative

Contract Liquidity” is the number of contracts to trade times total open interest times a

many contracts of one commodity must be traded to obtain the same potential return as
another commodity. Contracts to Trade = (Tick $ value) x (3-year Maximum Price
Excursion).

PART X

Putting It All Together

This section covers eight trading sequences (which Gann called “cam-
paigns”). The contract is September 1989 T-Bonds. All the information that will
be used for trading has been covered in the previous nine sections. The trades
were taken as examples of using Retracement Zones, Stochastics and Gann
geometric angles.

DO NOT LOOK AHEAD TO ANY PAGES BEFORE YOU
REVIEW EACH PAGE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS
DONE, AND WHY. THIS IS IMPORTANT. IN REAL TRAD-
ING YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF LOOKING
FORWARD AT MARKET PRICES, COMING BACK TO
CURRENT PRICES AND SAYING “OH YEAH, PLL DO SUCH-
AND-SUCH BECAUSE...”

The following trading rules will be used. These same guidelines can be used
in real-time trading as well:

1) Locate points that qualify, by definition, as P1, P2 and P3.
Unless you know Gann or Elliott Wave techniques, P1 and P2 turning
points can be identified by definition and supported by stochastics.
1) Stochastics crossing under 20 and turning up suggests a
rising market.
2) Stochastics crossing over 80 and turning down suggests a
falling market.
Determine P1 and P2 points from the “under-20” or “over-80” stochas-
tic crossover points.

91
92

2)

3)

4)

Confirm that a new price trend from P2is starting. The start of a price

trend is confirmed when:

1) Both stochastics have been less than 20 (from bear to bull) or
greater than 80 (from bull to bear), have crossed over and are
reversing direction, and

2) Prices have reversed direction and closed above (or below) a 45-
degree line from a previous minor reaction point before P2.

3) Ina bear market, lower highs are being made.

4) Ina bull market, higher lows are being made.

Determine P3.

P3 is at the PRICE level of P1 and the TIME point of P2.

Draw L1 and L2 from P2 and L3 from P3.

L1 is a 63-degree line and L2 is a 45-degree line. L3 is a 45-degree
line.

Make sure the protractor is 90-degrees to time at P2 and horizon-
tal to the price level at Pl. (See Charts 31 and 32.)

Estimate the Gann geometric angle that prices are following.

Trending prices should follow a 45-, 63-, 75- or 82-degree Gann Angle.

Draw several angles from P2 until prices establish a trend. Don’t draw

this line too “tight” for prices - prices need room to move.

Take a long or short position after a trend is established.

A trend is established when:

1) Prices, on a closing basis, break a previous trendline from
the opposite direction of the new trend.

2) Thenewtrendisconfirmed by supporting indicators, suchas
stochastics.

Place stops along S5. Use either current-day or previous-day price

levels.

As prices enter the Retracement Zone, draw S5 from a minor low (if

prices are rising) or high (if prices are falling).

Prices crossing $5 could suggest a change in trend.

Anticipate a possible reaction at or near the midpoint of the Retrace-

ment Zone. If one occurs and prices close across S5, liquidate your

position.

If prices advance through the Retracement Zone, the next price target

could be at the 75%, and then the 100%, level.

Look for a new entry point.

If prices reverse in the Retracement Zone and your position is liqui-

dated, consider a new trade:

1) When prices close outside the Retracement Zone;
2) When the new trend is confirmed by stochastics.

A 26-degree line from P2 as S4 could be a good “first line of defense”

stop-loss line.

This line (unless there’s a substantial price jump) is your initial stop-

loss line as prices exit the Retracement Zone.

Hint: A good stop-loss price might be one point above the Signifi-
cant High or one point below the Significant Low. Keep this
stop until AFTER the first minor reaction. Minor reactions
after a Significant High or Low may cause prices to react
almost, but not quite, to the Significant High or Low.

In general, be flexible in your objectives. Anticipate several different

price reactions.

Never assume you “have to” make a set amount of money on a trade.

Take profits whenever you can.

In the following eight trades, $100 per trade was allowed for expenses.
Point value for Treasury Bonds is $31.25.

In November 1988, you begin watching the September 1989 contract for T-
Bonds. There is an upward trendline from early September through to Novem-
ber. Bonds peak around 9000 and decline. Stochastics also are declining.

In mid-November, stochastics cross 20 to the downside and prices begin to
churn. A low of 8600 is reached on 11/25. both prices and stochastics begin to
rise from that point. Stochastics break 20 to the upside.

By definition, the high of 11/1 at 8928 qualifies as Pl. The low of 11/25 at
8600 qualifies as P2. P3is on 11/25 at the 8900 level. L1, L2 and L3 are drawn.
A Retracement Zone results with a RZH of 8820 and a RZL of 8800.

Remember, this is ONLY A TARGET. THERE IS NO LAW THAT DIC-
TATES OR GUARANTEES THAT PRICES WILL ENTER THIS ZONE; ONLY
SOME ASSURANCE.

On11/29, prices close above L2 from P2, as well as above the minor reaction
point A of 8729 on 11/16. Stochastics have not broken 20 to the upside.

On 11/30, prices open and close above L2 as well as above the two 45-degree
lines from reaction points P1 and A. Stochastics are above 20 and rising. These
3 indicators suggest a bull move. You decide to buy on the opening the next day.

Prices open at 8715 on 12/1/89. Your stop is placed at 8612 (the point at
which 12/1/88 crosses S1, a 26-degree line from P2.) This is an unusually wide
stop, but recall that prices need room to move before they can establish a trend.
A closer stop would be the price level at which L2 crosses 12/1, or 8620.

On the evening of 12/2/88, you chart prices and find that they have fallen
- A LOT, to a low of 8620. You shake and sweat, get control and realize you’re
still in good shape.

Stochastic %K jogged a little, but %Dis still upward. S1 saved your position.
You're down about $500, BUT ONLY IF YOU SELL.

Monday, 12/5/88, was an “inside day” - that’s a good sign for you. Prices are
up - and so should be your stop. Move your stop to 8615, the price at which S1
crosses 12/5/88.

On12/6, you become a believer when you see that prices have closed at 8821!
You’re up over $1000 and want to call your broker to sell. But wait - re-evaluate
your position.

First, because of such a big move, anticipate some churning and draw both
a 75-degree and an 82-degree line from the low of 12/6, for future stops. Notice
that stochastics are still in the neutral zone.

Next, move your stop to a price level that will insure profits but leave room
for future price activity. This might be the level at which the 82-degree line
crosses 12/6, or the RZL of 8800.

On 12/7/88, prices straddle the RZH, opening at 8824 and closing at 8819.
The 82-degree line is a little tight, so you use the 75-degree line for stops. This
line crosses 12/8/88 at about 8805. Move your stop to 8805 for the market of 12/
8.

On 12/8/88, %K has turned down from 80. %D is beginning to turn. Move
your stop to the RZH of 8820 for trading on 12/9. Anticipate a downturn. (P.S.
The low of 12/8/88 was 8807. Using Gann geometric angles, our stop was at
8805.)

On 12/9/88, you’re stopped out at 8820.

For the next two days prices oscillate around the RZH, but there is no clear
indicator for taking a position. Stand aside. Notice though that the highs for 12/
7 at 8906 and 12/12 at 8905 were contained by S4 from P3.

Calculate a new Retracement Zone. P1 is the high of 12/12 at 8905. P2is
the low of 11/25 at 8600, and P3 is 8600 on 12/8/88. This results in a Retracement
Zone with a RZH of 8718 and a RZL of 8702, into which prices may trend for
another buying opportunity.

Refer to Chart 35.

You've completed your first trade:

TRADE 1: Sold on 12/9/88 @ 8820
Bought on 12/1/88 @ 8715
Total Points = 1-05 = 37 points

$1056.25 profit in 7 trading days!

Previous profit balance = -0-
Profit from Trade 1 = $1056.25
Current profit balance = $1056.25

You'll later read that “the trend is your friend.” The trendis up. Therefore,
take only long positions.

On 12/12 and 12/13, prices churn around the previous RZH of 8820. On 12/
14, stochastics have crossed to the downside. Prices have fallen on that day and
close at 8719, that price also being the low of the day. (Another coincidence; our
RZH is 8717).

Prices closing at 8719 are under the 45-degree line, B1, from the previous
minor reaction point on 12/2 at a low of 8620. Stochastics crossing, even in the
neutral zone, may normally be a sign of lower prices.

Prices are at the RZH of 8717. Remember, the RZH is the 50% retracement
level, at which Gann said prices would react. The RZL is 63% and allows some
margin for fundamental influences on prices.

A reaction to the upside could be anticipated. There is not enough profit
potential here to take a short position. The overall trend is up; therefore, only
long positions should be considered. Wait for a confirmation of an uptrend and
go long.

Anew uptrend is confirmed on 12/19. Prices have opened AND closed over
L1 from P2. At the same time, stochastics have turned up. This is a good place
to go long, with a potential target of 8924-9000. That price range is a 100%
retracement from 10/31 and 11/1.

On 12/20, you’re long at the opening of 8818. A stop is placed at 8800 (the
45-degree line, B2, from the 1 2/15 low of 8716, crossing 12/20). This risk is about
$600.

From the 12/15 low of 8716, 45-degree and 63-degree stop-loss lines are
drawn. Prices stabilize for two days, reacting back to the 63-degree line. You
determine that the 45-degree line, rather than the 63-degree line, will be used
for stops.

Prices gap to the upside. Because of this price jump, the angle for determin-
ing stops is changed from 45-degrees to 63-degrees. A stop for 12/23 is placed at
8824 - where 12/22 crosses the angle. On 12/23, stochastics have crossed 80 and
begin to turn. This is a sign of a possible change in trend.

On 12/23 you place a stop at 8904 - again where the 63-degree angle crosses
12/28 - for trading on 12/27. Tight stops should be used because of an anticipated
change of trend indicated by stochastics.

On 12/27, you’re stopped out at 8904. (The open and high of 12/27 was 8907
— pin-point accuracy!)

Stochastics turning in the over-80 zone is an indication of a possible move
to the downside. There are now two clear major turning points to establish the
next Retracement Zone, based on the stochastic activity.

The low of 11/22 at 8600, when stochastics crossed under 20, is Pl. The
recent high of 12/23 at 8916, when stochastics crossed over 80,is P2. P3is on12/
23 at the 8600 level. The resulting RZH is 8724 and the RZL is 8704.

On 12/29, prices have closed under L1 from 12/23 and stochastics have
crossed 80 to the downside. The market could be shorted on the next day’s
opening, with a stop at 8827 - the L1 level for that day.

This Retracement Zone could be a major area of resistance. If you calculate
the Retracement Zones for early-December, late-October-to-mid-November, and
mid-October, you will see they are all at about the same price levels. (Gann’s rule
held that there is strong resistance or support at a price level where two 50%
Retracement Zones occur.)

Both prices and stochastics seem to bein an uptrend. The RZH level of 8724
is the same level (100%) from which prices rebounded on 12/15. Rather than
chipping away to take small profits, consider using the 8724 level as a buying
opportunity.

TRADE 2: Sold on 12/27 @ 8904
Bought on 12/20 @ 8818
Total Points = 0-18 = 18 points

$462.50 profit in 4 days.

Previous profit balance = $1056.25
Profit from Trade 2 = $462.50

Here’s another coincidence. The low of 1/3 is 8721. The low of 1/4 is 8726. The
low of 1/5 is 8718. And the low of 1/6 is 8724. The RZH is 8724. (* on chart)

The lows for the next four days are 8812 (1/9), 8812 (1/10), 8812 (1/11) and
8810 (1/12). The low on 12/20 was 8817. Prices gapping up to this area indicate
it is an area of strong support. (** on chart)

On 1/10, stochastics stabilize and turn up. On 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11, prices
again stabilize in a tight channel.

On 1/12, prices make a bull move of 28 points, closing at 8906 for the day,
and near new highs.

Another Gann rule - buy new highs and sell new lows.

Stochastics have already turned up. Prices have closed over L2 for three
days.

After seeing price and stochastic activity up to 1/11 on Chart 38, buying the
market is the only way to go. Let’s assume you bought on the opening of the first
day after prices closed above L2 AND stochastics have crossed and are turning
up.

Your position is long at 8815 on 1/11 or 1/12. A stop is placed at 8803, the
price level at which the 45-degree line, line C from the 1/5 low of 8718, crosses
1/8.

Trading now may get a little tricky. Intuition and experience pay off. There
is a lot to be learned from examples like this one.

Prices have closed above two previous highs - mid-December’s 8915 and
early-November’s 8928. New highs to determine P2 have not been made.
Stochastics are bouncing around above 80, you’re long one September Bond from
8816 and ... now what?

First, notice the divergence. Prices are rising while stochastics are falling.
Prices seem to be in an upward channel.

In this instance, draw 45-degree lines from reaction points as your stop-loss
lines. Prices may fluctuate within this upward divergence channel. The easiest
and safest way to handle this is to set your stops and let the market take you out
of your position.

45-degree lines D and E are examples. Stops can be set at the price level of
the PREVIOUS day and stop-line level. If you prefer a little more room, set the
stops at the level of the SECOND-PREVIOUS day.

Another option may be to place sell orders 32 points above the previous day’s
high, while moving your stop up daily. That amount is a substantial move, but
if you get it, that’s all the more profit. If the market stops you out, that’s still
profit.

Using line E, and the price level of two previous days, your position would
have been stopped out on 1/31 at 9018.

Another winner, and a big one at that:

TRADE 3: Sold on 1/31 @ 9018
Bought on 1/10 @ 8816
Total Points = 2-03 = 67 points

$1993.75 profit in 15 trading days!

Previous profit balance $1518.75
Profit from Trade 3 = $1993.75
Current profit balance = $3512.50

When the expected bear move occurs, again a price target is needed. Two
Retracement Zones have been plotted. Both zones use the high of 1/27 at 9117
as P2.

P1-1 for the first zone is the 1/5 low of 8718 resulting in a RZH1 of 8829.

P1-2 for the second zone is the 11/25 low of 8600 resulting in a RZH2 of 8824
and a RZL2 of 8726.

During a divergent period, it is important to keep close stops. Prices may
have a tendency to collapse, and collapse with little warning. It’s something like
holding a balloon full of air and letting it go. Things happen very quickly and the

108
balloon (prices) could go every which way. Too wide of a stop may cause an undue
amount of profit to be lost.

If you doubt this, take a look at the next section and Chart 39. It will prove
the point.

LOOK OUT BELOW!!!

From the high of 9117 on 2/8, prices on 2/9 plummet right through our first
Retracement Zone into our second. On 2/10 prices reach a low of 8806, closing
at 8821. (The midpoint of the lower Retracement Zone is 8809).

Stochastics probably have already run half their course before you would
see them. But there is a clue. Whenever %K “hooks” sharply, like it did on 2/8,
anticipate a sudden and dramatic price move. This hook could come on the day
of the price move, or one day before.

There are not technicals a beginning trader could use to chart a move such
as this. Place your order, set your stop and hold on for the ride! A possible order
would be to cover your short position somewhere in the Retracement Zone.

Again, what you see in Chart 38 is the whole picture. On the evening of 2/
9 all you would see is the price collapse and the stochastics in the neutral area.
There is one clue to possible lower prices - the gap between 2/9 and 2/10. After
prices crash into the first Retracement Zone, and close on 2/9 at 8912, trading
opens on 2/10 at 8906. Knowing of that gap, you may want to short the market
with a potential target near the 63% level of the Retracement Zone. With such
downward momentum, a 100% retracement of 8718, or even 8600, may not be
unexpected.

Assuming you would want to crap shoot this trade, you could have shorted
the market after the opening of 2/10 and set your stops along either the 82-degree
or 75-degree line from the high on 2/8 of 9114.

Both stochastic values cross 20 on 2/14/89. Considering the size of the move
and accumulated profit in two days, why wait for “just that little bit more?” Cover
your shorts on the opening of 2/15 at 8803. (The low for the day was 8801.)

Taking this trade would have aptly rewarded you.

Refer to Chart 40.
TRADE 4: Sell short on 2/10 @ 8908
Bought on 2/15 @ 8804
Total Points = 1-04 = 36 points

$1025.00 profit in 3 trading days!

From early February to early March, prices vibrate between the RZH of
8824 and the RZL of 8726. Stochastics remain oversold, with no definitive sign
of movement either up or down.

A 45-degree trendline (F) drawn from a minor reaction point on 2/21 ata
high of 8902, is broken on 3/6 with prices opening and closing above it. Prices are
still under the RZH of 8824. This could be either a resistance or support level.

On 3/8, prices close at 8826. On 3/9, prices again close under the RZH of
8814. Both stochastics have risen above 20.

From doing so well on your last four trades, you feel confidentin your ability,
and decide to buy the market on 3/10 at the opening of 8820 (even without very
decisive signals). A stop is placed at the RZL of 8726.

Time to make more money.

Whoops... what happened? On 3/13, the day after placing your order, you
get stopped out for a loss of $812.50 (including commission), when prices drop to
a low of 8725. (Our RZL is 8726. Does this suggest something about the
Retracement-Zone limits?)

This same thing happened to me recently, trading with Platinum. That was
a $1000 per-contract loss in an hour. But that’s OK (it is?). You’ve learned
another Gann lesson. Remember, you must expect some losses and not let it
affect your trading. No system is 100% perfect.

You assumed prices would have to rise because stochastics suggested they
“have to.” Prices don’t “have to” do anything.

This is another admonition of Gann. Never trade on hope, greed or fear. We
did two out of the three in this case. Because we had four winning trades, we got
greedy, assumed prices would do what we thought they would do and hoped for
another $1000-in-3-days move.

Trade by the rules that have proven themselves and with which you are
comfortable. Never trade because you think you “have to” trade.

Prices rise for three straight days after your first loss. On 3/15 and 3/16
prices open AND close above L2, drawn from the 1/27 high of 9117. Stochastics
are rising into the neutral zone. But being a little gun-shy from your first loss,
and remembering that the RZH at 8824 seems to be strong resistance, you decide
to wait.

Good decision!

Refer to Chart 42.

Your first loss:

TRADE 5: Bought on 3/10 @ 8820
Stopped out on 3/11 @ 8726
Total Points = 26 points

$912.50 one-day loss

Previous profit balance = $4537.50
Loss from Trade 5 = $ 912.50

Well, if one price collapse is good, then two must be better. And this third
one must be the best of all. It brings us back to within 14 points of where we
started in late November.

On 3/17, from an opening at 8810, prices tumble 57 points to a low of 8617.
They stabilize for two days and begin to rise, but are contained by the downward
45-degree line, line G, from P1.

A target Retracement Zone is plotted with a RZH of 8804 and a RZL of 8723.
This could be only a minor reaction area, because stochastic values for the P1 of
3/8 are in the neutral zone. (A better P1, indicated by stochastics being above 80,
would be at 9114 on 2/8.)

Prices eventually may exceed this 8804 - 8723 zone because of a suggestive
stochastic indicator. On 3/17, the day prices fell, %D can be seen to have turned
sharply downward. On 3/22, stochastics again can be seen to have turned
sharply - this time upward. Recall that this sharp turn - described as a
"hook" - suggests a strong and sudden price move. Since this is the case, we would
be looking for a buying opportunity somewhere in the 8723 - 8804 range.

Both stochastic values cross 20 to the upside on 3/27. Prices have previously
closed at 8714 - above the minor 75-degree trend line F.

Normally, prices closing above a minor trend line and stochastic values
indicating an uptrend, could be a buy signal. However, the risk-to-reward ratio
for taking a trade is not good.

To go long above 8714 would require a stop at 8624, L2 crossing the day.
Prices are approaching a Retracement Zone with possible resistance levels at
8723 and 8804. The minimum profit you could anticipate would be to 8724 (the
RZL), or about $343. You're risking twice whet you could anticipate making.
Stand aside for a better buying opportunity.

Refer to Chart 43.

On 3/28 prices open and close above line G. On 3/29 prices close at 8802 (the
RZH from Chart 43 is 8804). Stochastics are in mid-range with a strong upward
bias. This could be the buying opportunity for which we've been looking.

On 3/30, you're long at the opening of 8808 with a stop at 8720 (L1 crosses
3/19). Anew Retracement Zone is drawn, with P1 being the 2/3 high of 9116, P2
as the 3/12 low of 8610 and P3 at the 9116 level on 3/12. The RZH is 8924 and
the RZL is 8829.

Prices escalate upward for two days, with a high on 4/3 of 8912. This high
is only three points away from the 8909 midpoint of the new Retracement Zone.
Prices retreat a bit, but still straddle the RZL of 8900.

On 4/5 %K is at 85 and %D is at 78. Stochastics are turning. Look back
several months on the chart. The area of 8824 - 8900 seems to be a real
resistance/support area. Draw a horizontal resistance line at each of these
levels. In this area you're already up about $800 in three days. Time to get out.
If you didn’t sell at the mid-point of the Retracement Zone or let the 63-degree
L1 stop you out, you could have placed, on 3/30, a good-till-cancel sell order for
8909.

Stochastics are turning, prices stabilize for a day or two, but notice that the
general trend of the market from September is still up. Any reaction occurring
here may only be temporary profit-taking before the bull move continues. If the
8912 high of 3/20 turns out to be a significant high, another Retracement Zone
at about 8724 can be calculated. This would be the place to buy the market.

Refer to Chart 44.

The winning continues:

TRADE 6: Sold on 4/3 @ 8909
Bought on 3/30 @ 8804
Total Points = 1-05 = 37 points

$1056.25 profit in 2 trading days!

Previous profit balance = $3825.00
Profit from Trade 6 = $1056.25
Current profit balance = $4681.25

Prices peak at 8914 on 4/7, with that point becoming P2. P1 is the low of
8614 on 3/21 and P3 is at the level of 8614 on 4/17. A RZH of 8802 and a RZL of
8712 are formed.

From P2 prices begin to drop. But with the strong, general uptrend of prices
from mid-March, there is strong assurance of much higher prices.

Rather than waiting for prices to evolve and drawing trendlines and
retracement zones until the price bars can’t even be seen, try this.

Place an order to buy the market at the 50% level, with a stop at the 63%
level of 8712.

Look at Chart 45. Stochastics broke 80 to the downside and prices began
to consolidate on 4/10 and 4/11, above the RZH (50%). An order to buy the
market at 8802 (RZH) with a stop at 8712 (RZL) could have been placed. This
is arisk of about $700. If you want less risk, place your buy order at the midpoint
of the Retracement Zone (8723) with a stop at 8712. Just realize that there is less
chance of your order being filled.

On 4/13, your order to buy at 8802 is filled. Prices on 4/14 jump 30 points,
closing at 8831.

Buying at the 50% level in this case would have gotten you in within four
points of the low of the trend. A close near the top of a range without a gap on
the following day (this occurred on 4/14) strongly suggests even higher prices are
to come.

After 4/21, prices trend in an upward channel. Corresponding stochastics
level off.

On 4/27 and 4/28 prices are reaching new highs for the trend. Stochastics
are still leveling off. This same thing happened in mid-January. Anticipate a
bear move due to this divergence.

From the minor reaction point of 4/14 at 8725, draw a 45-degree and 63-
degree line. After the price jump to the 9000 mark and a reaction, prices seem
to follow the 63-degree line closer than following the 45-degree line.

Great. Use the 63-degree line as a stop-loss line, with the 45-degree line as
a change-in-trend line. Again, your concern is not WHEN to liquidate your
position, but WHERE.

A good-till-cancel sell order is placed for 9005 on 4/26 (one point above the
high of 4/20). At the same time, the stop order is moved up along the 63-degree
line daily. The price-limit channel you've established is getting narrower and
narrower.

The high of 4/26 is 9004. This is the same high of 4/20. There is apparent
resistance. Stochastics are above 80. Time to get out.

On 4/27, your broker calls to tell you your order was filled at 9005. Ifit had
not been filled, you would have been stopped out anyway on 5/1 at 8920, the price
at which the 63-degree line crosses 5/1.

Prices are stillin a 8908-9013 channel. Stochastics are consolidating, under
80. Again... divergence. And from our previous experience, a sudden move in
prices could be anticipated.

The long-term trend for Bonds is definitely up. The logical plan would be
to buy at a 50% pullback. Use stochastics to assist in determining P1 and P2.

P1 is the significant low at 8614 on 3/21. Stochastics “hooked” under 20.

P2 is the 9013 high of 4/28. Stochastics peaked a third time during
divergence. (Hint: things always seem to happen after the third time in futures
trading.) P3 is at 8614 on 4/15. The RZH is 8814 and the RZL is 8724.

Don’t turn the page yet. Mark down this trade:

Buy at 8814, stop at 8724, good till cancel.

If this last order you placed was in a baseball game, instead of the futures
market, it would be called a “bang-bang” play. If it were in a popular beer
commercial, it would be described as “.. . not getting much better than this.”

On 5/10 your order to buy the September Bonds at 8814 is filled. On 5/11
Bonds consolidate for a day, moving only a couple of points up or down from the
previous day.

And then on the 8rd day (I told you so) - bang, bang. Prices close at 9025.
That’s a move of 74 points and a gross return of $2312.50 per contract.

Well, that’s fine, but IT DOES get better (much better) than this.

On 5/11 stochastics again “hook” in mid range, indicating there is more
movement in this market. Recall that whenever a large move occurs (74 points
in one day is a LARGE move), traders are going to take profits. And when that
happens, prices may consolidate or decline before continuing. Unfortunately,
there is no way a beginning trader has of knowing how much of either will occur.
Now is the time to protect profits. There are two ways of protecting profits in a
situation as this.

Drawing an 82-degree Gann Line will work, but may be impractical. It
doesn’t leave much room for the market to work. Instead, consider using a 63-
or 75-degree line intersecting the day. This will give you the price level at which
to place your stop.

If you're tired of angles, look at past price activity. It appears that from mid-
December there has been an area around 8920 that has acted as resistance to
rising prices, or support for falling prices. Then too, the most-recent high prior
to this move was at 9012. Somewhere in between may be good.

It’s a personal preference, refined with experience, that will serve you best.
There are no fast and firm rules for setting stops.

Refer to Chart 47.

During May and early June, stochastics remain oversold and divergent to
prices. Certainly you want to maintain your position, protect past profits and
insure future profits.

Stochastics are of little orno help in determining turning points. TheG.E.T.
software has generated a continuing signal to disregard stochastics. As prices
are evolving, you will not know how much farther they may or may not rise, or
the angle at which they will move.

Recall again that Gann called a 1x1 Gann Line the “Death Line.” Breaking
that line signals the end of a trend.

Use Gann’s 1x1 theory this way. From every minor reaction during the
uptrend, draw a 45-degree and 63-degree line. In Chart 42, using the 45-degree
line results in stops of $1500 to $2000. Much too much. The 63-degree line,
though, reduces stops to about $500 - $700. Much more manageable.

Should prices start becoming “too tight” for the 63-degree line, and you
think they need more room to “move,” use the 45-degree line for stops.

Such a situation occurred on 5/26. Prices reacted due to profit taking,
stabilized for five days, and continued the bull move. After the big move of 5/30
to highs of 9300, stops could have been along the 63-degree line, again until they
became too tight for prices.

But remember:

IN A RISING MARKET, NEVER LOWER YOUR
STOP FROM ITS CURRENT LEVEL.

IN A FALLING MARKET, NEVER RAISE YOUR
STOP FROM ITS CURRENT LEVEL.

If, for instance, your stop is at 9400 using the 63-degree line and changing
to the 45-degree line would reduce the stop to 9324, DON’T. Keep your stop at
9400 until the 45-degree line “catches up” to 9400.

You will always have trading situations in which you think you could have
“gotten a couple more points” and think you were stopped out prematurely.
“What could have been” does not make profits. “What already has been” does.

Using 63-degree lines to determine stops would have kept you in the market
until 9516 on 6/15. (Stochastics, on this day, broke 80 to the downside.) Not bad
at all.

128
Chart 48 is the entire price range of the September 1989 Treasury Bond
contract that we’ve been trading. The final tally for profits is:

TRADE 8: Sold on 6/15 @ 9516
Bought on 5/10 @ 8814
Total Points = 7-02 = 226 points

$6962.50 in 25 trading days.

Previous profit balance = $ 6675.00
Profit from Trade 8 = $ 6962.50
Current profit balance = $13,637.50

$13,637.50 PROFIT IN SEVEN MONTHS.

That profit was realized from:
1) An hour or two of charting prices per night.
2) A little common sense, understanding the 50% Retracement
Rule, and other basic Gann rules.
3) Trading only one contract in one market.

In Part XI, you'll see examples of using Gann’s 50% Rule and Retracement
Zones for various markets, years and time periods.

The more practice and the more charts you see, the more you'll find that the
suggestions contained here work - time after time after time.

The guidelines of THE W. D. GANN METHOD OF TRADING - A SIMPLI-
FIED CLEAR APPROACH can be used with any period of trading- from 5-,
15-, 30- and 60-minute tick charts for intraday trading, to daily, weekly, and
even to monthly bar charts.

The rules can be used in agricultural, financial, currency, or any other
markets. Price projections can be made without a computer or even a calculator.
The procedures can be refined to any number of trades or contracts you wish to
make.

THE W. D. GANN METHOD OF TRADING - A SIMPLIFIED CLEAR
APPROACH, is not a be-all-end-all system of trading commodities. It will not
bring overnight wealth. Such a system does not exist.

But with a little effort and a reasonable amount of paper trading to learn the
principles involved, Gann's methods will give you a sound understanding and
basis for earning consistent profits.

The following charts are of the December, 1989, S&P 500 contract.

132

TRADING THE S&P 500 CONTRACT

CHART 49:

Chart 49 begins on 6/30 at a low of 32200. Prices begin to rise.
The possible uptrend is confirmed on 7/5 and 7/6 by stochastics,
which appear below the bar chart.

Price momentum "stalls out” between 7/20 and 7/24. Prices are
in a channel between the high of 34470 on 7/20, and the low of
33850 on 7/23.

On 7/27, prices gap to the upside from the previous-day's high
of 34500, (by opening at 34582 and reaching a low of only
34530).

Prices continue the uptrend until 8/7 and 8/11, when equal
highes of 35770 (8/7) and 35780 (8/11) are reached. On 8/11
prices close at 35111 with stochastics confirming a possible
change-in-trend. This is important.

Stochastics remain overbought between 7/13 and 8/10. There
appears to be no clear indication for future price direction.

Prices should now turn down ... BUT HOW FAR? Based on
our method - to a zone of 35770-35820.

Chart 50:

134

In Chart 50, prices have fallen to a low of 34440 on 8/20, and then
gapped to the upside, reaching a top of 35840 on 8/25.

Gaps are usually good, except in a situation as this. Anticipate price
falling to the 34920 - 34552 area.

THE W. D.GANN METHOD OF TRADING - A SIMPLIFIED, CLEAR
APPROACH explains:

¢ WHY, in such a situation, a gap MAY NOT be a buy signal.
© WHY only BUY, and not SELL orders should be placed,

¢ WHY lower prices could be anticipated to the 35022 - 34650
area,

¢ WHEN, and AT WHAT PRICE the market could be bought,
and

¢ HOW FAR prices may fall again, before another buying
opportunity occurs.

Chart 51:

136

On 9/15, prices have fallen to within only 2 points of our projected zone
of 34920 - 34552, to a low of 34550. But prices CLOSE ABOVE THE
ZONE, at 34965. Again, prices churn within a channel, BUT NEVER
FALL BELOW 34550.

An uptrend is confirmed on 9/29, at which time the market could be
bought.

On 10/4, indicators suggest a top may be approaching.

The long position is stopped out on 10/11 and a short position taken on
the opening of 10/12 at 36025.

WELCOME TO THE FRIDAY-THE-13TH CRASH!

Principles presented in THE W. D.GANN METHOD OF TRADING - A
SIMPLIFIED, CLEAR APPROACH, could have allowed you to be short
on the opening of 10/13.

Staying short from an entry of 36025 on 10/12 could have NETTED AP-
PROXIMATELY $15,000 on "Friday the 13th."

On 10/16, the market opened within a range that could have been
projected using the February 27 low of 29890.

Granted, the 10/13 crash was an exceptional event, but what is more
important is this:

THE SAME PRINCIPLES USED TO CHART SUCH A
POTENTIAL PROFIT (AS ON 10/13), APPLY TO ALL
MARKETS, AND ALL TIME PERIODS.

Chart 53:

140

Chart 53 is the 12/89 S&P 500 contract from 1/27 to 10/31/89.

One more potential profit opportunity on 10/20 is evident after 10/13.
The Retracement Zone for Chart 53 was established by using the 2/27
low of 29890 and the 10/10 high of 36450 - a time period of over 7 1/2

months and 6560 points.

The Zone has a high limit of 33170 and a low limit of 32110 - arange of
1060 points. The midpoint of the range is 32640.

Even after a 7-1/2 month period, a price spread of 6560 points, and a
violent, one-day collapse of over 3000 points on 10/13, prices halt JN
THE RETRACEMENT ZONE.

EVEN AFTER two violent days of price swings, such as those of 10/13
and 10/16, two more trading opportunities are evident, using Gann's

Rules.

THE W. D.GANN METHOD OF TRADING - A SIMPLIFIED, CLEAR
APPROACH WORKS!

Charts 54 and 55 on the following page show the September ’89 Bond
contract chart with some different studies. All these studies are available on the
G.E.T. software, listed at the end of this book.

Chart 54 compares stochastic activity with Gann Pivot Points. The Primary
(P) Gann Pivot Points are the most significant. From Chart 54 , itis clear that
the high of 9800 is not the highest price at which Bonds will sell, since a Primary
Gann Pivot Point has not yet registered.

Chart 55 reflects long-term and short-term Elliott Wave counts. If you
trade by Elliott Waves, or want to learn this effective method of technical
analysis, invest in one of the many Elliott Wave books. There is no better way
of learning Elliott.

PART XI

Does It Work All the Time?

In this section are 19 charts illustrating Retracement Zones and Gann’s
50%, 63%, 75% and 100% levels.

There are various markets, including the S&P 500 Index, Treasury Bonds
and Swiss Franc. These three markets generally are the more stable and
rhythmic. Agriculturals, metals and those subject to foreign influence may not
be as desirable for a beginning trader, because of sensitive fundamentals (such
as weather) and governmental influences.

Time periods include intraday (5- and 15-minute intervals), daily, weekly,
monthly and yearly.

On all the charts, Gann geometric angles and Retracement Zones are used
to project price targets and trends. Those that appear are the most obvious. They
are by no means the ONLY Gann geometric angles and Retracement Zones. You
can practice charting other Retracement Zones by following the methods pre-
sented. Using different colored pens will help in seeing the Retracement Zones’
inter-relationships.

The following Gann rules can be seen in the charts’ price activity:

1) Prices will significantly react at the 50% retracement level.

2) Ifprices exceed the 50% retracement level, the next level at which
they will react is the 62-1/2% retracement level.

3) Ifprices exceed the 62-1/2% retracement level, the next level at
which they will react is the 75% retracement level.

4) Ifprices exceed the 75% retracement level, the strongest level of
support or resistance will be the 100% level.

5) Support and resistance levels also occur at multiples of 50%,
62 1/2%, 75% and 100%.

. Line 1 is 26 degrees. This may have something to do with Gann'ts theory of

pre-determined points of resistance and support.

- This retracement occurred on the 58th trading day.

PART XII

Getting Started

“Trading financial instruments is arguably the purest way onearth
to make money. There is a certain Zen to any occupation which
requires you to render no service, and produce no product and yet,
by simply gathering information and making decisions, allows you
to profit. Of course, the rub is that to be successful, you must be able
to collect that information and interpret it better than the next guy.”
Steve Notis

“Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities” Magazine

While trading futures can be very profitable, itis also extremely volatile and
speculative. For this reason, there are several “caveats” about futures trading
that must be made.

1) USEONLY RISK CAPITAL -MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

There must be sufficient financial security - savings, a home, insur-
ance, college fund. Whatever your needs may be for personal financial
security, they must be satisfied before risking capital on futures
trading.

Most firms require an initial margin of anywhere from $5000 to
$20,000. While it’s exciting to put up a $3500 margin for a contract of
T-Bonds, knowing that Bonds “only have to move 1%” for you to make
$1000, that $3500, AND MORE, CAN BE JUST AS EASILY LOST.

The money in your account can be multiplied many times over in future
months and years. It can also be lost in hours.

163

3)

In his book, WALL STREET STOCK SELECTOR, Gann includes a
section titled “Can a man lose $100,000,000” (pgs. 33-34). Gann lists
some huge, huge losses by experienced investors. Here are just a few.

¢ J.O. Armour lost over $300,000,000

e W.C. Durant lost $120,000,000

¢ Daniel Drew lost $13,000,000 and died broke.

¢ Thomas W. Lawson was worth between $30,000,000 and

$50,000,000 - and lost it all.

I think it’s a fair statement that many of you reading this may never
be in a position to lose eight or nine figures. The point, however, is
crystal clear. Don’t mortgage the farm to play with futures.

KNOW YOUR BROKER.

The brokerage business is one of big competition and big bucks. The
greatest majority of brokers, especially futures brokers, are honest,
competent money managers who have only their clients’ best interest
at heart. My own broker described his position to me this way:

“Sometimes, I think my most important job is not to write tickets or
trade futures, but to keep my clients from hurting themselves.”

(Send me a stamped, self-addressed envelope. I'll send you his
card.)

Deal with a broker who you can meet. For the beginning trader, having
a full-service broker - one who knows the markets and can advise you
when to getin- AND WHEN TO STAY OUT - is worth many times the
higher commissions you may pay.

One broker cannot service all clients. The broker who might be good
for your friends may not be right for you. You will have to find one with
whom you share common interests and will feel comfortable.

With a good broker - one that’s good for you - you will make a friend as
well as dollars.

LEARN FROM ALL THE MATERIAL THAT’S AVAILABLE.

Appendix D is a list of information sources including books, charting
services, commodity exchanges, computer hardware and software,
and periodicals concerning futures trading.
4)

Read the listed books, contact vendors for their information, and
research and talk to people involved in the commodities industry.
There may be material that, like brokers, is right for you, and not for
others.

Whatever information you receive, however remote you may think it
is at the time, is important. By reading this far, you have certainly
shown an interest in futures trading. Capitalize on that interest and
read all that you can on the subject.

LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

There will be losses; that’s the only sure thing of futures trading. But
what you do about those losses is important.

You could forget about them and hope they will go away.

Or you could accept them as a learning experience, go back over the
charts you’ve maintained (as I know you have), and find out what went
wrong. More often than not, you'll find out the losses happened not
because of the markets, but because of what Gann described as “fear
and greed.”

Gann felt that, when a trader finds himself in a losing position, he will
refuse to accept his position out of fear of losing money and hold onto
that lost cause, rather than getting out of a bad position and learning
from his mistakes.

Greed causes one of Gann’s “Twenty-Four Never Failing Rules” to be
violated - never let a profit turn into a loss. Out of greed, a trader will
hold on to a winning position “just a little bit longer.” Unfortunately,
that “... little bit longer .. . “ often reverses profits into losses.

Making mistakes is part of learning futures trading. There is nothing
wrong with making mistakes as long as you learn from those mistakes.

_ Ifyou are just learning about the futures markets and the large number of

technical studies that exist today, you may not have access to a computer and the
software to generate charts, or know where to find charts (aside from those
companies in Appendix D). I have a suggestion.

Most major libraries have business sections. Take $5.29, go to the Business

Section and ask them for their book of commodity charts. You will find intraday,

165
daily, weekly and monthly charts. Xerox $4.00 worth of charts. It doesn’t matter
which contracts or time periods you choose, but choose those contracts and time
periods that have a fair amount of up-and-down, rather than sideways, action.

Go to a local office-supply store and buy a protractor with the remaining
$1.29.

Take the charts and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! “Paper trade”
a $10,000 account for yourself. Cover the right portion of the chart and project
50% Retracement Zones. It may surprise you how often, and predictable, Gann
Retracement Zones occur.

While paper trading, you may want to remember some of Gann’s rules and
suggestions:

1) TRADE FOR THE LONG TERM

Leave the intraday trading and scalping to the professional traders
who have the time, knowledge and capital to trade in this way.

2) TRADE WITH THE TREND

If the market is going up, trade only the long positions from bear
reactions. If the market is falling, trade only the short positions from
bull reactions.

“The trend is your friend.”

3) TRADE FOR A REASON
Never trade just to trade. Know why the trade is being made.
“Ifin doubt, stay out.”

4) TRADE AT THE MARKET

Never limit your orders, fix a buying or selling price, or think the
market “has to” go up or go down. The market doesn’t “have to” do
anything; it does not care how much cash you have at risk.

The Retracement Zones illustrated here and those that you will calculate
are only targets. There can be some assurance, BUT NO GUARANTEE, that
prices will always act as described in this publication.

It is for this reason that, while Gann’s 50% Retracement Rule is a good rule,
it should not be the ONLY rule used to trade risk capital.

166
PAST PRICE PERFORMANCES ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OF FUTURE
PRICE ACTIVITY.

In writing this book, I tried to include some lighter comments. However,
understand this:

COMMODITY TRADING IS A DEADLY-SERIOUS VEN-
TURE. VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY CAN BE MADE - AND
LOST - IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

FOR THIS REASON, LEARN AS MUCHAS YOU CAN ABOUT
TRADING BEFORE ENTERING EVEN ONE TRADE.

AND ONCE YOU ENTER THAT TRADE, NEVER ASSUME
ANYTHING ABOUT PRICE MOVEMENTS AND TRENDS.

GANN SAID IT ALL:

“NEVER TRADE ON HOPE AND FEAR. KNOW WHY THE
TRADE IS BEING MADE.”

And remember .. . practice makes perfect - and profits.

Good luck and good trading.

should at least carry this paper around with you.) There is a wealth of
information here that becomes invaluable as you become more familiar with the

markets.

APPENDIX C

Calculating Treasury Bonds Prices

Calculating prices for T-Bonds is more difficult than for other commodities.
Bond prices are quoted in 32nds, rather than in multiples of a hundred. This
requires adding or subtracting in 32/32nds.

For instance, the Retracement Zone for Chart 8 has a RZH of 8510 and a
RZL of 8412. The midpoint of this Zone is 8427. Butif8412 were subtracted from
8510, and the remainder divided by 2, the answer is 49, NOT 8427.

The Bond price of 8510 is 85 and 10/32nds and often written as “85-10.” The
Bond price of 8412 is 84 and 12/32nd and can be written as “84-12.”

Adding or subtracting Bond prices requires “borrowing” 32/32nds from the
whole-number portion of the price and then adding it to the fractional portion of
the price. This is an example from Chart 8:

RZH: 85-10/32 = 84-42/32
RZL: 84-1 2/32 = - 84-12/32
30/32

30/32 = 15/32

2

RZL: 84-1 2/32
1/2 Retracement Zone: +_ 15/32
Retracement Zone Midpoint: 84-27/32

If you trade Treasury Bonds, and prefer to work with decimals instead of
thirty-seconds, I’ve included a conversion chart on the next page.

Regardless of what commodity you wish to trade - from French Robusta
Coffee, to Japanese Toyohashi Dried Cocoon, to Malaysian Rubber, to Nether-
landian Eggs, to United Kingdom Potatoes and, of course, Uruguanian Agricul-
turals - there’s a market for it.

COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE;
COMPUTERIZED DATA

Computer hardware and software for trading are generally available in
three ways:

1)

2)

3)

Complete hardware, software and data-retrieval packages.
CQG is the most-widely known.

For a monthly fee which includes hardware leasing, data-retrieval,
technical analysis software, data lines, and exchange fees, a CQG unit
can be installed at your location - home or office.

Computer boards with integrated data-retrieval and technical analy-
sis software for your PC for both real-time (as price ticks are occurring)
and end-of-day quotes.

An example of a real time quote service is FutureSource.

For a security deposit and a monthly fee, FutureSource supplies
technical analysis software, a data-retrieval card, and real-time
data (price ticks as they are occurring). The data is received by
your computer via a dedicated telephone line or satellite dish.

End-of-day quotes are available through companies such as CSI.

CSI charges a monthly fee for integrated technical analysis and
data-retrieval software for retrieving data via your computer's
modem and telephone line.

Separate data and technical analysis software.

Lotus Signal will supply the data. An independent technical analysis
software package, such as Equis International’s “Meta Stock” can be
used. The Lotus referral in this section can supply a list of compatible
software programs that can be used with Lotus Signal.

The beginning trader may already have a basic, IBM-compatible XT

computer. This may be an economical way to learn about commodities
and technical analysis.

A dot matrix/near-letter-quality is fine.
A letter-quality or laser printer looks nice, but for
commodity trading, money is made with price ticks,
rather than price charts. The number of chart colors
doesn’t matter. The bottom line is the information on
the chart.

Anticipate an investment of between $3500 and $5500 for
the hardware, keeping in mind that:

1) You get what you pay for, and

2) Itis a business investment.

Trading Courses.

Price charts used in this publication, unless otherwise noted, are from the
Gann-Elliott Trading (G.E.T.) System, developed by Tom Joseph of Trading
Techniques Inc. It is a software package well worth the investment for those
wishing to learn technical analysis but may be too much for the beginning trader.

The G.E.T. System must be seen to be fully appreciated. G.E.T.’s technicals
include Gann Clusters, Gann Angles, Elliott Wave counts (both long-term and
short-term), Fibonacci retracements, an Auto Trade mode, and two unique
features - T.J.’s Web levels and the 5/35 Oscillator. (As of this writing, a new
version of G.E.T. has just been released and is better than ever!)

The G.E.T. manual not only explains the program, but includes a clear and
practical presentation of Elliott Wave theory.

The “P,” “J,” “1” and “M” points appearing on some charts are computerized
Primary, Major, Intermediate and Minor Gann Price Pivot Points. The software

187
measures the percentage price swing from each high and each low and defines
each price swing accordingly. Gann Lines generating from these Pivot Points
have varying degrees of influence on a price trend. For instance, the lines
originating from a “P” point have the most influence on future prices. Lines
originating from an “M” point have the least influence. This is one of the
proprietary features of the software.
And no, Iam NOT selling the software, nor do I have any financial interests
in Trading Techniques. Credit is just being given where credit is due.

Request for Information

The field of commodity trading is expanding every day. It is difficult for any
one person to keep up with the ever-increasing amount of information about
commodity trading.

I may be able to help.

Over the years, I’ve received more information than I could have included in
this manual. In appreciation for investing in my book, I’d be happy to share
