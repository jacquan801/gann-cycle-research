                                            Foreword
Everyone who writes a book has some definite aim or objective. Some write to relieve pent-up
emotions, some for financial gain, others for fame and ambition, but the writer who does the
greatest good for his readers and for himself, is the man who writes with a sincere desire to help
others. The greatest good that we can do for others is to show them how to help themselves when
they are ready and want assistance, and to make them independent instead of dependent. The
man who can render helpful service to others is a success and enjoys happiness and peace of
mind through giving the best he has.

My objective in writing The Magic Word is to show others the way to use and obey God's divine
law and thus help them to bring out their latent talents and their God-given powers, for that is the
only way they can realize health, happiness and prosperity.

I write with the knowledge that I have already received many blessings by applying the Magic
Word and give thanks for the rewards I have received and shall hope to receive from my efforts
in trying to help others. When they find the way through the Magic Word to a realization of their
hopes and desires they will bless me for directing them in the right path. I feel certain millions of
people will read The Magic Word and benefit by it.

                              Introduction to
                            THE MAGIC WORD
The Bible teaches a divine law and how you can make it work. It teaches two things: Obedience
to the law brings reward, disobedience to the law brings punishment. The Good Book does not
say that you have to wait until after death to receive a reward. What people want is health,
happiness and prosperity here and now on this earth, not a promise of something after they are
dead. This is a practical religion and the Magic Word, Jehovah, will teach you how to get what
you need, here and now! Prove all things and hold fast to that which is good.

In the beginning the Word already existed; the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

From the very beginning the Word was with God.

Through him God made all things; not one thing in all creation was made without him.

The Word was the source of life, and this life brought light to people.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.

God sent his messenger, a man named John,

Who came to tell people about the light, so that all should hear the message and believe.

He himself was not the light; he came to tell about the light.

This was the real light -- the light that comes into the world and shines on all people.

The Word was in the world, and though God made the world through him, yet the world did not
recognize him -- John 1:1-10.




                                                 b
            What The Magic Word Does For You
What gives life is God's Spirit; human power is of no use at all. The words I have spoken to you
bring God's life-giving Spirit. -- John 6:63.

This is proof of the power in the word JEHOVAH. The Bible says that God is spirit and John
says that words are spirit and life. The word JEHOVAH will give you life, renewed energy and
health.

You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. -- John 8:32.

It is important to know what the truth is that will make you free. The Magic Word, JEHOVAH,
is the truth. Jesus said, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed." Therefore,
the word is what makes you free and removes all doubts and fears.

They answered, "We do not want to stone you because of any good deeds, but because of your
blasphemy! You are only a man, but you are trying to make yourself God!"

Jesus answered, "It is written in your own Law that God said, "You are gods.

We know that what the scripture says is true forever; and God called those people gods, the
people to whom his message was given. – John 10:33-35.

Jesus meant that they were children of God and that if they obeyed the word they were gods
because they had the power of the Magic Word, JEHOVAH.

Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to his word; instead, put it into practice.

If you listen to the word, but do not put it into practice you are like people who look in a mirror
and see themselves as they are.

They take a good look at themselves and then go away and at once forget what they look like. --
James 1:22-24.

You must put The Magic Word, JEHOVAH, into action. Knowing the word and not doing will
not get results. You must continue to repeat and concentrate on the word.

From this you can see that the word for which such great search has been made and which so
many people expect to be so far from them find that it is in their hearts and in their mouths. All
that you need to do to get health, happiness and wealth IS TO USE THE WORD JEHOVAH;
SPEAK IT, ACT IT, PRAY WITH IT, AND MEDITATE AND CONCENTRATE ON IT. You
must learn to speak the Magic Word, JEHOVAH, at the time and place given in another chapter.
If you do this with faith your reward is certain, as promised in the Bible.

The Devil said to him, "If you are God's Son, order this stone to turn into bread."

But Jesus answered, "The scripture says, "Human beings cannot live on bread alone
-- Luke 4:3-4.
                                                  c
This is more evidence that if you live by the word of God, JEHOVAH, and practice it you will
succeed.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. -- Luke 21:33.

The word JEHOVAH, the eternal, defines ONE WORD and ONE NAME of the ONE GOD
which is fixed and permanent. It was powerful and worked miracles in the old days and is just as
powerful and will work miracles today, if you believe and put it into action. You can test it for
yourself and, by following the laws and rules written in the Bible, prove, get results and learn
that it works today.

The MAGIC WORD will bring you a realization of all your desires.
"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
"Ask and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."

The aim of this book is to prove the value of the Magic Word by the Bible, and not to give the
writer's opinion or the writer's rules. You can obtain results and prove to yourself that these
divine laws work. My objective is to prove to you what the sacred name and divine word is and
give you the evidence of what can be accomplished through sound and song, and how to use the
Magic Word, JEHOVAH, to obtain health, happiness and prosperity.

Under each subject we have quoted the verses proving it. Under the name and word we have
shown Bible proof of the Magic Word, JEHOVAH. We have given the same proof for fasting,
healing, praying, sound, song, singing, thinking and meditation. The reason for this is to prove to
you that everything is in the Bible for you to use to obtain all the aims and objectives through life
by working through the divine word, JEHOVAH.

Among the best books of the Bible to read are: Psalms, Proverbs and Songs of Solomon, but you
should use a Bible with a concordance and read everything under faith, fasting, love, prayer,
spirit, truth, peace, forgiveness, anger, jealousy, hate, evil thoughts, money, prosperity, sacrifice,
selfishness, self-denial, charity and patience.

The Bible is the greatest book ever written and contains the truth and the solution to all your
problems. When you learn, understand, obey and apply the laws revealed in the Bible, you can
overcome all your troubles, physical as well as financial. Let us pay reverence to this great Book
and proceed to seek the light which will lead us out of darkness and eradicate fear, and give us
faith, hope and confidence, based on the knowledge of the law: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap."

How can truth and knowledge eliminate fear and make us free? When we are possessed with
fear, doubt and worry, we waste our energy by retarding and limiting our possibilities of
obtaining our desires. We fear and worry because we do not know. When we need money, we
worry and fear that we will not get it. When we are sick, we fear that we will not get well. But
when we have knowledge of the divine law of supply and demand and know how to draw upon
the universal laws which supply all our desires, then are we free from fear and worry. Therefore,
let us proceed with an open mind to face and seek the truth, the divine law and the magic word of
power; find it and be free.



                                                  d
Knock at the door of knowledge, believing that it will be opened to you and don't stop seeking
and knocking until you have received. THE MAGIC WORD will teach you the law. Obey the
law and nothing will be impossible. But, do not overlook the fact that you cannot get something
good for nothing and that what is worth having is worth praying and working for; only your own
returns to you; you must give to receive. Everything is yours if you pay the price for it, so after
you know how to use the MAGIC WORD, you must work for the desired results. To work
without faith and knowledge of the Divine Law and the MAGIC WORD will not get results. You
must know what you want; know the divine law whereby you can get it, obey the law; have
patience and work until you succeed.

Start to read this course of instructions with the faith that there is no limit to the divine power of
the MAGIC WORD and realize that you are a part of the divine creative power and will find
your Master in yourself. Your Master's voice will be heard through the MAGIC WORD. Then
sickness, poverty, doubt, worry, fear, envy, jealousy and death will disappear. You will find what
you have been seeking. Your heart will be filled with joy, and your life with love and happiness
through the light and use of the MAGIC WORD.

            HISTORY OF THE MAGIC WORD,
                  OR LOST WORD
Long before the pyramids of Egypt, men sought the "Philosopher's Stone," a magic stone by
which he might turn all metals into gold. Likewise, men have sought the Lost Word, the
possession of which they believed would give them all power and bring them all good things in
life to help them gain money, happiness and financial independence.

In ancient times it was generally believed that the Jews possessed the WORD but that they in
some way lost it.

An almost life-long search for the Lost Word was made by Reuchlin of Germany. Pico Della
Mirondola, in Italy, devoted his lifetime to a search for the Lost Word.

Refer to Amos 8:12: -- "People will wander from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean and then on
around from the north to the east. They will look everywhere for a message from the Lord, but
they will not find it." This is further proof that there was a word which was secret for a time and
those who did not use it in the right way were not permitted to know it.

The fact that men have sought so long to find the Lost Word proved that there must have been a
Word of Power in the past. Otherwise, men would not have spent a lifetime trying to find it. If
there is some good proof or evidence from past history that such a word existed and was lost --
probably through the fall or disobedience of man -- then it certainly exists today. If it does, it has
just as great power today as it ever had before it was lost.

The Bible tells what the Divine Word of Power is. The purpose of this book is to show you how
to find and use the word of power or the Magic Word.

Certain lodges and orders have been organized to seek the Lost Word. Today many lodges have
passwords and secret codes, and often use the Master's Word, the Spoken Word, the Word of the
Law and the Word of Power.

                             Chapter II
                        THE WORD JEHOVAH
 In Psalms 68:4 we are told to sing praises unto his name, by his name JAH and rejoice before
him. The name Jah is an abbreviation for Jehovah and you can use the name Jah, or sound this
name instead of Jehovah. In some instances you may get just as good results as you would by
using the full name Jehovah, for in the same way you will get results by using the name Jesus,
the name God, Israel or Immanuel, all depending upon the keynote, or musical sound or tone,
that will start the proper vibrations in your body to produce harmony.

John 15:3. THE SPOKEN WORD IS VERY IMPORTANT. Some people cannot heal
themselves by speaking the word to themselves, but when they hear others speak it, they learn
from them and have faith in others while they do not have faith in themselves.

John 15:7.
If you understand the Magic Word and know that you have it in you, you can ask what you will
and it will be done for you. Jesus said continue in love for love is the fulfilling of the law.

John 15:11,12,13.
Jesus again commands that we love one another, and stresses the value of love in keeping the
commandments.

John 16:23.
Again a definite promise that whatsoever you ask in His name, you will receive.

John 17:17.
You are again told that you are sanctified through the Word, and that the Word is the truth. Now
you understand why Jesus said, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
God's sacred name and divine word Jehovah is the Magic Word of truth. You will no longer
doubt, fear or hate after you know the truth and speak the Word, for knowing the truth and
speaking the Word will make you free.

I Corinthians 14:8,9,10.
The 9th verse says, "For ye shall speak into the air." It certainly is plainly written that you must
speak orally, and that you must speak into the air or broadcast your message so that your prayer,
words of desire, or message will be returned to you and fulfilled, just as people who want to sell
something broadcast the message by radio and this is termed "putting it on the air." People hear
the message and buy the goods. Therefore, their prayer or message is answered through putting it
on the air, and you must follow God's command, and put your message into the air, and
confidentially expect to receive what you ask for after you repeat the word JEHOVAH.

Meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord means breathing in the air or
speaking into the air and meeting the Lord, because the word Lord means JEHOVAH. Then
when you repeat the word JEHOVAH, the Magic Word, your message goes into the air and you
have met the Lord in the air, and if you continue to speak the Word into the air you can expect
the Word to be returned to you, fulfilled.

We read in God's Word that he will give to us according to our work; that he will bless those
who keep his commandments. He admonishes us to reverence His name, pray in silence and not
to talk too much. When you talk too much you give out your energy, your strength and your

                                                 3
secrets. The ancients claimed that what you retained for your own must be kept within yourself.
There is an old saying that a thing talked about continually never happens. People who talk
much, or make plans but never execute them, do not get any results. You will accomplish more
by silently working with the Word and obeying the law.

I Corinthians 1:5.
The meaning of this is that by speaking the right word orally you are benefited. However, saying
the Word in private, not public, will bring the best results.

Numbers 11:23.
This is further proof of the power of God's Word and the promise that the Word will come to
pass for you if you will obey and practice it. There is no limit to what God's power can do, when
you learn to practice it with faith there is no limit to what you can accomplish.

Psalms 33:6.
This is further proof that the spoken word or correct breathing is creating. Again in Psalms He
stated: "And it was done, he commanded and it stood fast."

You can learn to command with the Magic Word, JEHOVAH, and all things will be done as you
wish. Remember, you must always give thanks for the blessings you receive and give thanks in
advance when you pray for the blessings you expect to receive.

Acts 11:14.
The words by which you can be saved are, I AM JEHOVAH. These are the Magic Words of
Power.

Luke 4:32.
You must have faith in the Magic Word before it will produce results for you. Jeremiah said,
"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. He shall never suffer the righteous to
be moved."

Psalms 30:2.
The healing power of the Magic Word is hereby demonstrated, and you can speak the Magic
Word and be healed but you must obey all the laws.

Jeremiah 5:15.
Many people often look far away for a thing which is very close to them. The Magic Word is in
your mouth and heart but you must put it into action. You alone must do the work. Praise God's
sacred Word and put your trust in it and have no fear of what outside things and conditions can
do to you. The Word will give you patience and keep you from temptation.

I John 3:23.
This great command covers all and true love, and by the sacred name and words, I AM
JEHOVAH, you can gain eternal life.

John 16:23.
This is a positive statement and puts no limit on the time or place. All you have to do is pray, ask
in faith and speak the sacred name and word, JEHOVAH, and your request will be granted.


                                                 4
Deuteronomy 5:11.
Why do people swear, "By God"? They know it is a word of power and stronger than their own.
Why not swear, "By Smith" or "By Jones"? To curse or condemn why say, "God damn"? God's
Word is a WORD of POWER. The meaning of this is that you must not use the sacred name to
harm others and you must not use it for selfish desires, such as, coveting something that belongs
to another without giving proper value. You, of course, could not and would not use the name of
the Lord in vain if you have love for others, and understand the law that if you harm others you
harm yourself more. Wrong thinking about others is taking the sacred name in vain. I repeat, you
must obey all the laws to get your reward.

Isaiah 7:14.
The name Immanuel means God With Us, or Jesus on the earth with the people teaching, proving
and fulfilling the law. The word Jesus means Saviour and you can repeat the words "Jesus Saves
Me" the same as you can repeat the sacred Magic Words "Jehovah Saves Me." Repeating or
concentrating on either of the names or words will get results.

The Greek form of the name Joshua, or Jeshua, a contraction of Jehoshua, that is, Help of
Jehovah or Saviour. Read Numbers 13:16.

Luke 1:37.
This is another very positive statement with no ifs, ands or buts about it. It shows the great divine
power through the sacred word JEHOVAH. You are a child of God and he said, "THE THINGS
I DO YE SHALL DO AND GREATER THINGS SHALL YOU DO." He also said, "THE
KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS WITHIN YOU," and, "YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE
LIVING GOD, AND GOD IS IN HIS TEMPLE." Being in His temple gives you the power to
call on Him to supply your needs by repeating the Magic Word, JEHOVAH, When you are sick
in mind or body, you should repeat three times a day, for three days, or for seven days, the
following words: "My body is the temple of the living God. In the temple of God there can be no
sickness, only perfect harmony, happiness and love." Speaking the Word, JEHOVAH, makes it
so. Again speak: "The Kingdom of Heaven is within me. In the Kingdom of Heaven there is no
sickness or sorrow, only perfect health, happiness and love." Repeat these words morning, noon
and night, have faith, believe that they are so and that God will make your body perfect and give
your mind peace and ease. Never forget to repeat the words, "Peace, be still and know that I am
God," and repeat God's statement "I will keep Him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
Thee because he trusted me."

Psalms 4:4.
Throughout the Bible we find the command to keep quiet, be peaceful and still. Concentrating
and repeating the Magic Word when you are in bed, quiet and still, will get greater results.

Psalms 5:3.
Psalms 55:17.
These are your instructions for the time to pray, or to pronounce the Magic Word, JEHOVAH,
and it is made plain that you should speak it, and that the Lord will hear and answer your prayer.
The Bible plainly states that there is a time for every purpose under the sun.

Psalms 69:13.
There is no question but that all things must be done at the right time to get the best results and
the acceptable time for you to pray is, of course, when you need things, but if you follow God’s

                                                 5
plan and rule as outlined in the Bible for the hour and place to pray you certainly will get better
results, because in this way you will be obeying the law.

Isaiah 30:7.
This further proves you can get the best results by keeping quiet and sitting still. Concentrating
in peace and quiet gives you power and good results.

Isaiah 30:15.
You must be quiet, concentrate, meditate and silently repeat the Magic Word JEHOVAH or say,
I, JEHOVAH, and repeat, I AM JEHOVAH, AND HE HEARS AND ANSWERS MY CALL.

Lamentations 5:21.
God, through the sacred word JEHOVAH, can renew your mind and body just as well today as
he did in days of old.

We continue to find proof throughout the Bible that miracles are possible today just as they were
in the past. GOD'S LAW IS ETERNAL, IT ALWAYS WAS and IT ALWAYS WILL BE. IT
ALWAYS HAS WORKED AND ALWAYS WILL WORK. You have the power to put that
MAGIC WORD, JEHOVAH, into action and get results.

Luke 21:33.
We need no greater proof than this that God's Word is permanent and its power is just as great
today as it ever was, and you can be saved and healed by it today just as the people were saved
and healed by it when Jesus walked upon this earth.

             Chapter III
THE SACRED NAME AND WORD JEHOVAH
And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by
my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. -- Exodus 6:3.

Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my
strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. -- Isaiah 12:2.

Abraham named that place "The Lord Provides." And even today people say, "On the Lord's
mountain he provides." – Genesis 22:14.

He made you go hungry, and then he gave you manna to eat, food that you and your ancestors
had never eaten before. He did this to teach you that you must not depend on bread alone to
sustain you, but on everything that the Lord says. -- Deuteronomy 8:3.

What a joy it is to find just the right word for the right occasion! -- Proverbs 15:23.

The Sovereign Lord has taught me what to say, so that I can strengthen the weary. Every
morning he makes me eager to hear what he is going to teach me. -- Isaiah 50:4.

"Oh no, sir," answered the officer. "I do not deserve to have you come into my house. Just give
the order, and my servant will get well. -- Matthew 8:8.

Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the
engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
-- James 1:21-22.

YOU MUST BE DOERS OR USERS OF THE DIVINE WORD, JEHOVAH!

The angel asked, "Why do you want to know my name? It is a name of wonder."
-- Judges 13:18.

Although men have spent a lifetime searching for the Magic Word of Power and many of them
have failed to find it, it is made plain in the Bible just what it is.

It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto
us, that we may hear it, and do it?

Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, who shall go over the sea with us, and bring
it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

You must offer them only in the one place that the Lord will choose in the territory of one of
your tribes. Only there are you to offer your sacrifices that are to be burned and do all the other
things that I have commanded you. -- Deuteronomy 12-14.
                                                 8
The reason people have not found the secret word is because they have looked far away for it and
the Bible says the way to find heaven is to look within. The Bible further states that it is very
near, in the mind and heart. You can find it and the way to use it by reading the Bible. It was first
revealed to Moses: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of
God Almighty, but by my name JE-HO-VAH was I not known to them. -- Exodus 6:3.

There must have been a good reason why the sacred name JE-HO-VAH was not revealed before
God himself revealed it to Moses.

The MAGIC WORD is JEHOVAH. For the meaning of the word, we quote from Smith's Bible
Dictionary "JEHOVAH'' (I am; the eternal living one). The scripture appellation of the supreme
being, interpreted as signifying self-derived and permanent existence. The Jews scrupulously
avoided every mention of this name of God, substituting in its stead one or other of the words
with whose proper vowel-points it may happen to be written. This custom, which had its origin
in reverence, was founded upon an erroneous rendering of Leviticus 24:16, from which it was
inferred that the mere utterance of the name constituted a capital offense. According to Jewish
tradition, it was pronounced but once a year, by the high priest on the day of atonement when he
entered the holy of holies; but on this point there is some doubt. When Moses received his
commission to be the deliverer of Israel, the Almighty, who appeared in the burning bush,
communicated to him the name which he should give as the credentials of his mission: 'And God
said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM, (ehyeh asher ehyeh); and He said, Thus shalt thou say unto
the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto you.’ That this passage is intended to indicate the
entymology of Jehovah, as understood by the Hebrews, no one has ventured to doubt. While
Elohim exhibits God displayed in his power as the creator and governor of the physical universe,
the name Jehovah designates his nature as he stands in relation to man, as the only almighty,
true, personal, holy being, a spirit and 'the father of spirits,' Numbers 16:22; comp. John 4:24,
'God is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth,' who revealed
himself to his people, made a covenant with them, and became their lawgiver, and to whom all
honor and worship are due."

There is plenty of evidence in the Bible that the word JEHOVAH means God, the eternal one.
Abraham and Moses built temples, named and dedicated them to JEHOVAH. Refer to Exodus
17:15, And Moses built an alter, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi. Judges 5:24. Then
Gideon built an alter there unto the LORD, and called it JEHOVAN-SHALOM: unto this day it
is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

This alter was an honor to the name JEHOVAH and the name JEHOVAH-SHALOM means
Jehovah is peace or "JEHOVAH the God of Peace." Isaiah 12:2 -- Behold God is my salvation; I
will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
become my salvation." Again, Isaiah 26:4 -- Trust ye the Lord forever: for the Lord JEHOVAH
is everlasting strength.

Psalms 83:18 -- That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most
High over all the earth.

The name JEHOVAH is translated "Lord" over two thousand times in the Bible, which shows
the importance of this Magic Word, which means more than the word "JESUS" of the word
"GOD."


                                                 9
Refer to Exodus 3:13-15 -- And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall
say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? -- And God said moreover unto Moses,
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for
ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. Also refer to Isaiah 42:8 -- I AM the Lord:
that IS my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. --
This is further evidence that "I AM" and "JEHOVAH'' both mean the same, the divine and
eternal.

And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by
my name JEVOVAH was I not known to them. -- Exodus 6:3.

That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the
earth -- Psalms 83:18.

Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my
strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. -- Isaiah 12:2.

And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount
of the Lord it shall be seen -- Genesis 22:14.

And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi. -- Exodus 17:15.

Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is
yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. -- Judges 6:24.

                                          WORD
The Lord told Balaam what to say and sent him back to Balak to give him his message.
-- Numbers 23:5.

Do not add anything to what I command you, and do not take anything away. Obey the
commands of the Lord your God that I have given you. -- Deuteronomy 4:2.

He made you go hungry, and then he gave you manna to eat, food that you and your ancestors
had never eaten before. He did this to teach you that you must not depend on bread alone to
sustain you, but on everything that the Lord says. -- Deuteronomy 8:3.

But Jesus answered, "The scripture says, Human beings cannot live on bread alone, but need
every word that God speaks." -- Matthew 4:4.

Your words will be used to judge you—to declare you either innocent or guilty.
-- Matthew 12:37.

What it says is this: "God's message is near you, on your lips and in your heart" -- that is, the

-- Psalms 119:49.

What a joy it is to find just the right word for the right occasion! -- Proverbs 15:23.

The Lord hates evil thoughts, but he is pleased with friendly words. -- Proverbs 15:26.

Even the relatives of a poor person have no use for him; no wonder he has no friends. No matter
how hard he tries, he cannot win any. -- Proverbs 19:7.

You will vomit up what you have eaten, and all your flattery will be wasted. -- Proverbs 23:8.

An idea well-expressed is like a design of gold, set in silver. -- Proverbs 25:11.

God keeps every promise he makes. He is like a shield for all who seek his protection.
-- Proverbs 30:5.

God will destroy those who slander others, those who prevent the punishment of criminals, and
those who tell lies to keep honest people from getting justice. -- Isaiah 29:21.

You are to answer them, "Listen to what the Lord is teaching you! Don't listen to mediums --
what they tell you cannot keep trouble away." -- Isaiah 8:20.

If you wander off the road to the right or the left, you will hear his voice behind you saying,
"Here is the road. Follow it." -- Isaiah 30:21.

Yes, grass withers and flowers fade, but the word of our God endures forever. -- Isaiah 40:8.

The Sovereign Lord has taught me what to say, so that I can strengthen the weary. Every
morning he makes me eager to hear what he is going to teach me. -- Isaiah 50:4.

Look up at the heavens; look at the earth! The heavens will disappear like smoke; the earth will
wear out like old clothing, and all its people will die like flies. But the deliverance I bring will
last forever; my victory will be final. -- Isaiah 51:16.

And I make a covenant with you: I have given you my power and my teachings to be yours
forever, and from now on you are to obey me and teach your children and your descendants to
obey me for all time to come. -- Isaiah 59:21.

They have said that the prophets are nothing but windbags and that they have no message from
the Lord. -- Jeremiah 5:13.

                                                 11
The Lord God Almighty said to me, "Jeremiah, because these people have said such things, I will
make my words like a fire in your mouth. The people will be like wood, and the fire will burn
them up." -- Jeremiah 5:14.

Stop believing those deceitful words, "We are safe! This is the Lord's Temple, this is the Lord's
Temple, this is the Lord's Temple! -- Jeremiah 7:4.

We refuse to listen to what you have told us in the name of the Lord. -- Jeremiah 44:16.

"Oh no, sir," answered the officer. "I do not deserve to have you come into my house. Just give
the order, and my servant will get well. -- Matthew 8:8.

man was a prophet and was considered by God and by all the people to be powerful in
everything he said and did. -- Luke 24:19.

They were all well impressed with him and marveled at the eloquent words that he spoke. They
said, "Isn't he the son of Joseph?" -- Luke 4:22.

Everything you do or say, then, should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks
through him to God the Father. -- Colossians 3:17.

message, you heard it and accepted it, not as a message from human beings but as God's
message, which indeed it is. For God is at work in you who believe. -- I Thessalonians 2:13.

                       Chapter IV
                 WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES
"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."

The Bible is a book of laws; physical, natural, mental, spiritual and time laws.

The Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses.
Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the
penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.

The Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are
here on this earth. Jesus said, "As ye sow, also shall ye reap." He did not say "after death" but
here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and
wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something
practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they
want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.

All natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and
got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says
these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.

                                  Sowing and Reaping
Man's laws are not natural laws or divine laws.

When you plant or sow, you cultivate and then you reap. For instance, you plant wheat seeds,
give them water and sunshine, and when the seeds come up, you cultivate them; the wheat grows
and you reap wheat, not corn. This is a natural law, but it is a divine law because you cannot
change it. It has always worked, and it always will work.

The same law governs your acts, thoughts and deeds. What you concentrate or think about you
will reap according to the thoughts you send out. If you concentrate on money and work to get it,
you will get money.

Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
-- Gal. 6:7.

Nothing in the Bible is plainer than this. It is a natural law of cause and effect, -- that everything
brings forth after its own kind. If you think right, act right and do right, your reward is sure. If
you break the commandments and the law and do evil, your punishment is sure.

So the earth produced all kinds of plants, and God was pleased with what he saw.
-- Genesis 1:12.




                                                  21
Again we find a definite statement that everything brings forth after its kind. The fruit you reap is
exactly the same as the seed you sow. So, too, you must expect to reap from thoughts, acts and
deeds exactly as you have sown.

Today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse; a blessing, if you obey the
commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today; but a curse, if you disobey these
commands and turn away to worship other gods that you have never worshiped before. --
Deuteronomy 11:26-28.

Again it is made plain that a reward will come to you for every good deed, no matter how small.
The divine law never fails to pay off. Yon will find it helpful to read over all the Bible quotations
on sowing and reaping.
                                  Power of the Word
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
-- John 1:1.

By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his
mouth. For he spoke, and it was done; He commanded and it stood fast. -- Psalms 33: 6,9.

The Bible teaches that there is power in the Word. God spoke the Word, commanding, "Let there
be light" and there was light.

The Bible says that we are saved by the Word -- so when you learn the Word and how to use it,
you will have unlimited power.




                                                 22
                 Chapter V
      HOW TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS BY
               DIVINE LAWS
                                Visualize and Imagine
And he said, "Now then, these are all one people and they speak one language; this is just the
beginning of what they are going to do. Soon they will be able to do anything they want!
-- Genesis 11:6.

The Bible makes it plain that whatever you imagine, you can do. If you cannot make a mental
picture of a thing you cannot create it. Everything that is accomplished must go through three
processes. When a great artist starts to paint a picture he must first visualize or imagine just what
he intends to paint. He has to really see the perfected picture. Then, he gets the material and
paints the picture, which is a realization of his vision or imagination.

When an architect gets ready to draw the plans for a building he first has the picture of the
building in his mind. Next, he makes the drawings for the building, and the third step is for the
workers to erect the building. When this is completed the original vision or imagination becomes
real.

If you can visualize or imagine, or think yourself into being sick, you can just as easily vision or
imagine yourself into being perfectly well. The greater vision and imagination that anyone has,
the greater success they can make of themselves. People are often called dreamers, but if you can
imagine and visualize a thing you can make dreams come true. That is why it is so important to
meditate and concentrate on whatever problem you wish to solve. If you cannot see yourself
happy, healthy and successful, then you cannot become happy, healthy and successful.

Read everything in the Bible under visions and imaginations and you will see the wisdom of
making the mental picture of the thing you desire.

Then the Lord God said, "Now these human beings have become like one of us and have
knowledge of what is good and what is bad. They must not be allowed to take fruit from the tree
that gives life, eat it, and live forever." -- Genesis 3:22.

Now, go! I will help you to speak, and I will tell you what to say. -- Exodus 4:12.

The Lord said to Moses, "Now I am going to cause food to rain down from the sky for all of you.
The people must go out every day and gather enough for that day. In this way I can test them to
find out if they will follow my instructions.

Moses said, "The Lord has commanded us to save some manna, to be kept for our descendants,
so that they can see the food which he gave us to eat in the desert when he brought us out of
Egypt -- Exodus 16:4,32.



                                                 23
He must take a bath in a holy place and put on his own clothes. After that, he shall go out and
offer the burnt offering to remove his own sins and those of the people. -- Leviticus 16:24.

Do not hand over any of your children to be used in the worship of the god Molech, because that
would bring disgrace on the name of God, the Lord. -- Leviticus 18:21.

There are seven things that the Lord hates and cannot tolerate: A proud look; a lying tongue;
hands that kill innocent people; a mind that thinks up wicked plans; feet that hurry off to do evil;
a witness who tells one lie after another; and someone who stirs up trouble among friends. --
Proverbs 6:16-19.
                          Wisdom and Power of Spirit
Joshua son of Nun was filled with wisdom, because Moses had appointed him to be his
successor. The people of Israel obeyed Joshua and kept the commands that the Lord had given
them through Moses. -- Deuteronomy 34.9.

Tell the priests carrying the Covenant Box that when they reach the river, they must wade in and
stand near the bank.

Then Joshua said to the people, Come here and listen to what the Lord your God has to say.
-- Joshua 3:8-9.

God's spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the Temple. There near the gate I saw
twenty-five men, including Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, two leaders of
the nation. -- Ezekiel 11:1.

I will give you a new heart and a new mind. I will take away your stubborn heart of stone and
give you an obedient heart. -- Ezekiel 36:26.

Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
saying, Not by might, or by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. -- Zechariah 4:6.

He answered, These are the four winds; they have just come from the presence of the Lord of all
the earth. -- Zechariah 6:5.

He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair. Then in this vision God's
spirit lifted me high in the air and took me to Jerusalem. He took me to the inner entrance of the
north gate of the Temple, where there was an idol that was an outrage to God. -- Ezekiel 8:3.

                                   Anger and Wrath
If you become angry, do not let your anger lead you into sin, and do not stay angry all day. --
Ephesians 4:26.




                                                24
                                              Fear

-- Mark 4:40.

Jesus said to her, "My daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of
your trouble.” -- Mark 5:34.

There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out all fear. So then, love has not been made perfect
in anyone who is afraid, because fear has to do with punishment.

We love because God first loved us. -- I John 4:18-19

                                    Death Overcome
He will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, no more grief or crying
or pain. The old things have disappeared. -- Revelation 21:4.

                    Renew the Body Through the Mind
Some people think that a certain day is more important than other days, while others think that
all days are the same. We each should firmly make up our own minds. -- Romans 14:5.

And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness, and true holiness.

Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members
one of another.

Bring us back to you, Lord! Bring us back! Restore our ancient glory. -- Lamentations 5:21.

                                         One Mind

                               Think Right Thoughts

is. -- Proverbs 23:7.

If your goals are good, you will be respected, but if you are looking for trouble, that is what you
will get. -- Proverbs 11:27.

People who set traps for others get caught themselves. People who start landslides get crushed.
-- Proverbs 26:27.
                               Music or Sound Cures

they do succeeds; -- Job 5:12.

Do for others just what you want them to do for you. -- Luke 6:31.

                         Kingdom of God Within You
How can God's temple come to terms with pagan idols? For we are the temple of the living God!
As God himself has said, "I will make my home with my people and live among them; I will be
their God, and they shall be my people." -- II Corinthians 6:16.

                                                26

-- Luke 17:21.

                             Ask in Faith and Receive
And so I say to you: Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will
be opened to you.

For those who ask will receive, and those who seek will find, and the door will be opened to
anyone who knocks. -- Luke 11:9,10.

                                        False Pride
Your pride has deceived you. Your capital is a fortress of solid rock; your home is high in the
mountains, and so you say to yourself, "Who can ever pull me down?

Even though you make your home as high as an eagle's nest, so that it seems to be among the
stars, yet I will pull you down. -- Obadiah 1:3-4.

                                     Prove the Law

Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all
your mind.”

This is the greatest and the most important commandment.

The second most important commandment is like it: "Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”

The whole Law of Moses and the teachings of the prophets depend on these two
commandments." -- Matthew 22:37-40.
The commandments, "Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not desire
what belongs to someone else"—all these, and any others besides, are summed up in the one
command, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." -- Romans 13:9.

If you love others, you will never do them wrong; to love, then, is to obey the whole Law.

Instead, we should all please other believers for their own good, in order to build them up in the
faith.

For Christ did not please himself. Instead, as the scripture says, "The insults which are hurled at
you have fallen on me. -- Romans 15:2,3.

-- Romans 13:10.

"The spark of love gives more light than the universe of truth; yet truth is in love, and in order to
act the truth, you must make love the truth, for remember that the handshake of friendship, or the
kiss and love of an innocent child, will do more to lift a soul to the light than the strongest and
wisest argument even when tightly understood.




                                                 32
Beyond the boundaries of love no thought ever passed for love is where there is everywhere.
Love is a prophecy of freedom, and its song of melody is heard in the rhythmic motion of the
ocean.

"Each 'fowl of the air,' each fish in the sea, and every living thing that moveth upon the earth' is
the manifestation of love, for in their subsistence love has said, 'AS I CREATE SO I PROVIDE.'
Thus in every conceivable thing with form or without, with harmony or with discord - there love
is manifested.”

"Love is the life of every plant, of every sunset, of every soul. It is the inspiration in the happy
mind, and the voice that speaks to us in the time of temptation.”

"Love is the foundation of all understanding, it transcends all reasoning, for it is the fulfillment
of the greatest.”

"Love gives faith to all things, for love believeth in its own.”

"Love symbolizes the everlasting, for it is the spirit of the beginning, and its wonderful radiance
of color decks each sunrise and sunset.”

"Love is the breeze that blows away the clouds of doubt making the landscape of the soul radiant
with joy and gladness. Each heart keeps time in unison to the rhythmic harmonies of love, for
each is Love in All.”

"Love has thrown into the shapeless void the breath that has given life to worlds and this viral
spark or the life of man, illuminates the picture that love has painted."

-- Author unknown.

For the whole Law is summed up in one commandment: "Love your neighbor as you love
yourself." -- Galatians. 5:14.

When you truly love the divine lawgiver and are willing to obey His command then you will
love Him and love everyone else. When your heart is filled with love you cannot hate for love
drives hate away. When you love and have knowledge of the Magic Word, Jehovah, you do not
doubt. When you love you are not selfish, envious or jealous.

Paul says, "Faith, hope and love. The greatest of these is love."

                                    Healing and Faith
Jesus heard them and answered, "People who are well do not need a doctor, but only those who
are sick. -- Matthew 9:12.

When Jesus had gone indoors, the two blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you
believe that I can heal you?" "Yes, sir!" they answered. -- Matthew 9:28.

And their sight was restored. Jesus spoke sternly to them, "Don't tell this to anyone!"
-- Matthew 9:30.
                                                33
So do not be afraid of people. Whatever is now covered up will be uncovered, and every secret
will be made known. -- Matthew 10:26.

What I am telling you in the dark you must repeat in broad daylight, and what you have heard in
private you must announce from the housetops. -- Matthew 10:27.

When they came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to ask if you are the one he said
was going to come, or should we expect someone else?"

At that very time Jesus healed many people from their sicknesses, diseases, and evil spirits, and
gave sight to many blind people.

How happy are those who have no doubts about me. -- Luke 7:20,21,23.

                         Sacred Word Raised the Dead
Yet when he received the news that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more
days.

When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days before.

Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,

But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask him for.

After Martha said this, she went back and called her sister Mary privately. "The Teacher is here,"
she told her, "and is asking for you."

After he had said this, he called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
-- John 11:6,17,18,22,28,43.

Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, the man he had raised
from death. -- John 12:1.
                                       What is God
God is Spirit, and only by the power of his Spirit can people worship him as he really is.
-- John 4:24.

And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an
hungred, he, and they that were with him? -- Mark 2:25.

                                   Prayer and Fasting

He said, "Tell the people of the land and the priests that when they fasted and mourned in the
fifth and seventh months during these seventy years, it was not in honor of me. – Zechariah 7:5.


                                                34
After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive the spirit
out?"

"Only prayer can drive this kind out," answered Jesus; "nothing else can." -- Mark 9:28-29.

I assure you that whoever tells this hill to get up and throw itself in the sea and does not doubt in
his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.

For this reason I tell you: When you pray and ask for something, believe that you have received
it, and you will be given whatever you ask for.

And when you stand and pray, forgive anything you may have against anyone, so that your
Father in heaven will forgive the wrongs you have done. -- Mark 11:23-25.

Some Pharisees and some teachers of the Law who belonged to their group complained to Jesus'
disciples. "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other outcasts?" they asked?

Jesus answered them, "People who are well do not need a doctor, but only those who are sick. I
have not come to call respectable people to repent, but outcasts." Some people said to Jesus,
"The disciples of John fast frequently and offer prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the
same; but your disciples eat and drink."

Jesus answered, "Do you think you can make the guests at a wedding party go without food as
long as the bridegroom is with them? Of course not! -- Luke 5:30-34.

                                   Prayers Answered
Elijah was the same kind of person as we are. He prayed earnestly that there would be no rain,
and no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.

Once again he prayed, and the sky poured out its rain and the earth produced its crops.
-- James 5:17,18.

Give yourself to the Lord; trust in him, and he will help you. -- Psalms 37:5.

God does all this again and again; -- Job 33:29.

You hear my voice in the morning; at sunrise I offer my prayer and wait for your answer.
-- Psalms 5:3.
                            Give and Receive Blessings
Bring the full amount of your tithes to the Temple, so that there will be plenty of food there. Put
me to the test and you will see that I will open the windows of heaven and pour out on you in
abundance all kinds of good things. -- Malachi 3:10.


Instead, store up riches for yourselves in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and
robbers cannot break in and steal. -- Matthew 6:20.
                                               35
For your heart will always be where your riches are. -- Matthew 6:21.

                  Listen to the Spirit and Overcome Evil
If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! To those who win the
victory I will give the right to eat the fruit of the tree of life that grows in the Garden of God.

If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! Those who win the victory
will not be hurt by the second death.

If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! To those who win the
victory I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give each of them a white stone on
which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.
-- Revelation 2:7,11,17.

I will make those who are victorious pillars in the temple of my God, and they will never leave
it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new
Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from my God. I will also write on them my new
name.

To those who win the victory I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, just as I have
been victorious and now sit by my Father on his throne. -- Revelation 3:12,21.

                                    Fear and Doubt
Most people's problems or troubles arise through fear and doubt. When fear is eliminated most of
the other troubles disappear. Fear is the father of jealousy, selfishness, anger, enmity, hatred and
wrong thinking. When you have no fear most of these other evil thoughts disappear.

At the time of a problem, or any kind of trouble, your first move should be to overcome fear and
doubt. You must supplant fear with faith and hope by the use of the Magic Word, Jehovah.
Negative thoughts must be supplanted by good thoughts. It is just as easy to think about good,
pleasant things as it is to think about the wrong things. Thinking and concentrating on faith and
love, and going to work by vibrating, singing or chanting the Magic Word will prepare you to
solve your problems with God's help, and in the way God wants yon to solve them.

Have faith and know that Jehovah is a Divine Magic Word and can make you free.

Solve and dissolve your problem, by the Magic Word, Jehovah. God did not create fear, doubt or
any evil thing. He does not bring sickness, sorrow or any trouble on you. Your troubles are the
result of your own wrong thinking and doing. You have violated some of the laws, otherwise you
would not have any trouble or serious problems.

                                            Money
This is one of the problems with which many people have to contend. The need for money is
often the result of spending more than your income. When you need money you should

                                                36
concentrate, vibrate, sing or chant the Magic Word, Jehovah, and realize that there is an
abundant supply of money for everyone, and that you, if you are living in obedience to the
Divine Law, are entitled to what you need. When you pray for money, have faith and believe you
are going to receive it. Go to work and do something to get it. After you sound the Magic Word
and ask for what you want you should then form a mental picture of the money coming into your
hands.
                                           Sickness
If you are sick yourself and want to get well you should first visualize yourself as being in
perfect health and realize that good health is normal. You must feel that God did not bring illness
upon you, but that he is ready and willing, through the Magic Word, to make you well. Do not
talk about sickness, talk about being well and feeling well. Start acting that way, believe that you
are enjoying perfect health and you will have it.

                         Helping Others Who Are Sick
When you have a problem of this kind you must pray for those who are sick and visualize them
as being in perfect health. Sound the Magic Word, Jehovah, and when you send your message
for someone else, speak it orally and put the message into the air where it will reach the source of
the divine supply and heal those for whom you are praying. When someone is ill try to get them
to sound the Magic Word and ask for perfect health with the faith that their prayer will be
answered.
                                           Enemies
When you are worried over enemies or opponents the way to solve this problem is to bless them,
pray for some good to come to them, and if you can, do them some favor. Love your enemies,
sound the Magic Word and pray that they may reach an understanding and realize it pays to do
good to everyone. Enemies disappear quickly when you learn to love them. You will then find
that they become your friends.
                                    Family Troubles
This is one of the problems that most everyone has sooner or later, and they are brought on by
fear, doubts, and misunderstandings. They can be solved through the Magic Word, Jehovah, if
you will pray earnestly for understanding yourself, sing and sound the Magic Word and ask that
those of your family in trouble be given proper understanding, then your troubles will disappear.
Do what Jesus would do, pray: "Father forgive them for they know not what they do."

                                  Buying and Selling
When you want to sell a house or buy a house you should bless the one who is going to buy from
you and pray that he will be happy and well satisfied with it. Sound the Magic Word and ask that
only those who will like the house, or whatever you are selling, will come to look, buy and be
happy with it. When you wish to buy something bless the seller and pray that he will have what
you want and that both of you will be satisfied with the deal. Remember, wrong thoughts attract
the wrong kind of people. If you use the Magic Word, Jehovah, and pray, you will attract the
right people.

                                                37
                               Seeking a New Position
When you are out of employment and want to secure a new position broadcast your message
through the Magic Word, Jehovah, and offer good services. Bless the party who is going to
employ you and give thanks in advance for the position because if you have the right kind of
faith you know you are going to get a good position. Hold the thought that you are going to be
happy in the new position and that someone needs your services just as much as you need the
position. The Divine Law tells us that there is always a place for those who render good services.

                              New Home and Changes
This is a problem which often confronts people: Conditions make it necessary to sell or leave an
old home and to make radical changes. I have owned many homes; I have had beautiful homes
which I have loved and enjoyed, but when it became necessary to make a change and sell a home
I did it without any regrets, feeling that the Divine Power would bring me a new home which I
would like better and in nearly every instance I acquired a home that was better than the one I
had sold. I prayed that the people who bought my old home would be just as happy as I had been
living in it. I blessed the home and left it with love, looking forward with love for the new home.

When you find it necessary to make a change vibrate the Magic Word and pray that it is all for
the best and that God's will be done, and not yours. There is nothing better than having faith and
looking forward with confidence. When you have the proper faith you can work, visualize your
problem and solve it through the Magic Word, Jehovah.

                                             Worry
Worry comes through fear, doubt and lack of faith. You never solved a problem by worrying and
you never will. Worry takes your energy and strength. Do everything you know to do to
overcome worry. Instead of thinking the worst is going to happen think of love, faith and all
good things, and sound the Magic Word believing that you can solve your problem by a hopeful
attitude with positive thoughts. It is just as easy to think positive thoughts as it is to think nega-
tive thoughts which bring worry.

                            How to Produce Harmony
Harmony in mind and body is all important and you must get in tune with the infinite power. It is
the writer's opinion, based upon years of experience, that the Magic Word, Jehovah, will get
better results than any other word, however, there are many other words and sounds which will
help different people. You can vibrate, chant, sing or hum, OH HO, AH HA, AUM OM, MOM,
LOVE, LIVE, ELOHIM, JAH or DO RE MI. Any of these that will put you in tune and produce
harmony are good to use. You must get your chord or keynote and this will put your mind and
body in harmony. Find the kind of music that you like, get phonograph records and listen to
them. The kind of music that will soothe you, and put you to sleep is the best for you. When you
become quiet and feel that you can drop off to sleep sound the Magic Word, Jehovah, and you
will get good results.


                                                 38
WORK: Many people do not know when they have troubles, or misfortunes, that if they go to
work at something the problem is soon solved and the troubles disappear. You can help to solve
your problem by putting the Magic Word into action while you work. Often when you work at
something which you do not like, or clean up a difficult job, it helps you because it relieves your
mind. The mind, like the body, must be kept free and clean in order to be active and function at
its best.

PRAY FOR WHAT YOU NEED: Many people do not know how to pray. They pray for things
they want and not for just what they need, God knows best and will give you what you need.
You may think you want something which God may think not best for you. I know of a man who
solved all his financial problems by getting his wife to agree to buy only what they needed and
not everything they wanted when his salary check came in every month. The result was that he
got out of debt and accumulated considerable property, and had an income sufficient for all his
and her needs. He said to me, "My wife and I could have spent all my salary check every month
for all the things we wanted but we could get along without these things. If we had spent the
entire salary check for the things we desired we would never have been out of debt."

I knew a man in Wall Street who by working hard, studying and applying the right rules made
more than a million dollars in the stock market. He thought he wanted two or three million,
although he did not need the one million which he acquired. The result was that in trying to get
more money which he did not need he lost the one million which he had. Then he had to go to
work, starting from scratch, and found that when he bought only what he needed he could get
along without the one million. If he had used the natural law and followed the Divine Law and
practiced the Magic Word, Jehovah, he would have found peace, happiness and contentment had
he not tried to make money too fast.

HAVING YOUR OWN WAY: Many people have wrecked their lives and brought failure and
misfortune upon themselves by insisting upon having their own way. This is stubbornness and
should be overcome. How do you know that your way is the right way? Follow the Divine Law
and do things God's way. I knew of two sisters who inherited a home which cost over three
hundred thousand dollars. The house was too large for their needs and they had no use for it,
neither did they have the money to maintain a home of this size. It was too large for most any
family and no one would buy it for a home. An institution offered them $125,000 for this house.
They refused to sell. Later they needed to sell badly and received an offer of $75,000 which they
also refused because they had been offered $125,000 and said that they would not sell unless
they got $125,000. They had decided to have it their way and to not accept a price they had been
offered. Years later they were unable to pay the taxes, the house was sold and they were evicted,
thereby losing the house because they wanted a price that suited their way. Had they prayed for
Divine guidance a message would have come to them to accept $125,000 for a home which they
could not use nor keep up.

I have talked with many men and women who have told me what happened to them when they
tried to have things their own way, and in later years they found out their way was the wrong
way, but it was too late, after they had suffered disappointment and misfortune. How often we
hear people say, after someone has done them an injury, "I'll get even with that person if it takes
me all my life." That is having things their way and they suffer for years trying to get even when
forgiveness and returning good for evil would have brought them happiness and saved a lot of
trouble and anxiety. The Divine Laws are perfect and you will make no mistake in following
them. Change your mind and change your ways. Sing and sound the Magic Word, Jehovah,

                                                39
which will put your mind and body in harmony and bring you peace and happiness.

LOOKING BACKWARD: It has been said that looking backward brings nothing but regrets. If
you have had misfortune and disappointment it will do you no good to dwell upon them. Christ,
said, "Let the deadpast bury the dead." By this he meant not to drag your mistakes and
misfortunes of the past into the future. Face the future with faith and hope, forget the past and
you will solve your problem. Remember what happened to Lot's wife. She looked back and
turned into a pillar of salt. This means that she lived in the past, therefore, made no progress and
did not move forward more than a pillar of salt could move forward under its own power. You
can't do anything about the past, but you certainly can take care of the future by making it better
than the past through the use of the Magic Word and the Divine Law.

HATRED, ANGER, JEALOUSY, DOUBT AND ENMITY: All these things hinder your
progress and can never do you any good. The sooner you eliminate them the sooner you will
realize that you have solved your problems and that your problems will be answered. Just read in
the Bible what is said about all of these things and how they mar your progress and happiness. It
has been said, "Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad." An angry man has bad
judgment, he will act wrong and act against his own best interests. The Bible says, "Let not your
angry passions rise, and not let the sun go down upon your wrath." The reason for this is: Going
to bed at night without forgiving someone, whom you think has wronged you, leaves a burden
upon your mind which will prevent peaceful sleep and interfere with your progress in every way.
After you fully understand the Divine Law you will supplant hatred, anger, jealousy, doubt and
enmity with love. This is the fulfilling of the law and will help you to live in harmony. You
cannot expect peace and happiness, or accomplish your desires and get what you want, unless
you have removed from your mind and heart all of these things which interfere with your
progress. There is no use applying the Magic Word, Jehovah, chanting or singing it, until you
have a clean mind, a clean heart and a clean body.

LOVE: Look up the concordance in the Bible and read everything on love. You will learn that it
is the most important thing in life. If you love your neighbour and your fellowmen you will find
happiness. It is, indeed, the greatest thing on earth. God's great love for His people caused Him
to sacrifice His only son that they might know and understand the law of love and follow His
example. It is the greatest power on earth. Men go to war and lose their lives for the love of their
country. A mother will sacrifice everything she has on earth for a prodical, worthless son
because she loves him. Why does the Bible say to love those that hate you and to return good for
evil? It is because giving love for hatred is obeying the Divine Law and your reward is certain.
Did anyone ever get a reward by hating someone? When you can return good for evil you have
reached the stage where yon can make the divine Magic Word work, solve all your problems and
accomplish all your desires. When you are in perfect harmony through the law of love all good
things will flow to you.

FORGIVENESS: The Bible makes it plain that we must forgive others if we expect forgiveness
ourselves. Every night before you go to sleep you should ask forgiveness for any wrong you
might have done anyone and pray for blessings on those you think have wronged you. If you can
do this, love is flowing through your mind and heart and you are on the right road. Many men
and women have wrecked their lives became they could not forgive and forget. How much better
it is to forgive quickly and bless the other person even if he should be wrong. It brings freedom
and happiness to you.


                                                40
CONFESSION: The Bible makes it strong that you should confess your sins and errors. You
will make greater progress if you confess orally. If you have no one to whom you can talk, go
into the open, in a quiet place, speak in a quiet voice and confess your mistakes. Get them out of
your system. Another good way is to write on paper all the mistakes you have made or anything
that is troubling you. Burn the paper and you are free. After this repeat the Magic Word and
make your prayers. You will sleep better, have better health and find that your problems soon
will be solved.

SHORT CIRCUIT IN MIND AND BODY: How often have you pressed a button to turn on an
electric light and found that the light did not come on? If, on examination, you found the circuit
was on then you knew there was a short circuit leading to the light bulb. When this short circuit
was removed the light came on. This is what happens to your mind when you are thinking wrong
thoughts, such as, hatred, anger, jealoousy, doubt and enmity. This produces a short circuit in
your mind which affects the body and you will not be well, happy nor successful until you
remove the short circuit. This you can do by right thinking and supplanting the other evil
thoughts with love and good thoughts. By putting good thoughts into action and doing something
good for someone else you put your own mind and body in harmony and the short circuit
disappears. By singing, chanting and humming the Magic Word, Jehovah, you can produce
harmony in mind and body.

CONFUSION AND CONCENTRATION: The Bible has much to say about confusion. No one
can concentrate and meditate and get good results when the mind is confused. You cannot think
about two things at the same time, nor can you do two things successfully at the same time. If
you are thinking about some misfortune, or some wrong someone has done you, you cannot
meditate or concentrate and get yourself in harmony with the perfect Divine Law. The way to
overcome confusion is to get quiet and still, and repeat the Magic Word, Jehovah, until there is
no confusion, then whatever was disturbing your mind will have disappeared.

MEDITATION AND MENTAL PICTURE: You should always meditate quietly and alone,
where there are no distractions. Think about what you want and what you need. Ask for ideas
and for guidance.

Try to see a realization or a picture of what you have asked for, and see the fulfillment of what
you pray for. Suppose you need money and you have prayed for money, you bless the money
that is coming and give thanks for it in advance. Picture the money as being already in your
hands and bless it.

When you spend money or give it away, give your blessings with it. If you do not give willingly,
and with a blessing that the money will be of benefit to the receiver, it is better that you do not
give it. When you are going to give something to someone do not say, "I will do this, but I
cannot afford it." When you give, give freely and willingly. Than say, "I know that the Divine
supply is unlimited and what I need will come to me in due time."

THANKSGIVING AND GIVING: Following the example set by the Pilgrim Fathers we have a
day set aside each year for giving thanks to Almighty God for his blessings. This is wonderful
and as it should be. We will all be better off and happier if we give thanks every day for what we
have received and for what we are about to receive. The more often we give thanks and send out
blessings the more good things will return to us. When you are despondent and think you have a
lot of troubles and misfortunes, sit down and write out all the blessings you have received

                                                41
throughout life. They will so far overbalance your seeming troubles and misfortunes that you
will feel like giving thanks instead of feeling sorry for yourself, and lamenting your condition.
Many so-called misfortunes are blessings in disguise. I have had this proven many times in my
life.

GIVING THANKS: The Bible teaches us to give thanks day and night. You should give thanks
for everything you have received, bless everyone who has helped you and when you pray for
anything give thanks in advance. Say, "Lord, Jehovah, the Divine Power, I am thankful because I
know my prayer is going to be answered." This is showing your faith and then if you act and
work in accordance with the Divine Law your prayer will be answered. Read everything in the
Bible under praise and giving thanks and you will learn how important it is. No matter how small
a favor someone may do for you, show your appreciation by thanking them. You will feel better
and they will feel better. I have heard people say, I have paid so and so for what he did for me; I
do not owe him any thanks. By refusing to give thanks to the other person and blessing him he
was hurting himself and putting off the good that might come to him. During my life I have had
many employees and always felt that after I had paid them for their work I still owed them
thanks, if their work was satisfactory. I have paid bonuses and given presents to employees after
they rendered me good and satisfactory service. I have always profited by doing this, and found
employees ready and willing to render me more service than I paid for.

God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform. It may take a little time for us to see why
things that have happened are for the best. Giving to others, or to charity of any kind, is a
problem which each individual must solve for himself. The Bible says that 10 per cent of your
income is about the right amount. You certainly owe something to the Lord and his cause after
you have received benefit. You should always try to help those who are trying to help
themselves. Give to people who are in need and not to people who are just asking for something
because they want it. Do not give to beggars because you are encouraging them to continue to try
to get something for nothing. A man once asked Andrew Carnegie to give him 25¢ because he
was hungry. Carnegie answered, "I have never paid a man to beg, but if you really want to work
for money, I will give you a job." The man went to work for Carnegie and made a great success
of himself. When you give money to a drunkard you are harming him and wasting your money.
The Bible says, "Do not cast your pearls before swine." You must know how to give good gifts
and to give them to the right and deserving people.

Neither the government nor individuals owe a living to any man or woman. All people should
ask for or expect is an opportunity to help themselves. If you give them that you have done your
duty and bestowed a good gift.

The Bible says that it is more blessed to give than to receive, but it also says that your gifts must
be for a worthy cause or a worthy purpose.

Many people have the wrong idea about how or where to find God. The Divine Power is always
within you and in the air you breathe. The Magic Word, Jehovah, is always with you to help you
at any time or any place. God can help you whether you are on the water or under the water, in a
submarine. He can reach you in a tunnel under the earth. He can reach you when you are five
miles above the earth in an aeroplane, and he can answer your prayers no matter where you are,
or in any and all conditions. If God could not do this he would not be God and His power would
not be everlasting and divine. Some people have the idea that the only place they can find God is
within the church. This is wrong. God can and will hear and answer your prayers no matter

                                                 42
where you are. There is no limit to Divine Power, and no time or place that it will not work for
you, so long as you are in harmony and are obeying the Divine Law. You are a child of God; you
are born in the image and likeness of your maker and are entitled to everything you need through
obedience to the Divine Law. All you need to learn is how to work and put the Divine Magic
Word, Jehovah, into action, and your prayers will be answered.

                              Chapter VI
                           WORLD PROBLEMS
For thousands of years nations have gone to war and in many instances war has been started just
because some ruler was greedy for power and brought on a war in the hopes of increasing his
power. This ruler never thought of the loss of life or the property of others. It is a well known
fact that after political leaders, kings and dictators get their countries in bad shape financially by
making mistakes and wasting the people's money, they start a war and then try to blame all the
misfortunes of the people on the war. The facts are, they made the mistakes before the war and
they had started the war to cover up their mistakes. In most instances wars are not started to
protect the rights of the people; they are started by one nation wanting to get something for
nothing and trying to gain control of the business and commercial interests of the world. The aim
of that nation being to gain world domination. England started wars to obtain more territory and
at one time she controlled practically all the trade of the world. Every war Germany has fought
has been to further her trade interests and to seek domination. Hitler didn't start a war with
Poland because Poland had done something he didn't like. He started the war to acquire Poland
and other countries and to dominate the commercial business of the world. If this had not been
the case, when he succeeded in defeating Poland, he would have quit. In fact, he said he was
going to quit after he took a certain amount of land from Poland. If Hitler had succeeded in
defeating Russia he would have then crossed the channel to defeat England and, if he had
succeeded there, he would then have tackled the United States, and, if successful, he would have
attacked his ally Japan because, his whole objective was to dominate the business of the world.
Rulers always find something to fight about when they decide they need the business of another
country. Wars never solved a problem. If they did, wars would not continue to be fought every
twenty or thirty years. Nothing has ever been gained by war. The winner loses because the cost
of material, men and money is greater than any possible benefits. If the money that has been
spent on wars during the past two hundred years had been used for constructive purposes no
country would be paying taxes to amount to anything, every desert would blossom like a rose
and the trillions of dollars that have been used for wars could be used for research to overcome
all diseases. People would be happier, healthier and contented in a land of plenty, and poverty
would be unknown.

If every nation on the face of the earth worked as hard and prepared to maintain peace, as it does
to prepare for war, there would be no war. If the rulers of all the countries of the world believed
in God's Divine Law and were willing to follow the Golden Rule, all problems could be settled
without resorting to war.

As soon as World War II ended, in 1945, the United States started spending billions of dollars
getting ready for another war. If we went into this last war to bring an end to wars, and to make
the world safe for democracy, why do we have to start to get ready for another war? This is proof
that wars do not settle any problems.

The United States has never gone to war with the objective of gaining territory, and if we do not
want territory or anything from other countries, why enter war? Why should we develop the
atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb to fight Russia? Our country is making it plain that we are
preparing to fight Russia. Can anyone blame Russia for getting ready to fight a country that is
preparing to fight her? Politicians and political leaders, in order to hold their own jobs which are
the most important things to them, scare the taxpayers into letting them be taxed for money to
                                                  44
start another war. They rule the people through fear. If they ruled through love and
understanding there would be no war. This is the only way the United States and the rest of the
world can solve the problem, and bring about world peace. We have got to stop talking of war
and preparing for war. We must work for peace, pray for peace and follow the Divine command:
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Love those who hate us and try to help instead of fight them. With
the advance in science and modern weapons of war the world cannot stand a third World War.
Civilization will be wiped out. The smartest men we have know this to be a fact. The people
must be aroused and made to realize that they must not support and follow political leaders
whose aim is to lead our whole country into war in order to hold their own jobs. The taxpayer
should be willing to be taxed for money to be used to bring about universal peace, but not for
taxes to start another war which, if we could win, would not solve the problem. If the people
were allowed to vote on war there would be no war. If women were allowed to vote to decide
whether or not there would be another war, they would not vote to send their sons to be
slaughtered. The Divine Law of love must be followed sooner or later. The United States should
take the lead in starting the move for universal peace, and let the world know it does not want to
fight and that war can never permanently settle any problem. If we do this, then we can look
forward to a better world and universal peace.

                      Chapter VII
                BROADCAST YOUR PRAYERS
Radio and Wireless Forecast in the Bible
        Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought:
        and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for
        a bird of the air shall carry the ,voice, and that ,
        which hath wings shall tell the matter. -- Ecclesiastes 10:20.
The bird of the air referred to in this verse is the aeroplane, equipped with radio, flying through
the air without wires or any connection except the sound waves and, equipped to send radio
messages, can direct its message anywhere, to other planes flying in the air, to radio stations or to
ships at sea. Does this not prove what Jesus said, "That greater things than I do, ye shall do."
This was one of the greatest inventions of the world -- wireless and radio -- and it has proved to
be of more benefit to mankind than any other invention.

    HOW DOES THE RADIO WORK WITHOUT WIRES
    AND CARRY MESSAGES IN EVERY DIRECTION?
Radio works as the result of sound waves which once set in motion continue to move and can be
picked up by a radio receiving set tuned into the same wave length. You cannot see these sound
waves, but you know they work. Man no longer needs wires to transmit messages. You can tune
in on different stations of different wave lengths. You can tune off, or tune out stations that you
do not want. Before wireless and radio were invented sound waves had been discovered and
many men knew something about how they traveled, but they had not learned how to record and
receive sound waves until they discovered radio. More proof of what the Bible says, "That
whatever a man imagines, he can do." The man who invented wireless and radio imagined he
could do it, and he did it. This is the greatest proof of the unseen forces being the most powerful.
You cannot see the air waves or sound waves, but you can hear them and you know they work.
You cannot see the Divine force that is in the air, but it is there and all-powerful, and will work
miracles for you if you will have faith and put it into action.

                   PUT YOUR MESSAGE IN THE AIR
If you speak into the air, and speak the Magic Word JEHOVAH, you are broadcasting your
prayers and desires when you say, "I am love, I am Jehovah," or make your demands to Jehovah,
speaking the word through the air. You will get greater results when you sound the Magic Word.
It will start the wave of happiness and prosperity and good health moving toward you. And, what
you send out when you speak the word into the air will return to you. Remember fear and doubt
are the only things which can cause a short circuit in your mind and body, and prevent all good
things from flowing to you. You must supplant fear with faith, and hope is held out with love and
the Magic Word, and Divine power of the Magic Word Jehovah, that you will receive what you
ask for and find happiness in Heaven and here on earth.

The Bible is simple and plain, yet to people who do not understand it in the right way it is
complicated and mysterious. It is simple and easy if you read it correctly and accept it for what it
means.
                                                 47
        FROM WHERE DOES DIVINE POWER COME?
It is not separate nor apart from you, but it is in you and a part of you. The Divine power is what
most people call God. It is everywhere, just like the air is everywhere. You cannot live without
air, and you cannot live without the Divine power which created life. Then you can say, "God is
in the air." That is right. Air is the most important thing, for when God breathed it into Adam, he
became a living being. You breathe the power of the Magic Word, "Jehovah," when you sound
the word, and breathing in air, taking deep breaths, gives you Divine power. Then does this not
prove why the Bible says you cannot see God, and that no one has ever seen Him? You cannot
see the air, but you can feel it, and you know it has great power for construction or destruction,
depending upon how you use it. The eye is deceptive, therefore, when we reason from the
objective of what we see, we are often wrong. The magician proves that the hand is quicker than
the eye, and we believe what the eye sees, but it is often wrong. You can prove this to yourself.
Look down a railroad track until you see the two rails come together. Your eye perceives that
this is true and that the railroad rails do come together, but it is an optical illusion. They do not
come together.

Follow your still small voice, or the overseeing eye, the inner eye, which is in contact with the
Divine power. It is always right. A woman's intuition is always right and she can depend upon it,
but when she reasons from the objective she is wrong. We should all listen to the message from
the Divine power and follow it.

            WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO HAVEN?
The reason people want to go to Heaven is to find peace, quiet and happiness which they have
not found on this earth due to their own fault and failure to understand the Divine power in the
sacred name and Magic Word. Let me make it plain to you. If you cannot find happiness and
contentment on this earth, you will not find it in the world to come as the Bible teaches that you
reap just what you sow and the heaven you go to will be according to your deeds done on this
earth.

Others cannot show you the way to heaven on earth, nor can they find it for you. You have to do
that for yourself. I may be able to show you the right road and the way to find happiness, but you
must have the faith, and do the work yourself. The trouble with most people is, they expect
others to do the work for them. The Divine word, the Magic Word, Jehovah, never promised
that. You must learn the truth, and practice its teachings. Work with the Word. Sound and speak
the Magic Word, Jehovah, which is the way to call the Divine power from the air and get the
answers to your prayers. That is the reason Jesus said: "Ask and you shall receive, knock and it
shall be opened unto you." The Bible tells you the plain truth and you must accept it on faith, be-
lieve it and then prove to yourself by obedience to the law and to the Magic Word, Jehovah.

                                      HEALING
                       Your Most Valuable Possession
Most people, if asked what is their most valuable possession, would answer, money. That is
wrong. Your most valuable possession is TIME. You exchange time for money or something that
you need. Your next valuable possession is good health. Therefore, you should spend some of
your time to keep in good health.

Solomon was credited with being the wisest man who ever lived. He placed knowledge and
understanding above all else. If you use your time in getting knowledge you are putting it to the
best advantage. Money always comes through knowledge. You cannot put knowledge to work
without good health. Many people have deformities, but they overcome these and are able to
make a living because they have learned how to do something despite their infirmities. If you
apply the Magic Word, Jehovah, to all of your problems you will have good health, acquire
knowledge and accumulate money.

We often learn through adversity. People seldom learn when they are prosperous. Nature often
teaches a lesson in the value of good health by putting you flat on your back in the bed, and it is
after suffering an illness that you learn to take care of your health. Misfortunes and adversities
often prove a blessing in disguise. We must learn by past mistakes and not repeat them in the
future. Use the Magic Word and pray for the power to overcome mistakes, and you will succeed.

              The Importance of Correct Deep Breathing
Since air is the most important element that keeps us alive, correct deep breathing is essential to
good health. You can take breathing exercises anywhere and at any time, but you will get the
best results by doing breathing exercises in bed after you are relaxed and quiet.

                                    Twelve Breaths
Every part of your body can be stimulated and helped through correct deep breathing. The
Hindus used three breaths and seven breaths, or breathing three times, resting then repeating
three times, making nine breaths over three consecutive periods.

Twelve breaths are the most valuable because there are twelve organs of the body each of which
need stimulation and building up through proper breathing and upon which you should
concentrate while taking these breaths, and they are:
1.     The head in which are your eyes, ears and nose. Concentrate on these organs while
       inhaling and exhaling your first breath for stimulation of the head and brain which is the
       most important part of the body in acquiring knowledge, good health and all other things.
2.     The throat and other organs of respiration. This breath should be to stimulate them.
3.     The lungs. This breath is the most important as it was used by the Hindus to stimulate the
       lungs, the shoulders and the arms.


                                                57
4.     The stomach. The fourth breath is to stimulate the stomach and aid it in digesting the
       food properly.
5.     The heart. When you practice this breath concentrate on strengthening the heart and
       resting it, also concentrate on very deep breathing to affect your whole circulatory system
       as it is through the proper functioning of the heart that good circulation and distribution
       of the blood depends.
6.     The bowels. Concentrate upon keeping your bowels strong, making them active in order
       to eliminate poisons from your body.
7.     The back and loins. Beginning with the 6th breath think about the solar plexus. When the
       solar plexus is aroused and functions properly it feeds the nerves leading to all other parts
       of the body as it is a large group of nerves serving as your receiving station for the body.
       This should operate smoothly because if there be a short circuit here it impedes tuning in
       on the Divine Power to heal your mind and body, or to ask for all your needs.
8.     The genital organs. Breath to keep these organs strong for recreation or building up of the
       body. The sex forces are not to be wasted in excesses but are to be retained to build a
       strong healthy body.
9.     The hips and thighs. The 9th breath should be concentrated on these.
10.    The knees. By this time you should be breathing very deeply and try to imagine you are
       drawing your breath to the knees. Strong knees enable one to walk—the most popular
       form of exercise.
11.    The calves of the legs, and the leg extending between the knees and ankles, must be well
       preserved to prevent hardening of the arteries.
12.    The feet. The nerve centers terminate in the soles of the feet where the blood reaches the
       greatest extreme and begins its flow back to the heart. Few people realize how important
       it is to exercise the feet and bathe them frequently. If you will read everything in the
       Bible under feet you will find out how vital it is to take proper care of them. Every pore
       of your skin is used for breathing purposes and the soles of the feet have a maximum of
       pores through which your skin breathes. For this reason you should take off your shoes as
       often as possible and let your feet get plenty of fresh air, but it is most important to keep
       them clean.

                                Sun Baths for Health
The Bible tells us that God created the sun to give light by day, and the moon to give light by
night. The ancients worshipped the sun and built pyramids and monuments to the sun, and the
moon. They believed the sun to be God and the giver of life.

The sun gives life to plants, animals and human beings. Nothing can live without it. When heat
leaves the body, the body is dead and no longer active. Compare this to the electric street car
which moves as long as the electric current is on but when the current is cut off the street car
stops, and does not move until the current is again turned on.

Vegetation needs three things to produce growth and they are:
1.     Sun
2.     Water
3.     Earth
The sun or heat is the most important because even though you do plant seeds and water them
they will not germinate without heat which is supplied by the sun.

                                                58
By taking nude sun baths in the open air your skin is stimulated as it absorbs the life giving
elements from the sun to build up a strong body. Electric heat and various electrically operated
lamps can help your body and your skin, but these artificial means cannot compare with the
health-giving rays of the sun on the human body. Sun baths on the seashore where you breathe
the salt air are very beneficial. Nude sun baths always help because all of the pores of the skin
are exposed allowing all the pores to breathe. Deep breathing exercises taken in the open air and
in the sunshine will give you greater benefit.

                              Chapter XI
                           PRAY AND PRAYER
Your prayers are answered through speaking, chanting or humming and vibrating the Magic
Word, Jehovah. You get an answer to your prayers through meditation and concentration, which
should be done in a quiet, peaceful place. Your prayers are answered by positive thoughts and
words, and not by negative thoughts and acts.

When you want good health, talk about good health and think about good health. Remember
your own thoughts and words return to you. You do not want to be sick; why talk about
sickness?

I have known people who constantly talk about their illnesses and troubles, and in so doing they
are keeping their mind on them. The way to get good health is to be positive; think and talk of
good health; have only good thoughts and speak good words of everyone. When you pray and
use the Magic Word you certainly would not pray for illness, you would pray for good health.
Why not, when you do feel a little ill, pray for what you want, which is good health. Follow
Coue's rule: say, "Every day and in every way I am getting better and better." Look in the mirror
every day and say I am looking better, feeling better and looking better. Keep this up and you
will soon see the results. When you pray and sound the Magic Word, Jehovah, ask for what you
want and need. Do not think or talk about what you don't want. The Bible says: As a man
thinketh in his heart so is he. It has also been well said that what a man loves he will become,
God if he loves God, and dust if he loves dust.

If you do not want others to criticize and find fault with you, do not criticize others and find fault
with them. Your own thoughts and words will return to you.

If you want love you must give love, think of love and talk of love. You cannot get love through
hating and by thinking of hating people. Think positive and not negative thoughts.

When you want money concentrate on money. Do not talk about poverty or think about poverty.
Never say, I am poor. This is inviting misfortune on yourself. Make a positive statement by
saying, I am rich in God's love and through the power of the Divine Magic Word I shall be rich
in money. The Divine Power is unlimited, and money and everything I need will flow to me.

                                   Holding a Grudge
This is one of the worst things anyone can do. It poisons the mind and body, creates a short
circuit and your prayers cannot be answered as long as you hold a grudge. That is why the Bible
tells you to return good for evil. The idea of trying to get even with someone because they have
done you a seeming injury is the worst thing you can do. The only way you can get even and get
a return for yourself is to do some good for someone. Then your reward is sure. The Bible says
to transform your body through the renewing of your mind. Your mind is renewed when you
cleanse it of all evil thoughts and give and forgive. Your prayers will then be answered.




                                                 63
When you fall asleep at night repeat the Magic Word, Jehovah, and say: The Divine Word is
doing its work while I sleep; my mind and body is being made perfect. Plenty of sleep and rest is
essential to good health, happiness and prosperity.

While you sleep the Divine Power is opening your mind to unlimited supplies of everything you
need and if you concentrate it will come to you and your prayer will be answered.

Just before you fall asleep say: The Power of the Magic Word, Jehovah, will show me what to do
and how to get everything I need. Then repeat: The Magic Word, Jehovah, saves and protects me
now. I am healed by the Magic Word, Jehovah.

             The Magic Word, Jehovah, Works Wonders
After you have put the Magic Word to the test and proved it as I have, and as thousands of others
have, you will know that it does work wonders.

When you sound the Magic Word, Jehovah, into the air and ask for what you need the sound
waves carry your message throughout the world. The unseen powerful forces which you are in
tune with carry your message and it is received by other minds which are in tune with yours.
This opens the way for you through faith to get all you need and to get an answer to your
prayers. You must pray when you have any difficult problem that you will receive a message on
how to work, and what to do to get an answer to your prayers.

You should repeat: God created everything through the spoken word Jehovah, I can do the same.
The Magic Word, Jehovah, is just as powerful today as it was when God used it in creating
everything and it is just as powerful as it was when Jesus used it to heal the sick. The Magic
Word, Jehovah, is God and the expression of His power. That power never becomes weak
because God is eternal and everlasting. If the word had the power to work one time it has it now
because God has made it plain that it is everlasting and that it does not change. Your prayers will
be answered when you live in obedience to the Divine Law.

THEM TO HEALTH, AND THE SINS THEY HAVE COMMITTED WILL BE FORGIVEN.

SO THEN, CONFESS YOUR SINS TO ONE ANOTHER AND PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER,

                    Chapter XII
           HOW TO USE THE MAGIC WORD,
                    JEHOVAH
Many people do not realize the power and the value in the spoken word, and that by vibrating the
sound of their voice into the air it will return, bring an answer and they will receive what they
ask for. The Bible is full of evidence that Jesus did heal through the spoken word and that God
created everything through the word. There is also evidence that the word was lost and was
found. You may have lost it, or may never have found it, but you can learn how to use it and
realize health, happiness and prosperity, providing that you use the word only for good, and do
not use it in any way to injure others. The Magic Word, Jehovah, must be used for blessing and
not for cursing.

THE LOST WORD: You spoke to me, and I listened to every word. I belong to you, Lord God
Almighty, and so your words filled my heart with joy and happiness. -- Jeremiah 15:16.

Things Created by the Word: The Lord created the heavens by his command, the sun, moon, and
stars by his spoken word. -- Psalms 33.6

When he spoke, the world was created; at his command everything appeared. -- Psalms 33:9.

It is by faith that we understand that the universe was created by God's word, so that what can be
seen was made out of what cannot be seen.

It was faith that kept Enoch from dying. Instead, he was taken up to God, and nobody could find
him, because God had taken him up. The scripture says that before Enoch was taken up, he had
pleased God. -- Hebrews 11:3,5.

For there is nothing that God cannot do. -- Luke 1:37.

For it was by hope that we were saved; but if we see what we hope for, then it is not really hope.
For who of us hopes for something we see?

But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

In the same way the Spirit also comes to help us, weak as we are. For we do not know how we
ought to pray; the Spirit himself pleads with God for us in groans that words cannot express.

In view of all this, what can we say? If God is for us, who can be against us?
-- Romans 8:24,25,26,31.

Why won't God give me what I ask? Why won't he answer my prayer?

What strength do I have to keep on living? Why go on living when I have no hope?
Am I made of stone? Is my body bronze?


                                                71
What strength do I have to keep on living? Why go on living when I have no hope?
-- Job 6:8,11,12,13.

What has happened before will happen again. What has been done before will be done again.
There is nothing new in the whole world

Look," they say, "here is something new!" But no, it has all happened before, long before we
were born. -- Ecclesiastes 1:9,10.

To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:

A time to be born, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;

A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;

A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing;

A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;

A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;

A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. -- Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.

We receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases
him.

What he commands is that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as Christ
commanded us.

Those who obey God's commands live in union with God and God lives in union with them. And
because of the Spirit that God has given us we know that God lives in union with us.
-- I John 3:22-24.

From the above you have the proof from God's Word, the Bible, that there is power in the spoken
word. Nothing changes and what has been will be, what has been done can be done. Jesus said,
"Greater things than these shall ye do." If God created by the spoken word you can create
through the use of the spoken word, and you can reach the universal supply through the Magic
Word, Jehovah, and receive everything you need to supply your wants and demands. There is a
time and place for everything. This is a law laid down in the Bible. There are many references of
going to the mountains to pray, of seeking a quiet, secret, peaceful place in which to pray. You
can do no better than to follow the example in the Bible.

The Bible tells us that God is a spirit and that you meet God in the air. This is the reason you
must use the spoken word and broadcast your prayer, or message, by putting it into the air. Man
has within him the key to the process by which he may know all there is to learn and receive all
that he needs from the universal, divine supply. You tune in to this source and supply through the

                                                 72
spoken word by putting your message in the air and the divine, universal mind which is in tune
with yours will receive it. Other men and women throughout the world, who are in tune, will
receive your message and help you. You do not need any wires or any telephones to put your
message or spoken word on the air so that it will reach throughout the world. You know that no
wires are used with the radio, yet you know that all radios tuned to the same wave length will
receive the same message. This is one of the good reasons why you must not speak orally the
wrong words, or think the wrong thoughts, because they will be received by the minds in tune
with yours and will be returned to you. This is the law: that you reap just what you sow. You
receive according to what you give or send out. It pays you to always start your prayers or the
sounding of the Magic Word, Jehovah, with blessings and love to others. That is what you want
to return to you. The Bible tells us that it is not what goeth into a man's mouth that defiles him
but what goeth out of his mouth that defileth him. Therefore, you must be guarded in your
speech about others; do not criticize, condemn or find fault with others because the Bible says: as
you measure to your neighbour, he will measure back to you. The Good Book also says: Judge
not lest ye be judged. What right have you to sit in judgment of your neighbour or your
fellowman. His acts are between him and his God. Vengeance is mine saith the Lord, I will repay
all. When you know that you will receive according to what you send out you will then
understand why you cannot afford to hate, or think evil thoughts, because they will return to you.
For your own good and for your own reward you must dwell on love, and do kind deeds instead
of injury to others. Remember you cannot beat, evade, or cheat the Divine Law, and you will
reap just what you sow. Now is the time to start sowing right and using the Magic Word,
Jehovah, to bring about good things for yourself and others.

                                 The Word Jehovah
This is a word of three syllables and should be used for chanting in three syllables. The number
three is referred to more times in the Bible than any other number except the sacred number
seven. The word Jehovah contains seven letters and it is the great sacred Word. By chanting,
singing and vibrating the word Jehovah you will get better results than from using any other
word.

If you take seven pennies, or seven circles and place one circle in the center and six circles
around it you can then draw another perfect circle around the rim of the six circles, making the
sacred seven. With the word Jehovah you place O in the center and the balance of the letters
around it, making the sacred circle. This is the sacred, Magic Word of Power. In the past, people
have lost the way to use it. The Word has never been lost. It always existed and it always will. It
is symbolic of God and the Divine Power.

It is well known that deep breathing, as practiced by the Hindus, is beneficial to the health and
that they perform seeming miracles through the power of the spoken word and through deep
breathing. Therefore, the proper vibration of the Magic Word, Jehovah, will bring about
unbelieved results for you if you continue to use it at the right time, place and in the right way.

You should always repeat the word Jehovah three times a day for at least seven days, and you
will get better results if you repeat it three times seven, or twenty-one days.




                                                73
            The Time to Repeat the Magic Word, Jehovah
Based on the laws laid down in the Bible the best time to pray is morning, noon and night and
this is the best time to use the Magic Word, Jehovah. However, you may use it any time or place.
In cases of emergency you call on God at any time for help and he gives you the blessings if you
are living in obedience to the law. You should vibrate, chant or sing the Magic Word in three
separate syllables.

First, vibrate JE (hold it as long as you can) so the vibrations reach your stomach and bowels and
arouse the solar plexus and start it into action. The solar plexus is your superior brain. It gets you
in tune with all the unseen forces and the supreme Divine Power. The solar plexus works while
you sleep and heals your body and mind. Second, vibrate HO (sing or chant it) and hold the
sound vibration as long as you can until you feel it in your stomach and bowels. The word HO
and OH create powerful sounds and arouse the solar plexus. Therefore, this should be used and
repeated often. Third, vibrate VAH (sing or chant) as long as possible until you feel the vibration
in the pit of the stomach and into the bowels. After you have completed singing or chanting the
Magic Word, JEHOVAH, it is now time to ask for what you want or need. Send your message
into the air and then give thanks to God, the Divine Power, that you will receive what you have
asked for. This is proving your faith in the Divine Power and the Magic Word.

You should also repeat and vibrate the following: I AM GOD, LOVE, which contains ten letters
and ten is one of the Perfect numbers. The O in God, the O in Love and the O in Jehovah means
God, because the circle is all and contains all. It has no beginning and no ending, it is everlasting
and represents the Divine Being. O, or the circle, includes the world and everything in it because
it vibrates in a circle and takes in everything.

The Jews' name for God is YOD HE VAU HE, a word of four syllables containing ten letters or
one of the perfect numbers. This word can be used or vibrated the same as Jehovah. In ancient
times the people understood how to use things not only on three plains but into the fourth
dimension, which is one of the reasons the Jews used the name containing four syllables instead
of three.

The word GOD contains three letters and I AM contains three letters. The word AUM also
contains three letters and this is the word the Indians or Hindus use most to repeat, but the I AM
is the one that the Almighty puts the great emphasis on: "Then tell them that I AM hath sent
you." When you repeat I AM, sing or chant it, you attract or arouse the Divine Power and it
benefits you. When you repeat I AM JEHOVAH you are asserting your right as a child of God
and are entitled to all the benefits, provided you obey all the Divine Laws. You cannot expect to
receive all the good unless you act, work, give and express all of the good. Remember, you will
reap just exactly what you sow!
                                          Repeating
By repeating day after day the Magic Word, Jehovah, singing, chanting or vibrating it, you will
put your mind and body in tune with the Divine Power and will increase your hope and faith, and
what you pray for will come to pass. Do not think that you can pray for one day, or one time, and
expect to get results. You must obey the rule or law of the Bible: "Pray without ceasing." Repeat
often: "The Divine Power is working through my mind and body day and night to perfect my
mind, heal my body and bring an answer to my prayers." Work and have faith! When you have

                                                 74
finished a prayer always repeat the word JEHOVAH to close your prayer.

The best time to offer your evening prayer is just before going to sleep. At this time you are
resorting to Peace and quiet and it is more beneficial toward getting the best results. By thinking
of others and praying for them just before going to sleep, and sending out blessings to them, will
help to bring blessings and benefits to you.

                                     Mind and Body
Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by
a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God—what is good
and is pleasing to him and is perfect. -- Romans 12:2.

The mind has a great effect upon the body. Doctors have found that many people who think they
have a disease have nothing wrong with their bodies but have something wrong with their minds.
It is usually all imagination. Psychiatrists have found that by getting people to confess or go over
all their past history they can locate the trouble, which is really a short circuit in the mind. You
renew your mind and cleanse it when you forgive others and ask forgiveness yourself.

In this way you remove all the burdens and obstacles through the action of the mind, which
affects your body. When your mind is renewed and cleansed of all evil thoughts, or wrong
imaginations, the body begins to heal and is transformed because the mind has been perfected. It
is also possible that the body can be weakened by disease and this affects the mind. In most cases
the main trouble is in the mind and when the mind functions properly, through the use of the
Divine Power or Magic Word, Jehovah, the body is healed. When people are sick they get well
because they believe they will. No man ever dies until he gives his consent to do so. As long as
he has faith and holds on and believes in the power of the Divine Word he can prolong his life.
Good health is a normal condition. It comes about by obeying all the Divine Laws and natural
laws. There are three kinds of laws or three applications of the one law. You must apply the
spiritual law to spiritual things; the natural law or physical law to the body and to health; the law
of finance to financial things. Yet the law is the same whether it be the spiritual, physical or
financial - you reap just what you sow.

You might obey the spiritual law and at the same time disobey the law of health. In this way your
mind might be at ease, but your body would become diseased. In the same way you might be
obeying the spiritual and physical laws, having peace of mind and good health, but if you
disobeyed the law of finance you would have losses. Strict obedience to all laws is what brings
the reward.
                                    Music and Sound
The Bible is full of proof of the power of sounds and of the spoken word. The Children of Israel
were told to march around the walls of Jericho seven times in seven days and to sound the ram's
horn. They obeyed this law or command and when the ram's horn was blown on the seventh day
the walls fell down. This is the result of the natural law of sound, which can organize or build up
or it can disintegrate and tear down. A great violinist once said that if he could get the key to the
Brooklyn bridge he could tear it down through the sound of his violin. This is true. Glass can be
broken to pieces by sound vibrations, the human body can be disorganized through unpleasant
sounds. The body can be built up and healed through harmonious music or sounds. Columbia

University is teaching how to heal disease through music or sound. Anyone who has ever heard
the scream of a panther knows that the sound will send cold chills down the spine and cause the
hair to stand on end. The cause of this is that it disturbs the nerve center. The sound of the
screech owl is so disturbing that it is difficult to sleep within hearing distance.

Everyone's body contains a harmonious keynote and when he finds what music soothes him he
should listen, chant or sing it as often as possible. This will put the body in harmony and give
peace and contentment to the mind.

During the last war the Germans knew how to make sounds from the aeroplane to create fear in
her enemy soldiers and almost paralyze their nerves so that they could not fight.

It has been said that music will tame the most savage beast. We know that the Hindus, in India,
through chanting can tame the most dreaded of snakes, the Cobra, and when he is in perfect
harmony through the sound of music, he will not strike. Knowing the power of sound and the
harmony of music you can understand what the result must be on your body and mind when you
chant, sing or vibrate the Magic Word, Jehovah. It will produce harmony instead of inharmony.
Below are listed some quotations from the Bible on sound and singing:

You like to compose songs, as David did, and play them on harps. -- Amos 6:5.

                                             Fear
For the Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid; instead, his Spirit fills us with
power, love, and self-control. -- II Timothy 1:7.

This makes it plain that you bring about fear because you do not understand God or the Divine
Law. When you do understand these laws you are free and you do not fear. Fear causes more
trouble and misfortune than anything in this world. Job said: "I had a great fear and it came upon
me." This proves that the wrong thoughts will bring about the wrong results. You must supplant
fear with hope and faith. Learn how to use and apply the Magic Word, Jehovah, which removes
fear from your mind. Fear causes a short circuit in the mind and body, and until all fear is
removed you cannot make progress using the Magic Word, Jehovah.

I groan with sadness for Moab, with grief for Kir Heres. -- Isaiah 16:11.

Lord, look upon us from heaven, where you live in your holiness and glory. Where is your great
concern for us? Where is your power? Where are your love and compassion? Do not ignore us. --
Isaiah 63:15.

Many people do not understand what this means, "the sounding of the bowels." This is deep
breathing or vibration of the Magic Word, Jehovah, which arouses the solar plexus which in turn
affects the stomach and the bowels. If you can chant the three syllables of the Magic Word for
one minute for each syllable you will get better results in whatever you are praying for.




                                                76
                                             Time
I spend the night in deep thought; I meditate, and this is what I ask myself. -- Psalms 77:6.

Shout for joy to God our defender; sing praise to the God of Jacob! -- Psalms 81:1.

You hear my voice in the morning; at sunrise I offer my prayer and wait for your answer.
-- Psalms 5:3.

The Lord (Jehovah) is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. -- Psalms 118:14.

The above references tell you that it is good to sing or chant morning, noon or night, and to sing
or chant aloud. This also means to sing or chant the Magic Word aloud.

In Psalms 118, the word Lord means Jehovah and this again proves that you gain strength
through singing the Magic Word.


                                  Health and Healing
Apply the same rules of singing, chanting and vibrating the Magic Word, Jehovah, for healing
the body. Refer to the concordance and read everything in the Bible on fasting, breathing, eating,
exercising, thinking and drinking water and bathing in water.

The three requirements to sustain life are: eating, drinking and breathing. Did you ever stop to
think which is the most important and why? Men have fasted or gone without food for thirty to
forty days and still lived and got well. One can seldom live without water for more than four
days. Therefore, water is more essential than food. You cannot live four minutes without
breathing. Just try holding your breath for one minute and see what happens. This is proof that
proper breathing is the most important thing for your health and for your mind. By vibrating the
word Jehovah, the Magic Word, you send the breath or the air to the solar plexus and to the
bowels, thus putting the body in perfect harmony. This kind of breathing should be practiced
three times a day; morning, noon and night, if possible. However, you can get results by doing it
at any hour. My experience has been for the best results to practice this just before going to sleep
and when I first waken in the morning. Take seven deep breaths, exhaling and inhaling, rest a
few minutes between and take seven more deep breaths. Do this three different times, making
twenty-one in all. However, seven times at one time will bring good results. Each time you
exercise deep breathing vibrate the three syllables of the Magic Word, Jehovah, for three times
and speak the words: "I want perfect health." If you have any special diseases or pains ask that
they be removed. Speak the words: "I am sending the power of the Magic Word, Jehovah, to my
leg, stomach (wherever the pain may be)." Command the Divine Power through the Magic
Word, Jehovah, to go to the seat of your trouble and remove it. Have faith, believe that it will be
done, and it will be done.

                                           Eating
The problem of diet is different for different people. The Bible says that what is one man's food
is another man's poison. Each of you must learn by experience what is best for you to eat.
Moderation in eating is advisable. Most people eat too much. Read all references in the Bible
under eating.
                                           Water
This is next in importance to breathing. Most people do not drink enough water. You should
drink water at least three times a day, morning, noon and night. It will help you if you drink
water every hour, if possible. The body is over seventy percent water and you continue to lose
water through perspiration and elimination and what is lost must be replaced.

                                          Exercise
Stagnation is death and action is life. It is necessary to exercise in the open air as much as
possible. Waking is generally recognized as one of the best forms of exercise. Correct breathing
and exercising in bed is good. Each person can find the kind of exercise which will help him and
suit him best.

                                          Fasting
We have given many references on fasting as taught in the Bible. It should be practiced by
everyone. Both for the health and for mental condition. Fasting should be practiced at least four
times per year at the change of the seasons. The time of fasting should be from three to seven
days. Most people would be healthier and much better if they fasted one day in each week.
Abstaining from food will not hurt you, especially for a limited length of time but you must
always drink plenty of water and breathe properly. When you fast you give the stomach and
bowels a rest, and clean out all impurities. This removes the short circuit from the body and the
mind, being very beneficial. Many chronic so-called diseases can be healed through fasting.

                                 Prayer and Fasting
When the disciples asked Jesus why they could not perform the so-called miracles which Jesus
performed he answered them saying, "These things only come through prayer and fasting." This
is evidence that you may be praying for good health or for some disease to be healed, but that
you are not eating right or fasting and you will not get results because you are not obeying the
physical law.

In 1943 I had a severe attack of sciatic rheumatism. I had tried many doctors and remedies but I
continued to grow worse instead of better. I had been praying that my health would be restored
and had been using the Magic Word, Jehovah, but still I was not improving.

I started to read the Bible to find out what was wrong and what I should do.

One day I was reading St. Mark and came across these verses:

                                               78
After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive the spirit
out?"

"Only prayer can drive this kind out," answered Jesus; "nothing else can." -- Mark 9:28, 29.

After I read this I realized that I was probably making a mistake by not fasting and removing all
of the poisons from the body. I immediately went on a fast for nine days, eating no food of any
kind but drinking plenty of water and fruit juices. At the end of nine days I was completely well
and felt better than I had for many months. I was healed in mind and body. I then realized that I
need never have sciatic rheumatism again, if I obeyed the physical and spiritual laws. I have
never had a return of sciatic rheumatism. Soon after this time, in 1943, I started to write this
book, The Magic Word, but due to the war which caused a shortage of help I was unable to
finish it. After my retirement from active business I decided that I owed a duty to others to tell
them the value of the truth, which I had learned from the Bible, and to try to instruct them in the
use of the Divine Law which I had found worked for me when I practiced it. I know of hundreds
of other people who have followed this law and used the Magic Word and received great benefit
from it. You, too, will receive benefits if you apply the rules strictly and obey all of the
commands as laid down in that great Book, the Holy Bible.

                          Things to Do to Bring Results
Give yourself to the Lord; trust in him, and he will help you.

Don't give in to worry or anger; it only leads to trouble. -- Psalms 37:5,8.

"Stop fighting," he says, "and know that I am God, supreme among the nations, supreme over the
world." -- Psalms 46:10.

Morning, noon, and night my complaints and groans go up to him, and he will hear my voice.
-- Psalms 55:17.

But as for me, I will pray to you, Lord; answer me, God, at a time you choose. Answer me
because of your great love, because you keep your promise to save. -- Psalms 69:13.

Then men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the
earth. -- Psalms 83:18.

Remember your promise to me, your servant; it has given me hope.

Even in my suffering I was comforted because your promise gave me life.

In the middle of the night I wake up to praise you for your righteous judgments.

Seven times each day I thank you for your righteous judgments.

Those who love your law have perfect security, and there is nothing that can make them fall.

I obey your teachings; I love them with all my heart. -- Psalms 119:49,50,62,164,165, 167.
                                               79
Remember when you learn how to use the Magic Word, Jehovah, and obey all the laws and
commandments of the Bible which will give you health, happiness and prosperity, the one thing
which you will have to guard against most is wrong speaking and wrong thinking. If you can
overcome the greatest hindrance that brings about all others, which is fear, you will have
accomplished all the results promised in the Bible through obedience to the Divine Law and
through the use of the Magic Word, Jehovah.

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art
with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. -- Psalms 23:1-4.

Meanwhile these three remain: faith, hope, and love; and the greatest of these is love.
-- I Corinthians 13:13.

       "If I can throw a single ray of light
       Across the darkened pathway of another;
       If I can aid some soul to clearer sight
       Of life and duty, and thus bless my brother;
       If I can wipe from any human cheek a tear,
       I shall not then have lived in vain while here."

Jesus drew near and said to them, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.

Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them my disciples: baptize them in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

And teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And I will be with you always, to
the end of the age. Amen. -- Matthew 28:18-20.

This book, in order to benefit you, must not be read once and laid aside. Read it at least three
times over a period of three weeks. If you will read it one time, each month in the year, and
follow the instructions on how to use the word, JEHOVAH, i.e., chanting, humming or saying
the word.

                     HEART TROUBLE
                  MAN'S GREATEST ENEMY
Medical reports show that heart trouble is taking a greater toll of useful men and women each
year than almost any other disease. Part of the money received from the sale of this book, THE
MAGIC WORD, will be donated to teaching how to cure heart trouble through the use of the
Magic Word, JEHOVAH, and by proper breathing. All diseases can be cured by the divine
power. The Bible makes this very plain. God's power is the greatest, and Jehovah's way is the
right and best way. Try it and prove it to yourself.

W. D. Gann is in his 72nd year, he is in good health, active and young, and he can do as much
work as he could when he was 30-years old. He gives credit to the divine power and by his using
the Magic Word, Jehovah, for his good health and success.
