Sacred Geometry

Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends is a mathematical approach for
comparing the relationships between market highs and lows in both time and
price amplitude.

Teachers in the centers of education throughout the ancient world, such as those
founded by PYTHAGORAS & PLATO set their pupils to practice the arts of
DYNAMIC GEOMETRY and NUMEROLOGY in order to exercise the faculty of
intuition.

The ancients taught that any situation in life may be represented by a DYNAMIC
PATTERN for which there exists a precedent in nature. GEOMETRY deals with
pure form, philosophical geometry re-enacts the unfolding of each form out of the
preceding one.

The ancients devised a canon of proportion. The canon demonstrates the
squaring of the circle and the binding relationships between the SQUARE, CIRCLE
& the GOLDEN MEAN. The circumference of the CIRCLE is equal to the
PERIMETER of the SQUARE.

Using Geometry we can prove the ratio 1.618 maintains a triangular relationship
with the square, the cube and the circle. This association is extremely important
for our purposes because all Geometric forms must rotate from one axis to
another if they are to continue too relate in the future.

HARMONIC RATIOS are generated from the diagonal relationships found
within the SQUARE. Musical notes vibrate on ratios of the square. HARMONIC
RATIOS relate to the number 2 and square root of 2.

SQUARE ROOT OF 2= 1.4142 SACRED CUT = 0.707

The Sacred Cut 0.7071 is equally as important as 0.618 when dealing with
proportion. Later on we will see how the two ratios integrate the unfolding
geometry within a markets structure.

Arithmetic ratios will play a part in the construction between the major cardinal
ratios.

recommend the book SACRED GEOMETRY by Robert Lawlor, published by
THAMES & HUDSON.

Introduction to Time & Price

Time and price analysis requires the use of charts to plot the price history of a
market or index. Charts have two dimensions, the horizontal for TIME and the
vertical for PRICE.

A chart is like a road map to a technical analyst. It provides us with a pictorial
view of the markets past activity. By analysing the past we can learn the
characteristics and habits of a market.

TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS is about identifying the market price levels
where support or resistance is likely to eventuate.

Price support & resistance levels can be determined mathematically using
the past price activity.

Each individual market will develop its own CYCLES. These cycles will
relate to future time duration between market highs and lows.

The future is just a repetition of the past in another geometric form.

Price highs and lows, prior bull market and bear trends, will relate geometrically
to each other in TIME & PRICE. Often they will relate in very simple ratios,
other times they can be quite complicated to recognise, unless you can understand
the intricacies of the geometric forms.

It is the purpose of this manual, to provide you with a complete knowledge of the
tools available, to recognise when a market has reached a support price or a
resistance price.

With this knowledge you will know when it is opportune to buy or sell.

The tools and methodologies I will teach you are DYNAMIC in nature, that
is why this manual is named:-

DYNAMIC TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS OF MARKET TRENDS

Introduction 2-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

DYNAMIC - means comparing actual price and time and evaluating the
proportional relationship.

The secret to becoming a professional technical analyst is to keep it simple. The

more you complicate the issues, the harder it is to recognise the order between
the unfolding patterns.

To get started, here is an actual example of PRICE which occurred in the
Australian Share Market Index known as the ALL ORDINARIES INDEX.

There are three unmistakable instances of PRICE PROPORTION in this example
for the expert and novice analyst to take note of:-

Price relationships of:-
2.000 1.4142 1.732

1. The price rise in each bull market related by a factor of 2.000.

In 1991 the bull market rose 498 points, between 1992 and 1994 the next bull
market rose 994 points 2 points short of exactly twice.

2. The 1991 bull market rose from its low of 1199.6 by a factor of 1.4142
1199.6 multiplied by the Square Root of 2 (1.4142) gave a target price of 1696.5
3. The 1992-94 bull market rose from its low of 1355.8 by a factor of 1.732
1355.8 multiplied by the Square Root of 3 (1.732) gave a target price 2348.3
PRICE PROPORTION at the 1994 high was also evidenced in a much larger
degree when compared to the 1982-87 range from the 1991 low.
The unfolding pattern of the 1991-1994 bull markets topped out as a proportion
of the 1982-87 bull market on 0.618.

The 1982-87 bull market rise was 1870 points (13 x 144), the total rise

in points from the 1991 low to the 1994 high was 1150 points (8 x 144),

ie., 8- 13 = 0.618

* Gann taught students to count off price increments in squares of 144
degrees of price and 144 degrees of time.

Introduction 2-3
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

The first question I ask myself when I witness GEOMETRY of price ranges such
as this is, "How could this activity be random"?

To be absolutely sure you are not looking at a random event you must confirm
TIME has related in a degree which can be identified using the same principles.

When dealing with major market changes of trend there should be evidence of
DYNAMIC RATIOS OF TIME between trend changes of similar degree.

TIME PROPORTION RELATIONSHIPS are often easier to monitor than price
relationships. This is because time can only move on one axis whereas price
relationships can be formed in either price units or percentage change
relationships.

I have found after years of experience that TIME is the underlying reason why
markets reverse trend. As Gann taught, "When time is up the trend must change."

RN. ELLIOTT states in his theory, "All waves of similar degree will relate in
TIME amplitude."

Introduction 2-4
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

At first glance the TIME CYCLES illustrated in Fig 2.03 would appear quite
complex to the novice analyst.

I like to keep things as simple as possible, so I look for relationships on major
ratios such as 1.000, 1.618, 2.000, etc.,

The evidence of CYCLES within markets can usually be seen easily with a little
determination.

To illustrate this principle with the All Ordinaries Index high in 1994 1 would look
at the relationship between major lows and highs.

1987 was a major high - the date of the high was 21st September 1987.

1987 was a major low - the date of the low was 11th November 1987.

1991 was a major low - the date of the low was 17th January 1991.

The 1994 high date was 3rd February 1994.

The time from the 1987 low to the 1991 low was 1148 degrees - the time from
the 1987 high to the 1994 high was 2296 degrees. Exactly 2.000 times.

The time in days was 1163 to 2327, 1 day over 2.000.

Introduction 2-5
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

There is no purpose to be served by continuing these examples at this stage, it iS
more important for me to lay a foundation for you, so you would appreciate how
important the observations were at the time they occurred.

What I hope I have pointed out so far are two things :-

1. Price ranges in trends are important to monitor.
2. Time relationships between changes of trend are important.

Each can be defined using the Canon of Proportion.

W.D. Gann
To complete this introduction to TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS it would be wise to
mention W.D. Gann once more.

W _D. Gann believed that PRICE & TIME could be inter-related, ie., TIME could
be compared to PRICE and PRICE could be compared to TIME.

Gann called this technique SQUARING TIME to PRICE and PRICE to TIME.
For most markets it is not practicable yet there is a good example of this principle
at the 1994 high in the All Ordinaries Index.

Conducting Time And Price Analysis

Can be time consuming to say the least, for years I struggled with ways to
uncover the information I needed to know.

Finally I created an analysis package of my own design which allowed me to test

and prove the principles I hold so true.

My requirement for TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS needs only the important dates
and price levels where changes in trend of a tradeable nature have occurred.

For this I have created a simple SWING CHART system. Swing charts can be
created in MINOR, INTERMEDIATE or MAJOR degree market swings.

SWING CHARTS also help eliminate the day to day noise from my analysis and
keep my mind in perspective to the main trend.

Most of the following examples of TIME and PRICE analysis will be
demonstrated by my personal software CYCLETRADER. The routines I have
developed automate the discovery process a trader needs to keep his mind on the
job. It's no good to discover 3 weeks after a major change in trend things which
could have influenced your opinion of the market.

Every trader needs technical information up to the minute if he is to control his
emotions and move with the ebb and flow of the buyers and sellers.

Price Measuring Techniques

Measuring the proportional relationships between market trends (market highs to
lows / and or / lows to highs) is the best way to begin with PRICE ANALYSIS
using geometric pattern identification.

Relationships will form in several different ways :-

1. Direct relationships.

2. Diagonal relationships.

3. Alternate relationships.

In each case we are comparing advances and declines as ratios to each other. The

ratios in the square, cube or triangle. Occasionally relationships can be identified
as relating to the circle.

Dynamic Price Relationships

The following diagrams are a guide to the way RATIO RELATIONSHIPS form
within market trends.

Each future market move is working out a price relationship to the past.
Sometimes the relationship will relate in price units, other times the relationship
will relate in percentage change. When neither of these associations are apparent
there will be a relationship between VIBRATION. We will discuss this form of
price/time analysis lateron.

FIG 3.82
Percentage Change Retracements Alternate Wave Ratios
Outside Wave Ratios inside Wave Ratios Divisions of Total Range

R.N ELLIOTT states in his theory, "All waves of similar degree will relate
in PRICE amplitude."

1. PRICE UNITS
2. PERCENTAGE CHANGE

In any completed trend it should be clear that PRICE has related by at least 2
different methods of comparison.

Direct Price Relationships

These are commonly known as price RETRACEMENTS. This is the first place to
start with, mainly because this is the first introduction any chart reader gets to
price analysis.

Ever since I can remember any technical analyst, I ever met, knew about price
retracements. Mostly their knowledge was limited to simple relationships such as
38.2%, 50% & 61.8%.

For instance if a market rose in a bull trend 100 points, then reversed trend and
found support 50 points below the high it would have made a 50% retracement.

Unfortunately for most traders and analysts, who have a limited knowledge of
price retracements, the signalling for a reversal of trend depends on numerous
other factors. These are :- the unfolding geometry of price & time. Analysts who
trade 50% retracements without any other knowledge will lose money in the
market 8 out of 10 times.

If you have been taught, to expect a reversal of trend at a retracement of 50% of
the prior move, you will already be aware that trades taken at these levels have a
20% probability of success. Sometimes they work for a few days but then the
market moves on and breaks the 50% support.

Diagonal Price Relationships

These types of price relationships are 3rd dimensional in the context of the market
movement. .

It would be great if the only ratios were 0.382, 0.500 and 0.618, 1.000, 1.618,
2.000 but this is not the case in the real world!

Nevertheless the above ratios do signal changes in trend 33.3% of the time.

The market is a continuous spiral of activity. Price relationships between
significant highs and lows oscillate from one series of ratios to another.

The best way to confirm PRICE is with two or more confirmations. As well as
with the combination of TIME CYCLE analysis.

When the Sydney Futures Exchange contract for the Share Price Index - Futures
contract for hedging the All Ordinaries Index - made high on 7th August 1995 at
2199 the PRICE relationships were working internally as well as externally.

A signal like this confirms the 0.707 retracement level of the 1994 Bear market as
important.

When time is up it will be confirmed by PRICE.

July 17th, 1996 the Sydney Share Price Index made low at 2086 on very strong
TIME.

The points decline from the previous highest high in the bull market from 1994
was 50% (288) of the total points decline in the 1994 bear market (575).

Incidentally both values are on the Gann square of 144.
144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008, 1152, 1296, 1440

This is impressive behaviour for a market which is considered "random" by most
people I encounter outside of the technical world.

Sometimes the numbers in price ranges hold a special significance to certain
markets. As far as this market is concerned the "square" of 144 appears and

reappears time after time.

Other often repeated numbers are 72, 90, 180, 216, 224, 256, 512.

Percentage Change To Price

Percentage change to price between market tops and bottoms can often be a
useful technical indication there is an order within the unfolding patterns.

GANN states in his teachings that price support and resistance occurs naturally at
levels associated with the important ratios we are using for the dynamic time and
price calculations.

For instance a 100% increase in value in a long-term trend would be a strong
resistance level. Conversely a 50% decline of value would create a strong level
for support. See W.D. Gann 10-9 where the ASX-All Ordinaries Index found
support in 1987 after a decline in value of 50%.

Common expansions in value of 25%, 33.3%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 66.7%
can be found in most markets. Currency markets tend to work to percentage gain
or loss in major trends.

100% gain 1991 to 1994 - SPI
The gains made in the SFE-Sydney Share Price Index between the 1991 low of
1184 and the 1994 high 2368 was an exact increase in value of 100%.

Dynamic Percentage Change Relationships

Percentage change can be used to examine dynamic price relationships in trends
of similar degree, in the same manner as price units.

Often when a relationship in price units cannot be found, the answer lies within
the percentage change relationships.

Percentage change is a third dimension factor of price.

Whichever way the price of a commodity, stock, index or currency is quoted will
often effect the way the geometry unfolds.

For instance, an old example from my second book Geometry of Markets II
comes to mind when the IMM Deutsche Mark Ist Month Continuous contract
made perfect geometric percentage gains and falls in three major degree waves.
See Fig 3.10.

The low of 58.55 (920320) was also a 61.8% retracement of price in 38.2% of

time. I remember it well because I predicted it well in advance, you can verify
that one with Larry Pesavento.

Time Measuring Techniques

Measuring the proportional relationships between market trends (market highs to
lows, and/or lows to highs, or lows to lows, or highs to highs) is no different to
the approach I use for ratio analysis of price.

Time is a simpler calculation to monitor than price and is the more important tool.

Relationships of TIME elapsed in trends will form in one of 3 ways:-
1. Alternating cycles.

2. Direct cycles.

3. Internal cycles.

If you make a study of any free trading market you will be able to identify time
proportion between trends of similar degree. I am going to present some examples
I have seen over the years to show you how simple they are to identify.

The exact date and price, at each important change in trend, are recorded in the
swing file so every calculation relating to time is precise.

Direct Time Cycles

Time cycles can be measured in calendar days or solar degrees. I use both but
prefer solar degrees because solar degrees reflect the natural cycles of the
universe.

Solar degrees are the divisions of 360 degrees in the circle of 1 year. The
elliptical path of the Earth revolving around the Sun causes the relationship
between degrees and days to speed up and slow down.

Internal Time Cycles

The reason many analysts using standard time cycle techniques fail to recognise
the simplicity of the geometry of time relationships between market highs and
lows is because of a third dimension at work.

To simplify the explanation you have to imagine the market cycles are working
along a geometric spiral or a harmonic square. If you study the Cannon of
Proportion you will see how each sequence can relate to each other.

If the student takes direct, alternate and internal cycle relationships into account it
is possible to predict the next critical point in time where the market trend will
reverse trend.

On 3rd February 1994 the Australian Share market made a major change in trend.
If you study the next three charts you will see the exactness of the time cycles
squaring out.

Also see Fig 2.04, section 2-5, this top is displayed on a weekly bar chart.

Geometry of Time

I would like to point out something simple every analyst should know about
identifying the strength of time cycle squarings; Future critical ratios should have
some history of reliability based on past performance.

Every market should leave a footprint for us to work with.

If you look at the internal time cycle relationship (2.00) in Fig 4.04 culminating at
the 1994 high, on its own this could have just been a random event. The fact that
it wasn't is demonstrated by the ratio relationship with the prior major low, ie., the
1992 low. From the 1987 high to the 1992 low the time cycle relationship with
the low/low cycle 1987-1991 was 1.618, see Fig 4.07. Prior to this relationship a
couple of other important highs and lows were in geometric proportion.

When you discover a cycle at work you should always take note of the next
critical ratio in our sequences of proportion, this will help you prepare possible
future change in trend dates. As the dates approach the market will demonstrate
by its own activity if the dates are important to us or not.

For instance the next "RATIO" in this sequence would be 2.618 times the
1987-1991 time range forward from the 1987 high. The date was the 24th
January, 1996. Only a minor degree low occurred on this date.

You could actually learn from this scenario of low to low projected forward from
the 1987 high and project ratios of:-

1987 low - 1992 low 1806 degrees forward from the 1987 high
1.618 2922 degrees 2nd November 1995 Intermediate Low
2.000 3612 degrees 2nd October 1997 ?

If you look at Fig 4.06 and project the next "square" of time, 4 times 366, from
the 1991 low. The date is 9th February, 1995. The exact date where the market
bottomed, see Fig 4.01.

This same "square", 6 times 366, from the 1991 low falls on the 19th February,
1997. This date coincides with 1 times the time from the 1991 low to the 1994
high projected forward.

The "square" of 2 times 366, from the 950209 low also falls into sync.

At this time the market has reversed trend exactly to the day of the 19th February,
1997 in an Intermediate degree.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

The time measuring tools I have demonstrated in this chapter, are the most
powerful tools I am aware of for detecting change in trend. There are other
ancillary tools which I have mentioned in my previous two books.

I am going to digress for a moment as I need to impress on you the importance of
the information I have just imparted.

I have spent 15 years and thousands of hours studying, programming and testing a
wide variety of markets. I have satisfied myself these tools will work in any free
trading market. Over the years I have publicly made many market calls either on
the day or the day after an important market high or low. I have been right more
times than wrong. My belief system in this methodology is tuned in because I've
done the hard work. Yours can be the same if you also do the work.

One of the most outrageous market calls I made in public, was at a meeting of
technical analysts on the night of the 1987 low in the Australian Share Market, it
was Wednesday the 11th November 1987 and the market had closed on its low
for the day. That day the market index had reached a level just over 50% (50.3)
off its (then) all time high on the 21st September 1987 and completed a 61.8%
(62.2) retracement of all the gains from 1982, a decline of 1163 points in 51 days,
from a high of 2312. The fall from grace in this market was swift and devastating
and caught 90% of the traders I knew at the time. I had bought some blue chip
stock that day and my broker Alan Balding from Prudential Bache was present at
the meeting to confirm it. Everyone in the room, about 30 people, were in a state
of shock when I said, "The market has bottomed today, if it hasn't you can come
around to my place next week and you will find my papers, computers and
everything I have worked on in the last 5 years in the street, because I will be
changing my occupation!"

I must admit I was totally serious at the time, lucky for me I was right because I
have really enjoyed teaching people about these methodologies since.

More recently, in front of 45 ATAA members, on the 18th April 1995 I predicted
the top of the Japanese Yen / US$ for the next day. The top was made on the 19th
as forecast. Then in Malaysia I was a speaker at the Ist WORLD TECHNICAL
ANALYSIS CONFERENCE over the weekend of July 1-2, 1995. At the lunch
time panel, in front of 250 people, I warned everyone not to buy the Yen for it
was in a major bear market. It never traded higher than the Friday's price and
since then has declined over 25% in value.

A month or so prior to the share market crash in 1987 one of the major brokers,
McCaughan Dyson in Melbourne, had been negotiating with me to come and
work with them as part of a strategic investment research group. I declined to go

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

after several weeks of negotiating and board room lunches. The problem for me
was, I kept telling them we were very close to a severe market downturn.

I recommended they should warn their clients to start hedging, I even put it in
writing. When I realized they didn't want to know, I decided I couldn't work with
anyone who didn't respect my work, they only wanted me as a figure head.

I got a lot of satisfaction out of telling them "I told you so" when the market took
the huge dive.

Another thing of interest I must mention relates to the time leading up to the share
market crash in October 1987. A prominent futures broker in Melbourne ran a
futures trading contest which began in early September 1987.

The contest was for real time trading on your own account and obviously
designed to increase their brokerage commission and client base. It cost $1000 to
enter and all entry fees were to be distributed as prizes.

Everyone with a local reputation in the industry was solicited to enter. In fact
they even did a special deal with me so I would play the game. They agreed to,
and did, refund to me a percentage of my brokerage fees after the event, because
I wouldn't pay the competition rate, except for the purposes of the competition.

To my best estimate there were about 55 private and corporate entries.

The results were based on percentage gains to the starting value of your account
equity. Leaders results were published each Friday in the Financial Review, our
daily financial newspaper.

At no time were there anymore than 5 traders names with positive % gains on the
list published each Friday.

I asked the broker why they were only publishing positive results, and he said,
"We don't want to embarrass anyone”.

You can imagine why, it would have been bad for business!

After the share market crash the competition was cut short, the end result was 4
or 5 people in profit. I was number 4 or 5 with a 50% gain in equity on my
account over 8-9 weeks trading. It computed to an annualized return in excess of
400%.

I used time and price analysis to select all my trades throughout the competition,
my tools stood the test and didn't let me down.

Time Analysis 4-8
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

The reason I mention these things is because it reminds me to stay doing what I
know is might. I know I can rely on my tools to forecast or trade without hope or
fear, everything I do is based on probability and knowledge.

More recently I have refined my tools to only the ones I am showing you in this
manual. If all you do in the future is follow the market and keep a track of the
unfolding patterns and cycles you will always be prepared for possible change in
trend.

The technical analysis world has attracted a lot of charlatans to its ranks. Many
claim to have the "Holy Grail" to sell you. I can tell you from experience, there is
no "Holy Grail" but if there was, the techniques I am teaching you would be the
closest you could get to it.

TIME CYCLES form in every market, the cycles are peculiar to that market or
market complex, they are not some standard time value such as 13 weeks, 26
weeks, 38 weeks or 52 weeks. They are dynamic and will continue to repeat
themselves time and time again.

Carefully study each market complex you are going to trade and see if you can
uncover the predominate cycles of time that are carefully camouflaged within.

Once you find the key the future will seem so easy you won't believe it.

Dynamic Vibration Analysis
[C] 1986 Bryce Gilmore

Dynamic Vibration or Space Analysis if you prefer is a derivative of both TIME
& PRICE.

The dynamic vibration of a range is calculated thus:

Number of price units from low - high / by number of days or degrees

For instance if a trend began at a level of 2086 and terminated at a level of 2520 it
would have advanced 434 units of price.

If the time from the low to the high took 217 days then we could calculate the
Vibration as:

Price = 434 Time = 217
Dynamic Vibration = 434 divided by 217 =2 units per day

Dynamic Vibration Analysis

INVOLVES COMPARING INDIVIDUAL MARKET CHANGE IN TREND LEVELS FOR
GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS IN SPACE.

IF ONE CANNOT IDENTIFY A GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIP DIRECTLY BETWEEN PRICE
UNITS OR TIME UNITS THEN A COMBINATION OF BOTH SHOULD BE EVIDENT.

Relationships can form in similar ways to the way we would compare Price or
Time relationships.

Market corrections
Sometimes in a market correction the price level where a reversal and resumption
to the prior trend begins does not fall on a retracement ratio of the sacred canon.

This example will explain the concept of Dynamic Vibration in a market
correction.

The ASX All Ordinaries low of April 3, 1997 broke just below the 0.382 price
retracement level of the prior bull market of similar degree. Yet, price support fell
exactly on the 0.500 dynamic vibration angle of the previous range vibration,
indicating a geometric relationship between time and price.

Dynamic Vibration 5-2
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Dynamic Vibration Ratios between Alternate Trends of
Similar Degree

This methodology is similar in technique to comparing either Time or Price.

A geometry of Time and Price between waves of similar degree can often be
confirmed in this way. This technique is extremely useful when you have some
doubt as to the level of degree of trend change to expect.

Once again I will remind you, "The Elliott Wave Theory states, 'All waves of
similar degree will relate in both time and price amplitude.’ R.N. Elliott.”

In this example of the July 3, 1997 high in the Sydney Share Price Index, the
expansion rate of the 1994-1996 range is multiplied by 1.618. The 1.618 vibration
angle intersects the July 3 high when drawn off the July 17, 1996 low. Also the
0.707 vibration angle intersects the April 3, 1997 correction low.

It is because of this knowledge I named my previous two books GEOMETRY
OF MARKETS.

When it comes to identifying market tops and bottoms VIBRATION clears up the
picture if the Time and Price signals seem a little vague.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Dynamic Vibration Sequences In Corrections

During the unfolding bull market from 1994 to 1996 I observed the following
ratio sequence between the advances and the corrections. The Ist correction
terminated on the 0.382 angle of the advance, the 2nd on the 0.486 angle of the
advance and the 3rd on the 0.618 angle of the advance.

Corrections will often terminate on angles drawn at strict geometric ratios of the
prior advance. When time is up (on a pressure zone) always review the dynamic
vibration relationships for a confirmation of time and price squaring.

Corrections will often terminate on price retracement levels as well as direct
vibration angles 50% of the time. Other times they will oscillate between price
and vibration.

Use all your tools all of the time and you will be rewarded. When in doubt follow
the trend!

Always remember, the truth is in the experience! The geometric relationships of
time and price between unfolding waves in any market have stood the test of
time, and will continue to do so in the future. Be a believer and profit from this
knowledge.

FIG 5.@8 DYNAMIC UIBRATION OF A PRIOR RANGE — 8.382 ANGLE ACTING AS SUPPORT

If you review Fig 5.07 the 3 correction lows were also related dynamically to the
prior major range (1994 bear market) vibration angle of 1x 0.382.

In Gann terms the bear market from 940203 high 2368 to the 941123 low 1793
squared price in time, 575 points in 287 degrees, 2 points per degree. Vibration
rates as accurate as this occur from time to time, ie., 1 to 1, 2 to 1, 3 to 1, et
cetera, but I wouldn't count on it happening to often, I only accept it when

everything else lines up.

Chart Scaling is important for a visual perspective

To measure and calculate DYNAMIC VIBRATION requires the component of
TIME to be scaled in either CALENDAR DAYS or SOLAR DEGREES.

Trading day calculations have no validity in time calculations as a chart of trading
days alone is corrupted due to weekends and holidays.

When it comes to time - time is time - time does not have any gaps - time is

important whether the market is open or not. Price will adjust for time
when the market is open.

Chart Patterns I Monitor

My first serious introduction to charts was through my broker back in early
1981. I began by subscribing to a weekly chart service. In the beginning my
technical expertise was limited to drawing trend lines on my charts to locate
support and resistance levels. As time went by I was introduced to the idea of
regular chart patterns forming in the many markets I was trading. It didn't take
me long to realise the predictive value of PATTERNS formed on my charts.

Understanding the implications of chart patterns will always reward the
technical trader. It gives you an edge when you need to make a decision
based on time and price analysis.

PATTERN ANALYSIS is so important for determining the strength of any
market trend.

I monitor CASH MARKET prices against the FUTURES CONTRACT.

FIG 6.@1 MONITOR CASH & FUTURES FOR BULLISH OR BEARISH DIVERGENCE

Pattern Analysis 6-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

One of the best confirmations of strength of trend, at a top or bottom in the
market, is to compare the CASH market price action against the FUTURES
for DIVERGENCE in price.

I am often surprised when I meet seasoned analysts and they are not doing this.
Fig 6.01 is a comparison between the ASX - All Ordinaries and the Sydney
Share Price Index during a major correction in 1990 within a continuing bear
campaign. The reverse situation is more likely in a bull campaign, ie., in a bull
campaign the Futures would make a new high and the Cash would fail to
confirm. You will have noticed throughout the prior sections I have many double
tops and bottoms on my swing charts. All of these evidenced a divergence
between the Futures and the Cash markets.

Market Strength

Another practice one can use to monitor the underlying strength of a market, is
to compare the top stocks against the broad market.

For instance the Dow Jones Industrials Index and the Dow Jones Transport Index
were used by Charles H. Dow to formulate his Dow Theory.

If both were making new highs the overall market was bullish, if one was failing
to make new highs when the other was he considered it a non-confirmation of
trend.

Recently the DJIA and the S&P500 signalled a bearish divergence prior to the
mini melt down in October 1997 as Fig 6.02 shows.

The first sign of trouble was when the moving averages and the Directional
Movement Index signalled a SELL 7 days prior to the melt down. The pattern
was an added extra for the astute analyst, including me.

Daily Price Activity (Range)
Daily trading activity, ie., how the actual current trading day related to the prior
day or several days is a very important indicator of the market strength.

The OPENING PRICE is very important in relationship to the CLOSING PRICE
each day, especially when the market trades in a wide range.

Technical analysts have special names for daily range patterns, the primary
ones are:-

Reversal day

The relationship of todays closing price to yesterdays closing price, today's
opening, high and low price can often alert traders to a shift in demand by
buyers and sellers.

REVERSAL DAY PATTERNS are an important indicator when they occur on a
price and time zone at extremes of a medium term trend. They are also important
for the identification of the expiration of a corrective move.

The identification of a REVERSAL DAY can alert you early when there is a
change in the MINOR trend.

Reversal Days

Reversal days are any day where the market makes a new high or low in the
primary trend and then closes with a negative advance to the prior days close.
The larger the daily trading range the more important.

Japanese Candlesticks

Japanese candlestick charts can be helpful when looking at patterns. The DOJI
means “A sudden danger". A doji is formed when the opening and closing price
are the same. According to Steve Nison the doji are valued for their ability to call
market tops.

The reason for the negative implications is because the doji represents indecision
among the buyers. It takes the conviction of buyers to sustain a rally. A doji after
a sustained uptrend represents a vacillation by buyers.

The gravestone doji is a particularly important daily pattern for a reversal in an
uptrend.

The three black crows is a good confirmation that the bears are taking control
over the buyers. A black crow is formed when the market closes lower than the
opening price. Three consecutive down days with closes lower than the opening
price indicate a break down in trend.

I like the way Japanese candlesticks make the pattern more visible. BLACK
days are DOWN days, WHITE days are UP days.

There are more than 50 Japanese candlestick patterns explained in Steve Nison's
book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, the explanations are clear and
concise, I recommend it.

Trend Lines - Old Highs and Lows

Predominantly I watch the position of the market relative to TREND LINES,
Old Highs and Lows, I watch to make sure a bullish trend is continually making
higher lows or a bear market is making lower highs. Once the first violation
occurs J am on alert for a change in degree of trend.

It has often been said, "Old support = new resistance, Old resistance = new
support". With this in mind, each time the price activity crosses below an old
low or above an old high there is power in the current move.

Accumulation and Distribution Patterns
Prior to any strong move up or down, more often than not, markets will trade
within a range for periods of 2 to 6 weeks, sometimes longer.

The patterns formed in an accumulation or distribution phase have names such
as:-

Triangles

Flags

Pennants

Rectangles

I would recommend the book "Technical Analysis of Stock Trends", by Robert
D. Edwards and John Magee for an expanded explanation of patterns and their
implications. Every trader should own a copy of this book.

Pattern Analysis 6-7
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Why is Pattern Analysis so Important?

The future will always be a repetition of the past in some form or another.

Pattern analysis is the basic reason why technical analysts keep charts. If one
wishes to become a master of technical analysis it is important to know the
implications contained within the unfolding patterns.

If you wish to exploit trading opportunities with a 65% plus chance of success,
then you should study chart patterns which reliably offer trading opportunity.

The patterns I refer to are patterns which identify conditions where a
predominant trend will resume. In every market move there will be a minimum of
three sections, ie., The first move indicates the new trend. When the trend is
indicated there will be a correction before the next section begins.

If you find reliable ways to identify a resumption to the main trend you will be
taking trades which have the best likelihood for success. I don't think it is
unreasonable to try and pick the extreme high or low of any trend when I have
TIME & PRICE, nevertheless once a trend is identified you have to learn how to
milk it for all it's worth.

I think the only way for every trader to take advantage of any market, is to study
past price patterns and find the ones that suit his/her trading personality. When
the new market patterns fall into your required parameters check for time, price
and trend indications for signals which confirm this view. If everything agrees,
take the trade. If your research, trading plan and money management is valid you
will make a success of trading.

If on the other hand you forget about pattern and trend and rely purely on TIME
& PRICE you will be taking unwarranted chances.

Please remember the four things that are important to any trade selection.

TIME - PRICE - PATTERN - TREND

Trend Confirmation

Today there are many sophisticated indicators available to the technical analyst
for the confirmation of trend strength or weakness.

The old saying, "The trend is your friend." is the best advice I can give anyone
who wants to make an occupation trading futures markets.

Most markets are only moving in a consistent trend about 30% of the time, when
they are they offer exceptional opportunity for trading profits. At times when you
are getting clear cut indications of a strong trend in progress extra positions can
be taken.

Markets move through phases going from stable to overbought or oversold and
back again. There are so many system traders in the market using trend indicators
and other methods to initiate trades, once all the indicators fall into place you can
reliably expect a surge in that direction. Trend indicators are useless in a
correction except to warn you of a possible change.

Trend Analysis 7-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Fig 7.01 gives an example of how you can combine trend indicators and pattern
recognition to initiate trades.

Starting from the top of May 2, 1996 which squared time in major proportion and
made a double top with March 4, 1996 (see Fig 4.01 and Fig 6.04) a
confirmation of trend was signaled with the OUTSIDE REVERSAL DAY on
May 9 and a crossover of the 4/18 day moving averages. A sell on the OPEN the
next day with a tight stop-loss was indicated. The market opened at 2292 made a
high for the day at 2294 and closed on its low at 2259. In a little over two months
the market had declined to a low of 2086 to meet strong time cycles and price
support (see Figs 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 4.03) without breaching the entry price.

The rally into late June made a double top with the prior correction high (May 31)
and a resumption to the downtrend was signaled when price broke below the
June 13 prior low on July 11 and closed lower on the day.

The strength of the resistance of the May 31 rally high was evident by the price
retracement level of the high and the Gravestone doji pattern. Indicators were still
short and sell signal was indicated for the next open.

Trend Analysis 7-2
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

There were several places a short term trader would be forced to cover to protect
profits. But if you used a few simple rules and only traded with the trend you
should be able to take profits.

One important observation I made during this bear market was the high of July 2
was not confirmed by the CASH market. The futures contract had just rolled over
and came on with a premium to the prior month.

By the way daily patterns in the Cash are useless due to the opening price nearly
always being the prior days closing price.

Whenever you get a rollover in the futures contract new opportunity is created.
This is because a major drop in open interest takes place, due to the expiry of
positions held by professional hedging. Within a day or so new hedging by the
professionals begins, this often leads to the establishment of a new trend.

Changes in open interest in any futures market can act as a guide to the position
of the professionals. Never forget to track the open interest activity. Open
interest can only rise when there are new sellers entering the market.

When in doubt the only place to turn is with the standard trend indicators. Trend
indicators are normally a confirmation of what is really happening mid-term.

If you have an idea that is not being confirmed by the trend indicators, then it is
time to give it up. Don't expect the market to save you, you must save yourself.

WHEN INDICATORS BECOME OVERBOUGHT OR UERSOLD PRICE & TIME IS THE
ONLY WAY TO IDENTIFY THE END OF A TREND
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

For indications of trend I follow several simple indicators.

These are:-

Directional Movement Index - DMI
Relative Strength Index - RSI

Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD
Slow Stochastic - %K %D
Moving Average on Close - 4/18 crossovers and 5/34 crossovers.

50 day Moving Average

CycleTrader Trend Waves - Fast, Medium & Slow.

To my mind most of the indicators I have studied do similar things, some faster
than others, therefore why over complicate the issue. They will read overbought
or oversold at 3rd waves highs and lows, they will diverge with price at 5th wave

tops and bottoms.

One thing I know from experience is that the best profits are gained by trading
with the trend. If you want to be a counter trend trader you must have a short term

trading perspective.

Much of the time when I identify time and price signals I will not place a trade

until I've got a confirmation from pattern and trend.

Trade Entry Techniques

The first requirement of a trader is to find an entry point where risk can be
controlled.

I am going to demonstrate two important methods of entering a trade:-

1. Buy or sell at the opening price.
2. Buy or sell at the closing price.

Chart patterns demand you to consider each of these techniques, if you wish to
control risk.

Under certain conditions it pays to be aggressive and take a small risk, in others it
is better to take a conservative approach even though the risk is going to be

extended.

In nearly all cases it is important to trade only with the indicated trend.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Buy Or Sell At The Opening Price

At the beginning of a bull move, especially after a strong move down, trend
indicators will take some time to tum long. You will observe them turning from
short to long, and can anticipate from the moving average crossovers and the
DMI, if the market were to make a new high price they will signal a buy.

1 know from experience that the moment trend indicators roll-over a flood of
orders will hit the market. Usually the market will surge out of its current trading
range as sellers cover and new buying takes place.

Tell-tale signs are one or two higher lows after the major low in an accumulation
pattern.

The day of the breakout the market will usually OPEN on its LOW for the day
and CLOSE on its HIGH.

Days like this reduce risk to a minimum, for you can enter on the open and
place a 5 point stop-loss on your position. If the market does not go your way
it is not as strong as you think; you're sidelined quickly with a minimum of
cost!

Just prior to the market opening you can get the opening call and assess if your
suspicions of a breakout are going to be confirmed. I normally edit in the
theoretical opening call and see how it will effect my trend indicators.

This is probably the safest entry technique a technical trader can employ.
If you get stopped out of your position and the market still breaks out - don't
worry and chase it. Wait for the next day and buy on the open with a tight
stop-loss. The reason is clear, if a new trend is strong the market will surge, if it's

not the chances are it's a false breakout.

Sometimes you may miss a move if the market is not strong but it's better than
holding a position with an unmanageable equity loss.

Long Term Trend Line Breakouts

These opportunities are rare so be on the lookout for them, you need to be able to
plot at least 2 years of daily price bars.

This breakout occurred the day after a contract roll-over as the professionals
started to build up new positions to replace the ones that had just expired.

The breakout day was confirmed by trend indicators signaling a change in trend
to long.

Selling Double Tops & Buying Double Bottoms

These are not especially common, but if you find a situation where the market is
about to make a high or low in close proximity to : an old top or bottom and your
time signals are all synchronized.

NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS MAJOR TIME CYCLES PRESENT.
You will have all day to decide!

You can take a chance at picking the high or low day in the market IF YOU ARE
PREPARED TO TAKE ON MORE RISK. The problem is there can be a
variance in the price (either under or over) the old top or bottom.

The best way to handle days like this is to watch the market activity throughout
the day, if the price range displays weakness on the day, ie., closes weak in
relationship to the extreme point of the day. BUY or SELL at the close.

If the market breaks your way next day you are set, if not you are out quickly
with an unknown loss.

If time is right you should end up with a good trade! The more intermediate
degree distance between the double tops or bottoms the better.

Buying Or Selling Range Breakouts
This was one of the first trade entry techniques I started with. I found after
several years of trading (successfully) this method contained many limitations.

Under certain conditions this entry method has to be employed, otherwise you
stand the possibility of missing a good trading opportunity. Especially in a fast
running market.

A range is any type of congestion pattern where a market contains itself within a
price retracement level and a prior high or low depending on the trend. Some
times a range can be defined over a week or so other times the range may extend
to a month or more.

As the price trades to the top or bottom of the range you have the possibility
of a double top or double bottom, intra-day breakouts with a close back
inside the range are not a confirmation of a breakout; the close must be
outside the range.

The only effective way I have found is to buy or sell on the close, only if the
closing price is outside the range. You place a stop-loss for the next few days just
inside the breakout price level.

Buying Breakouts From An Intermediate Degree Triangle
Triangles can form during an accumulation pattern after a severe decline in
market prices.

The implication of power in the triangle is implied by the higher lows giving it an
ascending appearance.

Once the breakout has closed above the RESISTANCE levels of the highs in the
triangle, an excellent buying opportunity is signaled.

To take advantage of the next days trading session it pays to buy on the close.

Once everyone has realized the chart pattern the market should be called much
higher on the next days opening.

W.D. Gann talked about support & resistance levels being broken on the 3rd or
4th attempt. If a market couldn't break through on the 4th attempt it was fatal.

If one of these opportunities comes your way trade it!

Head & Shoulders Tops

Sometimes a topping pattern called a Head and Shoulders will form at a major
reversal in trend.

The day of the HEAD will witness super strong TIME CYCLE relationships with
the past.

The right shoulder will be confirmed by a break of the neckline. Sell on the first
close below the neckline.

This example back in 1986 was especially eventful due to the double top at the
head. Always be on the alert for a head and shoulders confirmation of a major
high. One word of warning, head and shoulders patterns can form in intermediate
degree. After the market has corrected sufficiently the prior bull market trend can
continue. A break, first above the downtrend line taken from the head and the
right shoulder and second a break above the head will confirm a continuation.

After this decline the market rose vertically to the 1987 high. A prominent
Melbourne Elliott Wave Analyst CEO publically held short positions against the
prevailing trend and bankrupted the company.

Below are some examples in the Share Price Index which occurred throughout

One Elliott Wave analyst was so convinced the head and shoulders was the end

one that sent Ian Sykes broke. His company held its short positions against the

I wouldn't expect a novice to appreciate the beauty of price ratios falling together
the way they do. It takes experience and study before you can recognize
situations like the one below. .

I saw this one back in 1990 and took advantage of my knowledge. I have seen
many similar situations over the years that would be hard to explain here.

It is up to the student to study the past for knowledge. To explain every possible
way a market can "square" time and price would be wrong of me. If you have a
CycleTrader it will be easy for you to do what I do.

If you follow any market on a day to day basis you will see what I see, ie., if you
follow the procedures I use. If you expect easy trading profits without doing the

work, then, give it away now. You have no chance!

Start with the simple set-ups and as you learn more add the more sophisticated
trading signals to your trading plan.

Classic Time & Price Signals

These usually occur in retracements of prior ranges. They repeat over and over in
MINUTE, MINOR and INTERMEDIATE degree waves. More often than not
when they are going to work the market pattern will provide the information you
need to jump in with a close stop loss.

A Classic Minute or Minor degree signal is the trend indicators about to, or
just rolling long or short 1 or 2 days prior to the TIME & PRICE conjunction.

Money Management Techniques

To be successful gambling for profit or speculation if you prefer, requires a strict
money management plan.

I know why because prior to my introduction into commodity futures I had
studied and played most casino games, including being a competent backgammon
player. I have been a runner up in the Australian Open and the Victorian Open
backgammon championships. Backgammon is a game that relies on the fall of
two dice. The probabilities of the result of any dice throw have strict
mathematical probabilities. If you understand these probabilities you can play for
percentage results, if your opponent fails to do the same, over time you will win.

The futures market is possibly the worlds most even playing field for the
speculator. Mainly because you can enter and exit at will. I liken my approach to
trading as playing poker without having to put up an ante. Each day I have a
chance to see my hand, if I think I have the equivalent of 4 Aces I will make a
bet; if not I stay out.

In the long run, by applying money management rules to the probabilities, I can
eliminate much of the nsk associated with trading.

Mark Douglas, author of "The Disciplined Trader", once said to me in front of
Larry Pesavento, "You must decide on a plan of trade selection, never deviate
from that plan and then execute your plan flawlessly." In addition he said, "Once
you're in the market and start breaking any of your rules, you are out of control."
From my own experience and having been involved with traders and investors the
world over I knew I had never heard truer words!

Everything Mark Douglas ever said to me was only another way of expressing my
own inner thoughts and feelings. Mark just seems to have a better way to explain
it.

My basic money management rules are:- Divide your investment capital
into 18 speculative stakes, control your down-side risk on any one trade to 1
investment stake. Look for a return of 3 to 1 or better on any win. Trade or
bet on a plan that has proved to win at least 40% of the time.

Think Golf

A trading plan that makes 18 trades with a win/loss ratio of 40-60 at 3 to 1 odds
results in 7 wins and 11 losses, 7 by 3 = 21 wins and 11 losses, this results in a
capital gain of 50% over 18 trades.

If the ratio of wins to losses can be increased the percentage return increases
dramatically, also if you can do better than the 3 to 1 ratio the results increase
dramatically.

The way I look at it, it's like a game of golf for a 15 handicapper. If you go out
and play 18 holes you will make a bad score on 2 or 3 holes, then you will bogey
4, par 9 and birdie 1 or 2, once in a while you will make eagle.

It's the pars and the birdies that make the difference between a good score and a
bad one. When I play golf I don't give in if I start off badly because I know I have
16 or 15 holes to go. If you can maintain a focus on the overall game you can
score over the 18 holes. Sometimes you can start off well and then fall into a
slump for a few holes, it's a matter of discipline to play out the 18 and arrive back
at the club house a winner.

The secret to good golf is that each time you tee up you make your best effort to
place yourself in a good position to finish the hole. It's the same with trading,
don't hit off unless you give yourself the best chance of success. If you hit off
badly pick up the ball and walk to the next tee.

If you want to trade well, think you are playing a game of golf and the game's not
over until the 18th. After each 18 you can re-think your plan and move onto the

next course.

If you keep your mind right you will eventually become a scratch marker.

Aggressive traders with a reliable trading plan can work on a 9 trade scale up
system.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

TRADE SELECTION PROCESS

To make any system work a trade selection process has to remain uniform. It is
therefore important to set up a plan for each type of trade selection signal you
want to follow.

I would recommend separate allocations of capital be employed for different
types of trades.

1. Buying trend line break-outs on trend confirmation.

2. Selling trend line break-outs on trend confirmation.

3. Buying or selling range break-outs on trend confirmation.

4, Selling double tops.

5. Buying bottoms or selling tops on advanced time and price signals.
ESCALATING RISK

For each plan you should make 18 trades before increasing your original stake.

After 18 trades your results will be easily quantified, you may then wish to
modify your plan. Don't increase your stakes just because you are winning, this is
a deviation from your original rules.

CHECKLIST BEFORE MAKING A TRADE

l, Is this a valid trading opportunity basis my trade selection rules?
2. Where have I set my stop-loss limit?

3. Can I accept the risk?

If all the answers are YES then take the trade otherwise reconsider.

Without a consistent trade selection process combined with a solid money
management plan all will be lost.

W.D. Gann Analysis Techniques

Time by Degrees

W.D. Gann can be credited for the introduction of time by degrees to the world
of technical analysis.

Gann often mentioned the square of 360 and the divisions and multiples of 360 in
his work. He was referring to the degrees in the circle.

A year is the dominant natural cycle that influences our lives and our activities. In
a solar year we have 365 1/4 days but the circle of 1 year is 360 degrees.

Time by degrees is not a simple ratio of days in the year, eg., you cannot
calculate 1 degree as 365 divided by 360. Time by degrees must be
calculated from the position of the Earth relative to the Sun in its orbit of
360 degrees. 1 day is only the time it takes for the Earth to spin on its axis.

W.D. Gann 10-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

The Earth moves through an elliptical orbit around the Sun, not a perfect circle.
As a result the relationship between days and degrees speeds up as the Earth is
moving closer to the Sun and slows down as the Earth is moving away from the
Sun. The two points in the elliptical orbit where the Earth is closest and
furthermost from the Sun are known as the PERIGEE and the APOGEE.

The seasons of the year are determined by the TILT or AXIS of the Earth. As the
Earth circles around the Sun the direct path of the Suns rays move in relationship
to the surface of the Earth. The hours of sunlight vary in length from day to day. If
you live in the southern hemisphere the shortest day is the June Solstice and the
longest day is the December Solstice. On the Equinox days the daylight hours are
equal to the hours of darkness.

Due to the elliptical orbit of the Earth the relationship between days and degrees
varies.

0-90 89 days 90-180 89 days
180-270 93 days 270-360 94 days

If you are comparing a time cycle that occurred between 0-180 degrees and one
that occurred between 180-360 degrees the calendar day counts will vary
dramatically with the degree counts.

Counting time by degrees keeps seasonal time periods uniform. To calculate
TIME BY DEGREES requires the use of a planetary ephemeris.

Critical Seasonal Dates

Gann taught that the cardinal points of the year were important to watch for
change in trend.

The Equinox and Solstice as well as the Perigee and Apogee days are natural
cyclic events. If you study past markets you will find an abundance of trend
changes falling on or close to these dates.

Anniversary Dates

Gann also taught that it was important to watch the anniversary dates of past
trend change dates in any market for a reversal in trend signal.

W.D. Gann 10-2
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Counting Time between Change in Trend dates
TIME COUNTS using special numbers can often pinpoint future dates where
change in trend will occur.

Time counts in days, degrees, weeks, months and years are made from extreme
intermediate degree market highs and lows.

Gann taught that by counting TIME BY DEGREES, in squares of 90 and 144
as well as divisions of a year from prior market highs and lows of importance,
would produce clusters of future dates where a change in trend could occur.

Gann's square of 52 was a weekly square used on weekly charts, ie., divisions of
a year.

Time By Degree Counts

This methodology has become a trade mark for Gann's supposed success in
predicting a future change in trend date for any free trading market.

Although the calculations have a validity in nature they must also be qualified as
to their true value.

I have found that many change in trend tops or bottoms in markets conform to
some of Gann's time counts, I have also found that many did not!

To count off TIME BY DEGREES Gann style all one has to do is calculate the
future date ? degrees from a known high or low date. If you extrapolate the
process from numerous past highs and lows you will construct a table of dates
which will highlight clusters of future dates. These future dates are a warning date
where change in trend may occur.

The standard divisions of a year of 360 degrees which could be important using
this Gann technique are, my version of important counts are highlighted:-

Gann Swing Charts

The Gann swing chart is a simple indicator to keep you aware of the short term
trend. Gann recommended 2 types of swing charts. —

I/. 2 day swing chart. 2/. 3 day swing chart.
The swing chart swings up and down depending on the current days trading range
when compared with the prior 2 or 3 days trading range.

The rules for the 2 or 3 day chart are as follows:-
1. The trend is up when the market makes higher highs without crossing
below the prior 2 or 3 day low.

2. The trend is down when the market makes lower lows without crossing
above the prior 2 or 3 day high.

3. When prices are very active, ie., wide range days in a blow off move you
can record a swing on a 1 day reaction for the 2 day chart.

4. When prices are very active you can record a swing on the 3 day chart

if it makes 3 consecutive days with new lows or highs.
5. Both charts are based on highs and lows not closing price.

Over-balancing of price and time. —

In an advancing market watch the price ranges of the counter trend moves. Once
the next reaction has exceeded the price range of the previous, price is said to be
over-balanced and the trend is changing. The opposite works in a falling market.
As each trend matures reactions should be reducing in both time and price.

Squaring Price Into Time & Time Into Price

One of Gann's techniques of analysis for determining market tops and bottoms
was to "square" price into time and time into price.

There are 3 distinct approaches:-

1. Squaring a high or low price forwarded in time.
In the example below the All Ords 1987 low was 1149. The first "square"
of 1149 counted in "degrees" fell within 1 day of the 1991 low.

2. Squaring a price range forward in time.
There are 2 examples below, the points decline between the 1987 high and
the 1987 low was 1163 points. The calendar day count between the 1987
low and the 1991 low was 1163 days exactly.
The price range between the 1987 high and the 1991 low was 1113 points,
the calendar days from the 1991 low to the 1994 high was 1113 days
exactly.

3. Squaring time between highs and lows forward in price units.
My first example is below, the time between the 1987 low and the 1991
low came out at 1148 degrees. The points rise to the 1994 high was 1150

points.

W.D. Gann 10-6
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

When squaring time into price units you can take the time between any two
market change in trend dates. The price units are calculated from the ending date
of the time cycle you are going to "square".

Just recently I saw this example "square" up at the 19th February 1997 high.
The time between the 1992 low and the 1994 low was 726.5 degrees.

The price units between the 1994 low, 1793 and the 19th February high,
2520 was 727 points.

If I can find perfect examples of Gann's approach to squaring time & price and
time to price 40+ years after Gann passed away, then these techniques of analysis
are worth monitoring, even if one might feel they may be self fulfilling.

My comment:

The time period from the 1991 low to the recent 19th February 1997 high was
2225 days. The price range squaring between the 1987 high to the 1991 (1113
points) low went 1 square at the 1994 high and 2 squares on the 20th February
1997.

I was expecting a high on the 20th February 1997 within 1 day and let everyone
know at our 8th February 1997 seminar in Southport. There can be some minor
inaccuracies using these techniques due to the time of the day the lows or highs
are made.

Gann Angles & Gann Zero Angles

Gann angles and Gann zero angles are another technique for squaring price to

time.

1, Angles are drawn from prior highs or lows at ratios of 0.25, 0.5, 1,2 &4
points per day. At times in the future a market reversal will occur on the
value of the angle. The Gann interpretation is that at this moment price is
square with time.

Example: The 1x1 angle (1 point per degree) from the 1982 low
intersected the 1987 high on the all ordinaries index. The time from the
1982 low to the 1987 high was 1872 degrees and the price range was
1869 points. A FIBONACCI ratio of 13 times 144.

2. Zero angles are angles drawn up from 0 (zero) beneath an important
high or low. When a market reversal occurs on the value of the angle it
means that the current reversal value has squared time with the high or
low from which it began.

Example: The 1x1 angle (1 point per degree) drawn up from under the
1987 high reached the 1199.6, 1991 low after 1199 degrees from the
1987 high had elapsed.

Gann Price Retracement Levels Of A Prior Range

This technique of analysis allows you to relate price range to price range
geometrically. .

The units risen in a bull market are related to the units fallen in a bear market or
vice versa. This technique is useful in any time frame, relationships can be
worked out between moves which occur very short term or long term.

Gann taught students that ratio retracements of prior ranges were very important
for determining change of trend and worked with 1/8ths of the prior range. The
50% level is the most important level of a prior range according to Gann.
Unfortunately the world is not a perfect place and natural geometry often requires
other relationships for the continuing price structure to remain geometric.

Elliott wave recommends ratios of 0.382, 0.50, 0.618 as the most important. We
have found that there is another element of geometry involved and ratios of 0.577
and 0.707 that are harmonically related to the Square and the cube can be equally
important under certain circumstances.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Projecting Extension Levels Of A Prior Range

In case anyone is in doubt about the importance of the 2520 INTERMEDIATE
DEGREE price level in the Sydney Share Price Index this example will help
clear up the picture.

Projections of this nature can be made in 1/8ths, 1/3rds and ratios 0.382, 0.618,
do not leave out 0.577 and 0.707.

If one had gone through the exercise of projecting future price targets, prior to the
19th February 1997 high, the 2518-20 level stood out as being very important
within the unfolding price geometry. Also 2520 is equal to 7 times 360.

Price levels of extreme importance can be identified when two or more major
wave retracements or projections fall within a point or two of each other. We call
these levels clusters. When a market trades into a strong price support or
resistance level we can evaluate from the daily pattern and the time relationships
with the past how important the level may turn out to be.

Technical analysis is a discipline of probabilities. Many of the probabilities can
be calculated in advance, this does not mean they will be fulfilled, yet when they
are working they will be confirmed by the market itself.

Unfolding Price Ranges In Trends Of Similar Degree

Unfolding price ranges can relate to each other in two ways:-

1.

Each impulse range can relate by a ratio of the preceding
range of similar degree.

In the example below of the Sydney Share Price Index expanding upwards from
the 2086 low, 17th July 1996 to the 2520 high, 19th February 1997, there were
three distinct low to high ranges of equal proportion. After the first two
expansions of 224 points were recognised, myself and several analysts I know
calculated that 2518 would equal a triple wave range of similar degree when
measured from the take off point 13th December 1996 at 2294. The fact that 2518
fitted in with all the other price projections confirmed it as a very important level.

When the 2520 high was made time and price squared at 2 points per day from
the 17th July 1996 low, another important Gann observation!

When looking for additional confirmation of price squarings you can monitor
both the cash market and the futures contract, it will help you immensely.

2. The last impulse range can relate by a ratio to the overall
move in the current series of waves.

Example:
The impulse waves in the All Ordinaries Index, up to the February high, were not
the same price ranges as the SPI, yet they were working to their own geometry.

The impulse wave 5 from the December low, wave 4, topped out as 50% of the
total range from July 1996.

I have seen many instances where the 4th wave low or high relates to the overall
range by a geometry of 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.667 and 0.707.

If you want to project these price levels in advance take the price units between
the beginning of the trend, ie., 0 to 4 and add the reciprocal value of the ratios. for
0.500 add 1.000, for 0.618 add 1.618, for 0.707 add 2.414.

INCIDENTLY the wave 2 in the example below subdivided the total range at the
0.707 level. This means that 4-5 was 0.707 of 2 to the high.

Divisions Of A Range Identify Unfolding Geometry

In a bear trend of 3 waves A-B-C the C wave could even be 0.707 of the total
decline.
There was an instance of this in the SPI decline between May and July 1996.

To project a C wave of 0.707 of the total range multiply the price units between
high (B) and B by 2.414 and deduct the result from the price of B.

If B-C is going to be 0.707 of the total range then (B)-B will be 0.293 (1.000 -
0.707). 2.414 times 0.293 = 1.000.

SFE - Sydney Share Price Index - 1991 Low

It is important to understand the intricate ways markets can relate in time and
price. W.D. Gann and R.N. Elliott opened my eyes and I will never forget it.

By combining both of their disciplines, together with pattern and trend and long
term cycle analysis it is possible to explain every market reversal of trend that is
important.

At the time of the 1991 low in the All Ordinaries Index I noted the following time
and price relationships within the Share Price Index which is the futures
derivative. I have often mentioned these relationships to students but, this is the
first time I have put them into print. If you study everything contained in this text
you will be prepared when similar situations repeat in the future.

Use my examples to get an idea of what to look for when a market changes
trend, if you explore the past it will open your eyes to the power possible from
this knowledge.

W.D. Gann 10-15
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Since the 1987 crash the Sydney Share Price Index has traded through 3 major
bear markets.

It's important for the future to note that the 1992 decline and the 1994 decline
were ratios mm time of the 1989-1991 bear market. Any future bear market should
relate in time, by ratio, to one of these prior bear markets.

I know that in the future we will experience another bear market similar to one of
these, especially in regards to a large price decline. Once the next bear market
takes hold I will be looking at future dates that fall on ratios of time to one of
these bear markets.

At most major market reversals you will find perfect cycles of time generated
from prior highs and lows. Often but not always the TIME or PRICE counts fall
on important numbers mentioned on pages 10.3 and 10.4.

Gann repeatedly states in his writings and books, "The future is just a repetition
of the past, there is nothing new under the Sun."

The future is working out time and price to that which went before.

If you are prepared to study the past, then, the future will explain itself as it
unfolds.

R.N. Elliott Wave Analysis

R.N. Elliott introduced his thesis of wave analysis to market watchers back in the
1930's.

Ralph N. Elliott was a retired engineer, who because of health reasons began an
exhaustive study into market analysis. Elliott developed his theory, based on
natural law, of the way the US share market expanded and contracted, ie., the
time and price relationships between bull and bear markets during their
development and adjustment stages. He later worked on Wall Street operating a
market advisory service.

Elliott's basic tenet was, "All waves of similar degree will relate in both
TIME & PRICE amplitude."

Whilst I have already explained the many facets of TIME & PRICE relationships
and the way they can occur within a markets structure, it would be careless of me
not to review Elliott's teachings in this manual, as I subconsiously use them on a
day to day basis myself.

ELLIOTT WAVE STRUCTURES

To keep track of the stages a bull or bear market moves through, Ralph Elliott
developed a lettering system to keep track of waves of similar degree.

Waves are broken down into stages from:-

CYCLE I, 0, OF, IV, V

PRIMARY [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [A] [B] [C]
INTERMEDIATE OQOAAdANAS (ABO
MINOR 1234 5 ABC
MINUTE iii iti iv v a bee

Each completed lesser degree wave sequence completes a single wave of higher
degree, ie., 1-2-3-4-5 of MINOR degree could complete either wave (1), (3) or
(5) of INTERMEDIATE degree. | Wave A-B-C of MINOR degree would
complete either wave (2) or (4) of INTERMEDIATE degree.

Elliott Wave 11-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Elliott's Basic Counting Theory

BULL MARKETS
Elliott's rules state that each expansion will unfold in a 5 wave sequence or 7 or 9
waves with extensions.

Waves 1, 3, 5, 7 & 9 will be impulse moves MADE UP OF 5 WAVES in the
direction of the primary trend.

Waves 2, 4, 6 & 8 will be corrections to the main trend MADE UP OF 3
WAVES as an A-B-C.

BEAR MARKETS
In a bear market the A - wave will most likely contain 5 legs, the B - wave 3 legs
and the C - wave 5 legs.

IMPULSE WAVES
Impulse waves determine the trend and contain a minimum of 5 legs.

CORRECTIVE WAVES
Corrective waves normally contain 3 legs.

(aj

FIG 11.61 EXAMPLE OF ELLIOTT WAVE COUNTING TO LABEL MARKET STRUCTURES

Elliott Wave 11-2
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends
There are several important rules one should note about Elliott Wave.
These are:-

1. The overall trend is established by the direction (up or down) of the
waves containing 5 leg sequences.

2. Corrective wave patterns in a 5 wave sequence will ALTERNATE.
Wave 2 and 4 will alternate in appearance, for instance a simple wave
will be followed by a complex looking wave or vice versa.

3. Wave 3 is usually the strongest impulse in appearance and will be
accompanied by strong indications of overbought or oversold.

4, Wave 4 corrections will normally terminate within the area of the
previous wave 4 of lesser degree. Often a wave 4 will terminate on a
38.2% price retracement of the previous impulse wave or 38.2% of the
total advance in the series.

5. Triangles in 4th waves indicate strength in the wave 5.

6. Extensions can only occur in impulse waves and are very common,
extensions are far more likely in 3rd or 5th waves.

7. A break of the channel line extended from the termination of waves [2]
and [4] signals a major change in trend.

Anyone wishing to make a comprehensive study of Elliott Wave can do so by
studying the following two books.

MASTERING ELLIOTT WAVE by Glenn Neely, 1990, is probably the most complete work
I have seen on Elliott Wave analysis. Neely deals with the real world and offers
an exceptional insight into the patterns formed by market price activity. (223
pages) Neely in my opinion is the expert of Elliott Wave!

ELLIOTT WAVE THEORY by Frost and Prechter, 1978, is the first book on Elliott Wave I
started with. This book contains all the basic information but, it is difficult for a
novice; it needs to be read 4 or 5 times before the concepts begin to become
clear. (190 pages)

Elliott Wave. 11-3
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

The Overall Trend Is Established By The Direction Of The
5 Wave Sequences

The main benefit of this knowledge lies in the fact that trends propagate (grow on
themselves). Once the minor waves start growing in 5 waves you can expect the
intermediate and primary waves to do the same.

BHP 1987-98

FIG 11.82 TREND IS ESTABLISHED BY THE 5 WAVE SEQUENCES

Generally when a trend is well established the corrections become shallower and
shorter in duration. In a strong trend counter trend reactions generally last no
longer than 3 days.

Degrees of wave movement can be evaluated by comparing their price ranges and
time duration.

For instance when a subsequent correction OVERBALANCES the price and/or
time of a prior correction, the move in progress, is usually of a higher degree and
the wave count can be re-evaluated.

Continuation of the trend is signalled by the price breaking out to new highs or
lows when the reactions are less than those that went before.

Wave 3 in any 5 wave sequence will usually be the strongest and it normally
ends with the trend indicators in an extremely overbought or oversold condition.

Corrections ie., waves 2 and 4 should normally alternate in appearance.
Corrective waves take on either "simple" or complex" forms. A "simple" form
will normally be followed by a "complex" form or vice-versa.

Elliott Wave 11-4
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Overbought & Oversold Markets (Wave 3)

I have noted that on nearly all occasions, wave 3 ina BULL market impulse ends
with the market in an overbought condition.

Wave C in a correction often ends with the market in an oversold condition.
The best indicator for OVERBOUGHT or OVERSOLD is the RSI and DMI.

RSI - Relative Strength Index 10 day
Overbought when above 80
Oversold when below 20.

DMI - Directional Movement Index 10 day
Overbought when the + DI rises above 40 and the DMI rises above the +DI.
Extremely overbought when the -DI remains below 10 for 3 days or more.

Reverse applies to for Oversold signals.

The RSI and the DMI are analysis tools designed by J.Welles Wilder Jr. More of
his work can be found in his book NEW CONCEPTS IN TECHNICAL TRADING
SYSTEMS, 1978.

Monitoring trend indicators on a daily basis keeps one alert to the possibility of a
change in trend.

I have noticed over the years the more people learn about Elliott Wave the more
diverse their opinion of wave counts become.

KEEP IT SIMPLE!
The basic concept is that BULL markets will unfold in a series of 5 waves or
sections. 3 will be up and 2 will be corrections. The end of each wave will be

labelled 1-2-3-4-5. Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves. Waves 1, 3, 5 are
impulse waves.

IMPULSE WAVES can be subdivided into 5 waves of lesser degree.

Extensions can form in IMPULSE waves, ie., instead of 5 waves they could
extend to 7 or 9 waves. Extensions can form in waves 1, 3 or 5 but never in all.

Over long periods I look for a place to identify a wave 3 and then work
backwards for my wave count.

Elliott Wave 11-6
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Wave 4 Corrections

Wave 4 corrections will normally terminate within the area of the previous
wave 4 of lesser degree. Often a wave 4 will terminate on a 38.2% price
retracement of the previous impulse wave or 38.2% of the total advance in
the series.

This is an important observation and can help you set price objectives after
identifying a wave 3 termination.

In my first book GEOMETRY OF MARKETS I used BHP (Broken Hill
Proprietary Limited) for an extensive example of analysis techniques. It seemed
very clear to me back in early 1988 that the high made in 1987, prior to the crash,
displayed the character of a 3rd wave of cycle degree. In retrospect the
retracement in the 1987 crash was just short of a 50% retracement of all gains
made from the 1974 low. Since 1988 this market rose in value more than 2 times
its value at the 1987 pre-crash high.

The 921117 low in BHP can clearly be identified as a PRIMARY wave 4 as it
retraced 38.2% of all gains made from the 1982 low. This infact gives rise to the
question of the 1987 high being a PRIMARY wave 1 instead of a CYCLE wave
III. This being the case the $20.05 high is potentially a CYCLE wave III.

Rule of Alternation

Elliott Wave states that corrective patterns (waves) in a five wave sequence
will ALTERNATE. ie., waves 2 and 4 will take on a completely different
appearance.

Elliott gave names to the patterns formed in corrective moves:-

Zig Zag

Complex Flat

Double Three
Running Correction
Symmetrical Triangle
Ascending Triangle
Descending Triangle
Expanding Triangle

Triangles are far more common in 4th waves so one should expect the wave 2 to
take the form of a simple zig zag, complex flat, double three or running
correction.

Wave 2

1. Wave 2 normally retraces at least 50% of all the gains made in the wave 1.
2. If Wave 2 is a Zig Zag it can often retrace 61.8%, 70.7% , 78.6%.

3. | Wave 2 normally expires on a direct time relationship measured from the

duration of Wave 1.

Complex Flat .

A complex flat correction implies power in the 3rd wave. A sideways movement
in market price over an extended period implies accumulation. When the market

eventually breaks to a new high it is doing so because there are more buyers than
sellers.

A symmetrical triangle occurs in a market where the buyers and sellers are fairly
balanced. Volumes continue to decline as the triangle is formed. Each of the legs

ranges of the legs will relate by a factor of 0.618.

The expanding triangle more often than not forms over long periods of time. The
market continues to trade i ever expanding ranges making higher highs in the
rallies and lower lows in the declines.

Expanding triangles are very hard to predict and only become obvious well after
the outcome is known. Nevertheless as the triangle unfolds there will be definite
time and price relationships formed between the legs either directly or via
alternate wave relationships.

Bullish Consensus

Perhaps the most important consideration of Elliott Wave is how it takes the
bullish consensus into account as a trend indicator. ©

Each type of wave formation holds a character all of its own.

Nevertheless I have noted in recent years, the patterns are becoming more
complex due to the speed of communication, and the sophistication of analysis
techniques aided by the computer power now available.

With todays computer power, volumes of trade are possible that were never
experienced in Elliotts day. That is why I think the explosive moves generated by
an overbalance of buyers and sellers are accomodated quickly and result in
significant reversals of trend intra-day.

My Summary of Elliott Wave Strong Points

1.

2.

Wave 4's normally terminate in the area of the 4th wave of lesser degree.
Wave 4's generally retrace 38.2% of prior expansions.

Wave 3's are usually the longest and strongest waves, but never the
shortest.

Wave 3's nearly always terminate with overbought or oversold trend
indicator readings.

Alternation between corrective waves will be a guide to the position of
the market.

Time and Price within future trends will be working out ratio relationships
to trends that preceded them.

One of Elliott's main points was that bear markets endured or retraced
0.618 of the time or price of the preceding bull trend. This was an
important observation considering the tools Elliott had to work with at the
time.

Forecasting Future Dates for Change in
Trend

To begin with, I will repeat what I said in the TIME MEASURING
TECHNIQUES chapter. The future proportional TIME CYCLE relationships
between market trends (market highs to lows / and or / lows to highs / or lows to
lows / or highs to highs) will relate as they have in the past, for the future is just a
repetition of the past.

W.D. Gann has been quoted as saying, “There is nothing new under the Sun.”

Relationships of time elapsed in bull and bear swings will form in one of 3
ways:-

1. Alternating time cycles.
2. Direct time cycles.
3. Internal time cycles.

If you are starting from scratch you will have to make a study of the market you
are going to forecast and prepare a swing file of MAJOR, INTERMEDIATE and
recent Minor degree swings. I call this an optimised SWING FILE.

The Random Approach

The random approach is to project multiples and divisions of all major cycles into
the future, beginning from the end of the projected cycle. We then look for
clusters of dates where conjunctions of cycles meet.

The CycleTrader has a time projection module which allows me to prepare time
cycle projections. Either in calendar days or solar degrees, I then sort the results

into chronological date order reports.

The only problem with this approach, is that, the more cycles you project the
more information you add to the analysis. You can end up with a random

calculation falling on just about every day of the year.

EXAMPLE OF RANDOM CYCLE PROJECTION TECHNIQUES

To illustrate the random approach I have taken 30 major cycles between 1970 and
1992. The projections are in calendar days, all the ratios from chapter 1 are used.

I have produced a report for the year 1994 to show the results.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

To reduce the confusion created by using so many ratios you could reduce the
report to only KEY ratios such as:-

0.333, 0.382, 0.447, 0.500, 0.577, 0.618, 0.667, 0.707, 1.000, 1.4142, 1.618,
2.000

The 1994 high fell on the 3rd February with the bear market low on the 23rd
November 1994. A bear market double bottom fell on 9th February 1995.

The time cycle relationships for the 1994 high and the 1995 low are illustrated in
the TIME ANALYSIS section 4. You can see how much easier trend changes
are to identify, after the event, than with this simple direct wave approach.

To complete the RANDOM APPROACH, projection tables for
ALTERNATE CYCLES are also required.

If one were forecasting a date for the 1994 high you would need to project ratios
of all major expansion cycles from 1974 to 1992 off the 1991 and 1992 low. To
forecast the dates of the 1994 and 1995 lows one needs to project ratios of all
major declines from the 1994 high.

The only Alternate wave projections falling on the 1994 high were 0.667 of the
871111 - 890906 time from the 1992 low and 1.500 times the 910117 - 911111
time from the 1992 low.

It wasn’t surprising that the 23rd November 1994 was a significant low day.
Within a 3 day band Time “squared” 4 prior bear marktets. The important
observation is they related on the Geometric Series, 0.486, 0.618 and 0.786.
Then the 2.000 to 1 with the 1987-88 time range within a degree.

The 9th February 1995 low formed a similar relationship with 3 prior bear market
projections “squaring”, 0.618, 0.786 and 1.000.

The power of Elliott’s theory, “All waves of similar degree will relate in time
amplitude”, becomes more of a reality when you witness situations like this.

The 4 Cycle Wave Projection Approach

If you have not studied past market cycles the best approach to find possible
future dates of importance is to follow a systematical approach. Each future
reversal of trend should relate to TIME ratios of the time between the past 4
market pivot dates of similar degree.

Once you know this is possible you can predict the intersection dates in advance.

The degrees of prior change in trend swings can be reduced to:-
1. Minor

2. Intermediate

3. Major

The way you go about finding the future dates and how strong a harmonic
relationship they have to the past is simple.

1. You project ratio combinations of the cycles already formed in the past
4 market trends, into the future.
2. You can then test dates where vibrations are clustering to see how they

relate to past cycles of Intermediate and Major degree.

Combine 4 Swing Cycles with Alternate Wave Projections

If you follow this practice it is impossible for any important change in trend
“signal day” to escape your analysis. .

Any student of Elliott Wave understands the significance of ALTERNATE WAVE
relationships. Here you are comparing the time in the prior trend of similar
direction to the current trend in progress.

When you project future dates from long term cycles you are better equipped to
filter random and non random dates.

If you want to predict future dates, follow these examples. You can forget
about anything else you have learnt, you don’t need it. If you want to identify
market change in trend dates as they occur you will need a CycleTrader.

Project TIME CYCLE RATIOS of important cycles from relevant chart points

and observe dates where there are clusters of geometric and harmonic
relationships.

The future is only a repetition of the past in some geometric form or ratio. Gann

4 Waves (Quad Wave) of Intermediate Degree Approach

Future change in trend dates should be evident by the ratio relationships found
between the waves of intermediate degree. The Elliott Wave theory states, "All
waves of similar degree will relate in TIME AMPLITUDE". My 4 cycle wave

approach weights the relationships using a scoring approach.

Elliott Wave Counting

The advantage of using an Elliott Wave approach to market swings is that it helps
put the TIME CYCLE calculations into a degree of relative importance.

Over long periods of time the MAJOR DEGREE SWINGS stand out quite
clearly.

The Rhythm Approach

A studious analyst can sometimes (not always) predict whether the future date
calculation will be a market high or low, depénding on the way the past

RHYTHM DATE PROJECTION TECHNIQUE IN THE MINOR DEGREE WAVE STRUCTURE

TIME CYCLE =| 1.908 | 1.618 | 1.008 8.618

Situations like the one that exists above, where a rhythm between 3 swing highs
and the July 96 swing low, allows for an easy calculation of the next rhythm date.

960304 - 970219 = 352 0.382=134 = 970703
960717 - 970219 = 217 0.618=134 = 970703
The continuation of the geometric RHYTHM would give the following dates.
960304 - 970219 = 352 0.618=217 = 970924
960717 - 970219 = 217 1.000=217 = 970924

Future RHYTHM dates could be termed “signal” days or “pressure” days.

Future progressions can be calculated from any 3 points if you found an
arithmetic or harmonic ratio combination signalling a 4th swing high or low.

Search out reliable time sequences

Each of the following time cycle events are now “written in stone” so to speak. If
we use the knowledge gained from the past market movement, the future will be
less complicated for us to analyse.

What I am trying to teach you to do, is to find a MAJOR cycle that has a history
of working a series of ratios into tops or bottoms. Then use it for your future
forecasts.

If you can uncover an existing repetitive pattern in any market it allows you to
become an insider. Next time the same pattern repeats, and the market is in a
position to change trend, it gives you a massive edge.

THE 1982-1991 LOW TO LOW CYCLE IS DEMONSTRATING A
GEOMETRIC RHYTHM GOING INTO TOPS — NEXT PROJECTION
DATES WOULD BE — 1.@@@ - 1.272 — 1.618

Given that the 1982 to 1991, low to low cycle of 3115 days has synchronised
with two subsequent market tops on a projection ratio of 0.618 and 0.786 we can
assume that future "pressure points” will fall on ratios of 1.000, 1.272 and 1.618.

A cycle projection of 1.000 will fall on 29th - 31st July 1999, ie., 3115 days from
the 1991 low date.

The 1.272 or (3115 * 1.272 = 3962 days from the 1991 low) falls on the 22nd
November 2001. The 1.618 ratio projection falls on the 4th November 2004.

These "pressure dates" (within 5 days - because of the long term nature of the
calculations) should be monitored for market "highs", in the case of a low I
would still respect the cycle - but wait for a confirmation.

Example of Future Dates using 2 major Pivots

If you work with MAJOR degree pivots you can be prepared DAYS, WEEKS,
MONTHS and even YEARS in advance.

We already know, from the market activity, that the 1994 high and low were
major reversals of trend basis Elliott Wave. If we were to project ratios of time,
off these two pivots and every prior swing of similar degree, we can isolate
future dates that may be important.

Using the CycleTrader, we can test the future dates and examine how they fit in
with the rest of the market cycles.

Projecting future dates using existing RHYTHM cycles
Take any 1.000 to 1.000, 0.750, 0.707, 0.667, 0.618, 0.500 existing cycle and
check back to see if it has similar rhythm with the past in Arithmetic, Geometric

or Harmonic ratios.

If it does then project the next ratio in the family for a rhythm date.

The double top on 971002 came in as the highest high in the Sydney Futures
Share Price Index. Both 970925 and 971002 are legitimate cycle pivot highs.

These three swing dates - 970403 low - 970703 high and the 971002 high are
square in time, ie., 91 days and 91 days and 87.8 and 87.9 degrees.

On page 12-18 you can see the date projections in degrees, how many students
can calculate these dates by hand. Further on in this section there are tables for
you to use to calculate future dates. Tables are included for both Calendar and

Solar degree time counts.

Identifying RHYTHM and calculating future conjunctions isolates important
future dates.

This technique allows one to eliminate the randomness and noise associated with
simple ratio projection methods.

If you follow my examples you will be able to forecast future dates where market
cycles conjunct and change in trend is possible. If you do your work properly you
should be able to isolate at least 2 days each month where a reversal of trend is
possible. When you get close to the dates the market action will tell you how
important they are going to be.

One word of warning for traders I need to stress is:-

Just because the cycles are conjunct does not in itself mean there will definitely
be a change in trend, the daily patterns will give the hint. There have been many
times I expected to see a change in trend and it did not eventuate. You can use
that to your advantage just the same. If a change in trend does not occur within 1
trading day of your strong conjunctions stay with the prevailing trend for the
cycles are extending.

Counting time by degrees

It is very important to monitor time counts and time cycle relationships in both
CALENDAR days and SOLAR degrees. .

This table will make it easy for you to COUNT time by degrees.
NOTE:

You will have to make an allowance when you are in a leap year for the 29th
February.

EXAMPLE 1.

Time between two dates in the same year:
April 3rd to July 3rd

July 3rd = 182

April 3rd = 94

Difference = 88 degrees

EXAMPLE 2.

Finding a future date in the same year:
February 19th plus 144 degrees

February 19th = 51
= 51+144 = 195
July 17th = 195
EXAMPLE 3.
Finding a future date in another year:
July 3rd plus 216 degrees
July 3rd = 182
= 182+216 = 398
over 360 = 398-360 == 38 in the next year
February 6th = 38
EXAMPLE 4.
Counting degrees between 21st September 1987 and 3rd February 1994
September 21st = 259 December 31st=360  360-259= 101
1988-1993 6 years by 360 360x6 = 2160

Forecasting Future Price Levels For Change
in Trend

Section 3, Price Measuring Techniques provides the basis for the following
techniques.

There are so many ways price highs and lows can relate to each other it makes
the mind bogle. Once one begins to make projections of price levels in minor,

intermediate and primary degree the possibilities become endless.

What we have to work with is the Elliott Wave and Gann Methodologies applied
to waves of similar degree.

The Elliott Wave, Gann and Gilmore procedures we will use are:-

1. Expansions of a prior range.
2. Alternate wave projections.
3. Internal wave projections.

Once all the calculations have been completed you will then have to assess the
results to see how they fit logically.

Let's define the objective:-

To forecast price resistance levels in a rising market.

The best way I can illustrate my method is to recount the calculations I made for
the Sydney Share Price Index, prior to my talk at the SFE Expo in Melbourne on
Monday, May 5th 1997.

At the Expo I gave a 50 minute talk based on Elliott Wave Principles. I
stated in front of 250 odd people I was bullish on the current market
position, and my next major price objective for the Ist Month futures was
2820. The markets all time high at that date had been 2526 just the week
before, 6 points higher than the 19th February 1997 high.

I noted at the time their were a lot of bearish people in the audience.

Each of the charts and price projection levels are self explanatory. Once the
calculations have been observed you look for clusters at the same price level.

You must remember, that prior to these calculations being made, we already have
the knowledge there is an existing Geometry between the ranges we are using.

The target prices calculated in the range 2760-2773 fell in 6 out of the 9 charts,
2820-2830 was projected in 8 out of the 9 charts.

This is not an after the event demonstration, as I am on record, at both the Sth
May 1997, Sydney Futures Exchange, Melbourne Expo, and my own Dynamic
Time and Price Trading Seminar, held in Melbourne Saturday, May 10th 1997. At
both venues I supplied my next major price target for the SPI 1st month futures
as 2820. This is fact, it is written in stone and the calculations were made 5

months in advance.

The market finally reached the outside target of 2827 (intra-day high) on the 2nd

October 1997 and fell 617 points in 26 days.

Forecasting using Percentage Change to Price

In addition to the price projection techniques just explained you can back up your
calculations by calculating important percentage change levels from major highs
and lows.

It is quite common for past highs and lows to "SQUARE" ratio gains and declines
with future change in trend levels.

The Sydney Share Price Index made an exact 100% gain from the 1991 low into
the 1994 high. This would indicate to me that any future "squarings" of these two
levels, ie., 1991 low, 1184 and 1994 high, 2368 would be important. For instance
the 150% level from the 1991 low is the same level as a 25% increase from the
1994 high, 2960. Likewise 200% and 50% would give a target price of 3552.

The same principles also apply for "squaring" percentage declines into lows, refer
to 3-7 and 10.9. The strongest level in a decline is a 50% fall in value.

I have included a table of percentage increases for the SPI for important highs and

lows from the 1991 low up until the Oct 1997 low. You can look for clusters of
levels and evaluate their future relationships with the price projection methods.

How to Forecast Support in the next SPI Bear Market
(2nd Edition)

It is now 18th February 1999 and I have been making additions to this chapter
for a second edition printing. A high of 2963 was made in the SPI on the 4th
February, 1999. Exactly 5 years from the 1994 high.

As yet this high has not been confirmed as a major bull market high, although if
you review all of the prior calculations the 2960 level was a critical resistance
point in this markets structure.

The first step you will take to forecast support for the next MAJOR bear market
is to take the last major range up and calculate ratio retracement levels. This
range begins from the lst September, 1998 low 2360. You can then take the
major ranges starting from:-

28th October, 1997 - low 2210
17th July, 1996 - low 2086
23rd November, 1994 - low 1793
16th November, 1992 - low 134]
17th January, 1991 - low 1184
11th November, 1987 __ - low 1054
CONTRACT LOW 458

A realistic expectation would be a 38.2% retracement of the range beginning from
the 1184 low and the ultimate high.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Previous Bear Market Ranges and % Declines

It will pay you to become familiar with the point and % change declines, in prior
bear markets of similar degree, as future declines will most likely relate to one or
more of them.

For instance the major bear markets and sharp declines in the Share Price Index
have been:-

1987 crash 1333.5 55.9%
1989 - 199] 671 36.2%
1992 378 22%

1994 575 24.3%
1997 617 21.8%
1998 561 19.2%

Falls in value of between 19% and 24% are common and should be viewed as a
minimum objective in any future bear market.

I would also repeat these processes for the Cash (All Ordinaries Index) and
monitor them as well.

1970 - 1974 275 61.3%
1980 - 1982 303 40.6%
1987 crash 1163 50.3%
1989 - 1991 587 32.9%
1992 342 20.2%
1994 535 22.8%
1997 587 21%

1998 508 17.6%

An interesting co-incidence I have observed is that you can add some of these
together and relate them as groups. For instance 275+303+587 = 1165,
587+342+535 = 1464 and 303+1163 = 1466.

In any case, always bear in mind the Elliott Wave Theory of markets, which
suggests, any major decline in prices should terminate in the vicinity of the 4th
wave of lesser degree. In the case of the Australian Share Market this would be
somewhere between the 1994 high 2368, and the 1994 low 1793, basis the Share
Price Index.

Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd (Updated)

In an earlier section of this manual I used BHP to demonstrate ways to count
Elliott Waves. At the time of printing the 1st edition of this manual, BHP was
entrenched in a bear market which began from a double top at $20.05 on the 20th
June, 1997. See 11-7 which was written over a year ago.

Over the past year the decline continued with major restructuring taking place
within the company. On the 15th December 1998, BHP made low at $10.62 and
has held this support for over 2 months.

It looks like the rot has been contained and the technical position is perfect as the
50% retracement for a IV wave of cycle degree has terminated in the vicinity of
the 4th wave of lesser degree.

Alternately if the low of $10.62 is taken out the next support is at the 50%
retracement of the range up from the 1974 low or at the 50% decline in value
from the June 20, 1997 high.

Planetary Cycles

The seasons spring, summer, fall and winter, on the Earth, are the direct effect of
our planetary movement around the Sun. Tidal movement is the result of gravity
forces from the Moon in orbit around the Earth.

There is a line of thought called financial astrology that claims market cycles can
be predicted from the planetary cycles and planetary aspects.

Personally, I have witnessed instances, where the length of a bull market or bear
market has terminated in the time of a Mercury, Venus or Mars year or a ratio
thereof. I'm not so sure that one needs to utilize this information in an analysis,
but I will provide the necessary information anyway.

Planetary Years
The planets of our solar system orbit the Sun; planets in order of closest to
furtherest from the Sun are:-

SUN Days Years
Mercury 88

Venus 225

Earth 365 1
Mars 687 1.88
Jupiter 433] 11.86
Saturn 29.46
Uranus 84.01
Neptune 164.7
Pluto 247.69

Planets travel around the Sun in eliptical paths speeding up and slowing down the
rate of travel through the circle of 360 degrees relative to calendar days.

This means that a fraction of a year, say 90° of the orbit, will be longer or shorter
in calendar days than another segment of 90°.

It is important for new students of financial astrology to understand how to plot
the positions of the planets. For this we use an Ephemeris.

Planetary Cycles 14-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Heliocentric Planetary Positions

CycleTrader contains an ephemeris to plot planetary positions between 4000 BC
and 4000 AD.

The 0° (degree) of the circle represents the location of the Earth and Sun at the
September 22nd, Equinox. 90° is the December 22nd, Solstice.
180° is the March 21st, Equinox. 270° is the June 21st, Solstice.

An Equinox occurs twice a year when the Earth is on equal plane, ie., upright in
axis with the Sun - Daylight hours are equal to darkness hours.

A Solstice occurs twice a year and marks when the Earth is at maximum tilt to the
Sun - It is either the shortest daylight hours or longest daylight hours of the year,
depending on which side of the equator you live on.

W.D. Gann taught that the Equinox and Solstice dates were important natural
cycle dates and it was possible to get a change of trend on these dates in seasonal
markets.

Geocentric Planetary Positions

Geocentric planetary positions relate to the co-ordinates of the planets relative to
someone on Earth looking out at the location of the planets.

The 0° (degree) position of the Sun represents the March 21st, Equinox. The Sun
to Earth angles are 180° opposed to the heliocentric co-ordinates.

The other planets co-ordinates from Earth have to be calculated by vectors from
their heliocentric position relative to the Sun and the Earth's position.

Much of the work I have seen on financial astrology is based on geocentric
planetary cycles. One approach available is a book by Donald Bradley, "Stock
Market Prediction". Another is "Astro-economics" written by L.J. Jensen.

Astro Economics is the study of regular economic cycles as they relate to
planetary positions. Some schools of thought have devised ways of weighting
planetary aspects as either positive or negative. Results are compared with the
past and future predictions are based on the past observations.

Planetary Aspects

An Aspect is the term given to an angular relationship (degrees in the 360° circle)
between two planets when sighted from a third planetary body.

There are 8 aspects of importance according to JOHANNES KEPLER (1571-1630).

CONJUNCT 0° 360° RATIOS
SEXTILE 60° 1:5 60:300
QUINTILE 72° 1:4 72:288

BIQUINTILE 144° 2:3 144:216
OPPOSITION 180° 1:1 180:180

The 90° aspect is often referred to as SQUARE.

This is most probably the origin of W.D. Gann's Time by Degree counts. Not
because of the aspects, but because of Kepler's laws of mathematical form. If you
view the RATIOS column, I have inserted, it all appears to fit like a glove.

Perigee, Apogee, Equinox and Solstice

The Perigee is the point in a planets orbit where it reaches its closest distance to
the Sun. .

The Apogee is the point in a planets orbit where it reaches its furthermost
distance from the Sun.

Earth's perigee occurs in early January and the apogee in early July. The rate of
change between degrees and calendar days progressively speeds up between the
apogee and the perigee. Likewise it progressively slows down between the
perigee and the apogee.

The Perigee, January 3rd, each year is another cyclic date to remember for a
possible change in trend.
The Apogee, July 4th, each year is also equally important.

Solstice and Equinox dates are also important natural cycle dates each year.
Equinoxes fall on September 22 and March 21, Solstices fall on December 22 and
June 22 each year, within 1 day.

Lunar Cycles - Solar Eclipse

The new Moon occurs every 29.53 days, so does the full Moon, they are 14.76
days apart, and never vary. .

The gravity effect of the Moon's position in its orbit creates a variation for the
tidal forces on the Earth. The gravity effect is not restricted to the oceans but also
to the Earth's crust. It has been proven that the most forceful effect of the Moon is
at the new Moon period when the Moon is directly between the Sun and the
Earth. This is the time when the Sun and the Moon join forces with their gravity
effect

Gravity effects water more visually than any other Earth bound compound, and as
we know water is the life blood of the planet. People are 80% water!

The solar eclipse cycle is normally every 177 days or 6 new moons. Although it
can reduce to 5 or expand to 7 cycles. The most powerful effects are felt when
the Moon is exactly on the same latitude to the Sun as the Earth is.

I have seen numerous articles endeavouring to correlate market change in trend
with new and full moons, perhaps the most outstanding are those correlations
with the new Moon on a solar eclipse.

My recommendation is that every market timer should monitor the new Moon
periods and the solar eclipse dates and see how they figure in the dynamic time
cycles of that market.

The technical public have already been conditioned to look to “buy on a full
Moon and sell on a new Moon".

A SOLAR ECLIPSE OCCURS AT THE TIME OF IHE NEW MOON WHEN THE EARTH
AND THE MOON ARE ON THE SAME LATITUDE WITH THE SUN.

Lunar Eclipse

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon is behind the Earth on the same latitude
and the shadow of the Earth causes the full moon to go into darkness. If this
phenomena occurs at night it has an unsettling effect on nature.

In my research of market activity I have not really found the lunar eclipse to be
anymore useful, as a signal day, than an ordinary full moon.

Nevertheless it is in everyone's interest to monitor such activity and examine how
these times fit into the dynamic structure of each market.

When dynamic cycle times and natural cycle times CONJUNCT then it could be a
very important time signal, always be observant.

In the past I have given examples of these cycles, at major market highs and lows,
and the information has had a lot of merit. The problem I now have with years of
research, is I have not been able to quantify how to use this information in a
trading plan. You can see for yourself the hit and miss record these cycles have.

My methods of analysis these days are strictly dynamic for each market as it plots
its own course. I believe that if the planetary cycles are valid they will be evident
within the market structure as it unfolds.

My current view is to use dynamic time and price analysis, if you at least
understand the planetary phenomena, it may from time to time have a natural
cause and effect on the markets you are trading. Each market creates its own
cycles, the planetary influence may be a factor, but the dynamic ratio analysis of
time will over-ride any natural cycle date.

If you get a natural cycle date such as an apogee, perigee, solar eclipse,

equinox or solstice coinciding with strong rhythmic dynamic time cycles,
then you could say you have a very strong tradeable signal.

Venus - Earth - Sun Aspects

Perhaps the most inviting phase I have noted within the study of planetary cycles
is the way ASPECTS can often coincide with some major market tops and
bottoms.

The Venus - Earth synodical period is fairly consistent at 584 days,
ie., the Venus - Earth - Sun angles return to their same position every 584 days.

From this sample the most powerful angular relationships for Venus appear to be
1:1 at opposition - 180, 1:5 at sextile - 60 and 1:2 at trine - 120 degrees.

The Mars - Earth synodical period is an inconsistent cycle in as much as Mars has
an irregular elliptical orbit around the Sun. Donald Bradley in "Stock Market
Prediction” lists the cycle as 2.1354 years, ie., 780 days. The synodical time
between the Conjunctions of 12th February, 1995 and 17th March, 1997 shown
below took 764 days, 2.093 years. The half cycle to 4th March, 1996 opposition

All Ordinaries Index - Heliocentric Study 1994-1996

To assist your research and information, I have prepared some ephemerid tables
by quarter years 1994 through to the middle of 1996. This study is intended as an
example of how you may explore coincidences of planetary positions at market
change in trend dates. I don't wish to influence anyone's opinion so I am leaving
this work to the student.

Planetary positions are calculated on the hour for each day at GMT - Greenwich
Mean Time, this is on the 0° longitude, the meridian passing through Greenwich,
England where the Sun crosses each day at noon.

Ephemeris time is based on the circle of 360° , but each day count is based on our
normal daily clock (Universal Time). Midday is an even number and midnight is
on the 0.5 increments.

If you wanted, you could get the exact minute of the aspects forming. For my
research work within 1 hour of orb is satisfactory.

You can study the data and the charts to arrive at your own conclusions.

As the planets get further away from the Earth the synodical periods lessen to just
over a year.

Planetary Cycles 14-33
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

Summary

My purpose for explaining the planetary cycles in such detail has not been to
reach any undeniable conclusions, simply to put the facts forward in the manner I
have been observing for the past 10 years. My experience is that planetary
positions have some bearing on natural cyclic events, yet because of the number
of planetary events it remains difficult for me to forecast a market reversal of
trend based on such criteria.

During the 16 years I have been in this business I have met many financial
astrologers and Astro-economic analysts, each provides a good argument as to
why they can forecast market changes of trend with their techniques. On the
whole most of them were or are newsletter writers, not traders.

I have found from past experience that it doesn't pay me to get to carried away
with the importance of planetary cycles. I already have the mathematical
approach taken from the actual market history that works so well.

It has taken me considerable time researching, various markets at their high and
low dates, for evidence I could apply in a trading plan. At present I don't believe I
can use this information reliably, it still retains a random appearance to me. Yet it
is possible these cycles are at work in an oblique manner, which is difficult to
understand.

Any student of time analysis requires to be aware, I hope what I have provided
here does that at least.

My advice is to do your own research and arrive at your own conclusions.

Helio-centric SQUARE Aspects for 1998 - 2010

As an assistance I am including tables from 1998 through to 2010. But to save
space and confusion I am not including new moon or full moon dates, these are
easy to monitor. The tables list 0° - Conjunct, 90° - Square, 180° - Opposition,
solar eclipse and lunar eclipse. If you wish to know 60°, 72°, 120° and 144°
aspects the CycleTrader software will allow it.

For the best part, this information should be enough for you to reach a conclusion
as to the value of these cycle dates.

Epilogue

You are now privy to the most valuable information you will ever experience in
this lifetime. Information that's priceless, yet it's only priceless if you do your own
work and understand the underlying geometric principle.

To take advantage of the knowledge I have imparted to you will initially require
some hard work. You will have to become familiar with the ratios and special
numbers of the universe. These ratios and numbers need to become second nature
to you.

You will need:-

A computer system.

A long term daily data base of commodity and stock prices.

A data provider from which you can update your data base electronically.
A secluded working environment.

Charting and analysis software.

AWN

I have often heard people say, "As soon as I make some money from the market I
will set myself up properly."

If you don't set yourself up properly in the beginning all you are doing is wasting
time. Please don't put the cart before the horse. Every business enterprise has a
set up cost, if you can't afford the cost then you can't afford to trade.

I've done my best to show you how it can be done, you must now do your best
and take advantage. If you want to make it easy for yourself you will need a
CycleTrader, there is no other program available that will do the job properly.

Summary 15-1
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

On a day to day basis it will be most advantageous to follow between 10 and 15
markets. Try and study a cross section of markets which will give you a spread of
opportunity.

For instance:-

SFE - Sydney Share Price Index - SPI
SFE - Three year bonds - YB
SFE - Ten Year bonds - XB
COMEX - Gold

COMEX< - Silver

IMM - Australian dollar

IMM - Swiss Franc

IMM - Deutsche Mark

IMM - Japanese Yen

IMM - British Pound

CBOT - 10 year T-Bonds
CBOT - Soybeans

CBOT - Wheat

Stocks such as:-

BHP - Broken Hill

MIM - Mount Isa Mines

CBA - Commonwealth Bank
NAB - National Australia Bank

As each market makes new highs and lows you can explore the technical signals
which could act as a reason why the current trend will reverse.

When you can sight odds on opportunities to trade against the prevailing trend
you will get a jump start on the crowd. If you can't find a technical reason for a
change in trend then only trade with the trend.

Each day you must examine:-

The PATTERN of the market.

The position of the TREND indicators.

The relationship of the long term TIME CYCLES.

The relationship of the medium term TIME CYCLES.

The relationship of the PRICE expansions and retracements.
The relationship of the Dynamic VIBRATION angles.

AWE WND

If you do all of these things opportunity will present itself time and time again.
When opportunity is not present stay out of the market.........

Summary 15-2
Dynamic Time & Price Analysis of Market Trends

In your spare time STUDY past market cycles and look for RHYTHM
OPPORTUNITIES that maybe coming up. If you are prepared in advance
with your timing signals you will find it a lot easier to pull the trigger at the
right moment.

Try and get to understand the CHARACTERISTICS of the markets you are
following.

Keep abreast of Commodity and Stock fundamental influences - I now watch
the Bloomberg business channel on Foxtel whenever I'm in my office, it
Saves me reading the paper from cover to cover. When I lived in Los
Angeles I used to watch their business channel.

The lesser degree ratios will become important only when cycles of price or time are measured
over long periods.
When dealing with shorter time and price periods then use only the primary ratios as important

to the immediate geometry, ie., 0.382, 0.50, 0.577, 0.618 et cetera.

In cases where the geometry is unclear check for "other ratios", ie., factors of ratios made up
from ratios multiplied by other ratios. It is rare that a major change in trend will occur on this
geometry, but it must be considered when all else does not provide the answer!!!
