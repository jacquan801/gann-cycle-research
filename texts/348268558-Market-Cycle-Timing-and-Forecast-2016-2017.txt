Market Cycle Timing and Trend Direction are the keys to unlock
trading and investing success




Cycles may be defined as any phenomena repeating after fairly regular time
intervals.

Generally cycles are found in anything to which numerical measurements may be
assigned at intervals in time. Edward Dewey of the Foundation for the Study of
Cycles said that every field studied had been found to have cycles

Make sure you Read the charts below to get yourself well informed and convinced
about Cycle Timing!!!

Almost everybody loses big money in the big down turn or crash like 1987, 2000,
2008 and 2011! We all have a short term memory of 2008 GFC when Dow losing
60% plus within a few months…just recall it and think how many people were losing
money. Citibank drops from about $57 in 2006 to less than $1.00 in 2008. This is a
big lesson we all must remember and not to commit the same mistake again!

To avoid from being caught in the big plunge or missing from the big rally, we all
must know that ‘there is a time for everything’ (Eccl3)

There is a time to buy and a time to sell. We all need to know the probable cycle top
to avoid getting slaughtered during the corrective plunge during the panic or crash
cycle. Similarly, we all need to know when to get in early to buy ( and make big
monies) and ride on the bullish Cycle that can last for weeks, months or even years.

As an investor or traders you also need to identify the trend direction and the turning
points in order to make consistent profits. You got to be one of the smartest people
on your street when it comes to knowing the trend of the market and the turning
points. Do not ignore my 4 elements of analysis – Cycle Timing, Technical,
Fundamental and Sentiment analysis.

Will 2008 GFC happen again? Why not? There is nothing new under the sun…the
human behaviour, passion, fear or greed never change.

Come and join us to embrace fundamental, technical, sentiments analysis and most
important of all CYCLE TIMING MATHEMATICAL MODELS to protect you from
being ruined in the next great ‘crash cycle’ and most importantly join us to make
consistent money.

Predicting or Forecast sometimes is called "A Fool's Game". In a way it is true but if I
can show you it is mathematical and logical, you may be amazed with it’s uncannily
accuracy. It is mathematical because it involves numbers like angles, Fibonacci and
historical timing pattern. It is logical because it is based on human emotion whose
behaviour and passion never change. And also, any elected governments basically
continue to commit the same policy mistakes again and again.

How I used the Fibonacci calculation to predict the May high in 2015?

Critical inflection Points Using Fibonacci calculation (INCREDIBLY ACCURATE)

      September 1929 (crash from Peak) - June 1962 (next long term inflection
       point) spans 393 months
      393 × .382 = 150 June 1962 + 150 months = December 1974
      393 x .618 = 242.9 June 1962 + 242 months = August 1982
      393 x 1.00 = 393 June 1962 + 393 months = March 1995
      393 x 1.382 = 543.126 June 1962 + 544 months = October 2007
      393 x 1.618 = 635.87 June 1962 + 635 months = May 2015
      June 1962 + 636 months = June 2015

Now, Let’s me also show you some simple charts (self-explanatory) below, to prove
my points about Cycle turning points (or from the cycle top or bottom) and why they
are the keys to trading and investing success – A time to buy and A time to sell!!!

Before you read my forecasts, you should understand the actual application and the
true meaning of Cycle Timing.

As the world’s situation (geopolitical conflicts, government’s policies and intervention,
human sentiments (mass psychology) may change, Cycle (wave length and
amplitude) occasionally may contract, expand and even invert. It actually means bull
cycle or bear cycle (Cycle high or low) may come earlier or delayed. Occasionally,
the anticipated Cycle low may become Cycle high or vice versa. Example, expected
Gold major low around April 2016 could happen (extended to) in April 2017. In price,
expected major low in April could become a Cycle high if the Cycle wave length is
extended.

I don’t mean that it must happen and fortunately enough, with the given reliable data
and accurate analysis, the frequency of forecasts change is very low and if we do
need to adjust it, we should be able to see ahead (at least in weeks) whether the
Cycle behaviour is going to change.

However to produce and maintain consistent top/accurate forecasts, it is critically
important to monitor and adjust (if warranted). A lot of hard works and time are
needed to do regular updates (at least weekly) which are essential to keep us on the
right track in the events of the possible Cycle trend change. That is why, I strongly
suggest you subscribe Premium Newsletter to update yourself (at least
weekly) and to make sure you won’t miss the Bull Cycle (if you Buy Long) and
the Bear Cycle (if you short)

My Quarterly Forecast - January 2016 – March 2016

1. Gold and Silver – bearish on the first quarter of 2016 followed by bullish quarters
till 2017. Please note that it is not a straight bull cycle. It may expand and even
invert. You need to follow my weekly update to see if Gold major low is going to be
extended to 2017. You must keep track of the ongoing developments with regular
analysis and monitoring so that we know when to buy at a better time. We don’t want
to get stuck with the investment for too long if the Cycle low delayed to 2017.
However, if the Cycle low extended, we should continue to focus on SHORTS

2. SP500, DOW, NDX, ASX – bearish on the first 4 months of 2016 followed by
bullish months till the first quarters of 2017. Currently, they are still exhibiting
irregular wave pattern within the basing pattern. My key monitor of these indices are
the possible Cycle Inversion. If that happens, we might see another panic plunge.
Follow my weekly update should help you to be on the right track all the time
3. USD and EURO –USD is very bullish till the end of 2016 and EURO is doomed. I
have no doubt about the bullish cycle of USD. It is possible for USD and Gold to go
up for a certain period of time. Regular analysis and weekly update should help us to
pre-determined when that rare scenario is going to happen.

4. AUDUSD is going lower to 60

4. OIL – should bottom around 33 and then consolidate in between 33-48 for the rest
of 2016

5. All other markets like YEN, DAX, NIKKEI, SSEC, Natural Gas, etc will be covered
in the monthly newsletter and occasionally in the weekly updates.

The details of the above forecasts like the date of specific turning points, trend
direction and the best time to buy and sell are covered in Daily Update, Weekly
Reports and Monthly Newsletter.

Over the years, I used 7 Cycle Timing Methodologies to identify the turning
points and one of the methods is W.D. Gann’s mater time factor

W.D. Gann taught that the best way to predict the future is to have an understanding
of the past. W.D. Gann who had more than 50 years of experience in financial
markets and did research dating back hundreds of years. What he found to his
satisfaction was that history repeats, and the past is the best predictor of future
prices. His forecasts of time cycles over a half century proved to be accurate
because those cycles are based on human nature, which does not change.
                         W.D GANN MASTER TIME FACTOR

W.D. Gann, attained legendary status as a “Guru of Wall Street” between 1900 and
1955.

He demonstrated an uncanny ability to forecast major market turning points. His
forecast of the 1929 bull market top in the stock market nine months before the high
is a matter of record, having been published in his yearly forecast for 1929. Probably,
he could have made about $2 billion in today’s money.

Let’s review some of his methodology “Master Time Factor” taught to all of us.

Gann’s MASTER TIME FACTOR

“By a study of the time cycles you will learn why tops and bottoms are formed at
certain times. Everything moves in cycles as a result of the natural law of action and
reaction. By a study of the past, I have discovered what cycles repeat in the future.
In order to be accurate in forecasting the future, you must know the major cycles.
The most money is made when fast moves and extreme fluctuations occur at the
end of major cycles. I have experimented and compared past markets in order to
locate the major and minor cycles and determine in what years the cycles repeat in
the future.”

The law of vibration enabled me to accurately determine the exact points to which
stocks and commodities should rise and fall. By studying time cycles, you will learn
why tops and bottoms are formed at certain times. In order to be accurate we must
know the major cycles. Always consider the annual forecast and whether the big
time limit has run out before judging a reverse move.

Everything moves in cycles as a result of natural law of action and reaction. The
cause can be determined years in advance. The future is but a repetition of the past,
as the Bible plainly states, “the thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
which is done, is that which shall be done, and there is no new thing under the sun.”
(Ecclesiastes. 1:9). By a study of the past, I have discovered what cycles repeat in
the future. In order to be accurate in forecasting the future, you must know the major
cycles. The most money is made when fast moves and extreme fluctuations occur at
the end of major cycles. I have experimented and compared past markets in order to
locate the major and minor cycles and determine in what years the cycles repeat in
the future.

Time is the most important factor in determining market movements because the
future is a repetition of the past and each market movement is working out time in
relation to some previous Time Cycle.
Gann referred to the “Great Cycle – Master Time Period – 60-Years the 49-50
Year Cycle, and the 30 Year Cycle (see chapter #12).

Great Cycle – Master Time Period – 60 Years: “This is the greatest and most
important cycle of all, which repeats every 60 years or at the end of the third 20-Year
Cycle. You will see the importance of this by referring to the war period from 1861 to
1869 and the panic following 1869: also 60 years later – 1921 to 1929 – the greatest
bull market in history and the greatest panic in history followed. This proves the
accuracy and value of this great time period.”

45-Year Cycle: “The digits 1 to 9 when added together total 45. 45 is the most
important angle. Therefore 45 years in time is a very important cycle. One-half of 45
is 22 ½ years or 270 months. One-fourth of 45 is 11 ½ years or 135 months, which is
three times 45. You will note how important these points are on the 360 degree
Circle Chart.”

30-Year Cycle: “The 30-Year Cycle is very important because it is one-half of the
60-year cycle or Great Cycle and contains three 10-year cycles. In making up an
annual forecast you should always make a comparison with the record 30 years
back.”

20-Year Cycle: “One of the most important Time Cycle is the 20-year cycle or 240
months. Most stocks and the averages work closer to this cycle than to any other.
Refer to analysis of the “20-Year Forecasting Chart.”

84-Year Cycle: “This repeated 84 years from 1845 to 1852 and brought low prices in
1929 to 1933.” The 84-Year Cycle alerts us to be prepared for low prices 84-Years
from 1929 to 1933. The 84-Year Cycle projects low prices in 2013 to 2017.

W.D. Gann also observed what he came to call “the decade cycle”. In his many
commodity and stock market courses, he described the decade cycle this way: By
studying the yearly high and low chart and going back over a long period of time, you
will see the years in which bull markets culminate and the years in which bear
markets begin and end. Each decade, or 10-year cycle, which is one-tenth of 100
years, marks an important campaign… In referring to these numbers and these
years, we mean the calendar years. To understand this, study 1891 to 1900, 1901
to 1910, 1911 to 1920, 1921 to 1930 and 1931 to 1939. The ten year cycle
continues to repeat over and over, but the greatest advances and declines occur at
the end of the 20-year and 30year cycles, and again at the end of the 50-year and
60-year cycles, which are stronger than the others.

Year
1. A year in which a bear market ends and a bull market begins. 1901, 1911, 1921.
2. The second year is a year of a minor bull market, or a rally in a bear market will
start at some time. 1902, 1912, 1922, 1932.
3. Starts a bear year, but the rally from the second year may run to March or April
before culmination, or a decline from the 2nd year may run down and make bottom
in February or March, like 1933. 1903, 1913, 1923.
4. The fourth year is a bear year, but ends the bear cycle and lays the foundation for
a bull market. Compare 1904, 1914.
5. The fifth year is the year of Ascension, and a very strong year for a bull market.
See 1905, 1915, 1925, 1935.
6. The sixth year is a bull year, in which a bull campaign which started in the fourth
year ends in the Fall of the year and a fast decline starts. See 1896, 1906, 1916,
1926.
7. Seven is a bear number and the seventh year is a bear year because 84 months
or 840 degrees is 7/8ths of 90. See 1897, 1907, 1917, but note 1927 was the end of
a 60 year cycle, so not much of a decline.
8. The eighth year is a bull year. Prices start advancing in the 7th year and reach
the 90th month in the 8th year. This is very strong and a big advance usually takes
place. Review 1898, 1908, 1918, 1928. (2008 did not follow this pattern, which is
where a little real estate cycle knowledge was helpful in this instance.)
9. Nine is the highest digit and the ninth year is the strongest of all for the bull
markets. Final bull campaigns culminate in this year after extreme advances and
prices start to decline. Bear markets usually start in September to November at the
end of the 9th year and a sharp decline takes place. See 1869, 1879, 1889, 1899,
1909, 1919 and 1929, the year of the greatest advances, culminating in the fall of
that year, followed by a sharp decline.
10. Ten is a bear year. A rally often runs until March and April; then a severe decline
runs to November and December, when a new cycle begins and another rally starts.
See 1910, 1920, 1930.
