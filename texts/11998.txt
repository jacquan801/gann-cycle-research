   An Introduction to Gann Signs in TTTTA:

Many of you have spent countless hours pouring
over Gann's notes, with little result. This
has left many disillusioned, about Gann and
his methods. Hopefully, we can cut to the
chase here, as you take a guided tour through
"Tunnel thru the Air" and other Gann works.

W.D.Gann's "The Tunnel Thru the Air" has been
studied by generations of traders, since he
wrote it in 1927.

Whilst there has been much conjecture about
the veiled messages contained in his text,
there has been little evidence published to
support the theory, that some PRACTICAL
astrotools were disguised in the TTTTA text.

Gann concealed his methods in coded messages,
since he knew that the world was not ready
for the implications of his work, in 1927.

As we progress through this exercise, you
will see that he was quite correct and even
now, some "Gannsters" have been critical of
the release of this information, at all.

Since decoding the messages, held in TTTTA,
it has become apparent, that this knowledge
is being revealed ..... just when, mankind
needs it most.

That may sound melodramatic on my part, but
if you care to bear with me throughout this
ebook, you will no doubt, come to the same
conclusion ..... these cycles can be applied
to ALL walks of life, traders included.

In an effort to unravel these astrotools, we
will complete an indepth exploration of the
contents of TTTTA and discuss how these methods
may be employed in our trading plan and giving
REAL trading examples, where possible.

Decoding most of Gann's messages requires some
expertise in astrology and several other skills,
like bible code interpretations. Some students
would add tarot to this list, but this point
has some Gannsters, truly up in arms.

Before dedicating my time to decoding TTTTA,
my approach to the bible was NOT as a devout
Christian.

Now, my approach is the same, but it is also evident
that both books spell out messages to the world that
have been previously hidden for thousands of years.
                                                INTRODUCTION


Many other ancient books will also be viewed
differently in the future, as a result of
Gann's work.

To understand my approach to decoding TTTTA,
let us simply say ... Gann WANTED THESE
METHODS TO BE REVEALED, therefore we should
look for SIMPLE explanations, where possible.

Overcomplicating the interpretations was NOT
Gann's intent, though some of the messages
have been cleverly hidden.

As TTTTA is contained in 418 pages of coded
messages, you will appreciate that it will
take many pages to explain how those messages
are decoded ..... that does not include, any
explanation of how the methods may be used
in a PRACTICAL way, by traders.

There are many tangents and detours that
present themselves in this work that need
to be explored further, if we aspire to
even greater knowledge ..... my work is
not presented as the holy grail, but it
IS one more step, along the path to our
acquisition of infinite wisdom.

Everything presented here, is still subject
to normal copyright laws and your observance
of these laws will be greatly appreciated.

This work will be available for sale to
the public in the future, both on CD-ROM
and online, as a newsletter.

Many thanks for your interest in my work.

It is my pleasure to be the messenger.

                                                         INTRODUCTION




Where to start our search for the TRUTH:

Up front, all astrocharts used here were calculated,
using a ONE degree orb, so there is little room for
cheating or vague interpretation of the aspects shown.

Recently, we posted the chart below, it shows an
important pattern, associated with 144 degrees.

Our chart shows, how the moon triggered biquintile
(144 degrees) aspects made with Uranus,
Pluto and Vesta to form a five-pointed
"pentacle star", on the afternoon before
the US and Australia joined forces, in the
"pre-emptive strikes" on Iraq, in March 2003.




..... air strikes, that were supposed to kill Saddam
and his sons, while they ate.

Study Note: Further information about the 5-pointed star
              may be found in the following books:

              "Astrology and the Old Testament."- Karl Anderson.

              "The Kabala of Numbers" - Sepharial.
                                                       INTRODUCTION




So, it is interesting to pursue this train of
thought, about Pluto, a little further ... first,
Gann's natal chart shows Pluto at 25:29 Taurus
and this degree is the first important clue we
will have in decoding "Tunnel thru the Air".

Pluto was not even discovered, when Gann
wrote "Tunnel" and like the ancient astrologers,
Gann's work focused on the two luminaries, Sun
and Moon and 5 other planets, outwards-to Saturn.

In the charts ahead however, we will see how
Pluto can help us delineate some of the geometry,
in our astrocharts.




You will also notice the two 144 degree biquintile aspects
and other prominent aspects, including 5 x tredeciles
(108 degrees), 2 x trines (120), 2 x squares (90), an
opposition (180) and a quincunx (150) .....
                                                          INTRODUCTION




Now, if we consider Gann's natal chart (inner) and combine
it with a chart on June 6th 2006 (outer), we will see that
Pluto has journeyed through 210 degrees, in 128 years and
makes an exact quincunx to its natal position on 06062006.

Pluto is also conjunct the Galactic Centre at that time,
so we are likely to see full exposure of Gann's work by
then ..... along with a lot of other astrological details.

So, between 06 June 2006 and 31 December 2006 should be
an interesting time for both traders and astrologers.

Given that Pluto relates to the "underground", we should
also consider the 100 year anniversary of the April 1906
San Francisco earthquake ..... TTTTA Chapter 1, Page 1.




Of course, there's lots more to be found in the astrocharts,
including Gann's own natal and anniversary charts .....

Luckily, we have been able to draw on expert astrologers,
to help us unravel the deeper interpretations of these
charts ..... you will meet one of them, in the next
section of this book.
                                                       INTRODUCTION




Consider this chart, on Gann's anniversary on 6th June 2006,
this time we see 5 biquintile aspects, with 7 major planets
involved ..... including Pluto, Vesta, Uranus, Moon, Saturn,
Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Earth ..... many of these same
planets figured prominently in Gann's natal chart and our
chart, showing the "pentacle star" ... more on that, later.




..... you will also notice, that the parallel biquintiles are
36 degrees apart and there's also two semisquare aspects that
figure prominently, between the main players, also aspected
by the biquintiles.

June 06, 2006 may mark another significant conflict or event
on the global calendar ... you can find out why this forecast
should stand up and WHERE it will take place ... be sure to
read, this series of books on decoding TTTTA and how important
TTTTA really is, especially in terms of global peace.


06-06-06 = 666 ???

-----
                                                          INTRODUCTION


Aside from the biquintile aspects of 144 degrees,
there's many other associations that can be made
with the number 144 and our zodiac.

Of interest to some traders, will be the "wheels-within-wheels"
concept, which originated in India and treats each sign as
a mini-zodiac sign.

For example, our normal zodiac is represented by 30 degrees for
each sign, but the Indians break each 30 degree sign down into
a mini-zodiac, each signs spanning 2.5 degrees and using the same
names for all 12 signs. Each of these signs is called a dwad.

So, with a further 12 signs inside each original zodiac sign,
then there becomes 144 divisions in the zodiac, in total.

For more on this method, go to:

http://koti.mbnet.fi/neptunia/essays/dwadchl.htm

-----

Some traders will see these divisions, as being akin to the
decanates in a western astrochart ... and in fact, there is
a unique association between the two methods, that can be
measured quite accurately.

Later, we can look at more 144 associations too, especially
with regard to TIME !~!

Lots more later, this is just the beginning of our journey.

-----

Recently, some traders have asked for a study guide, to
help them sort out the wood from the trees.

As we progress, there will be many links to online
resources, that can help in your quest for more
general knowledge, as well as trading know-how.

Whilst the original sources of Gann's research would be
a huge advantage to us, they are NOT absolutely essential
for decoding TTTTA or understanding Gann's trading methods.
MOST IMPORTANT:

Your progress ahead, will be hampered significantly, if you
do not have a grasp of SIMPLE astrology, BASIC geometry
and mathematics !~!

My work, presented in the volumes ahead, will assume that
you have already done your homework and have some basic
skills, in all of these sciences.

It has become evident, that Gann uncovered a branch of
science that has been hidden for thousands of years. To
understand his work will take both DISCIPLINE and EFFORT.

Be sure to read the FAIR WARNINGS, at the end of this book.

Study Suggestions - W.D. Gann's Reading List:

W.D. Gann's recommended reading list below, was released to
students, about 1946 and it the obvious basis of study,
for any serious "Gannster" to get familiar with his works.

However, since those days, the original list has become
corrupted due to additions by well meaning (or greedy)
Gann-industry distributors and bookshops.

Some of the books below may be difficult to obtain, but
don't despair, you will learn in this series, that we
can unravel Gann's methods, quite easily without using
many of the Gann's original list, at all.
                                                                  INTRODUCTION

There’s many more old books, that may have some general
educational value, but for most of us, there’s a limit
on the amount of time, we can devote to such studies.

Don’t worry too much, if you can’t secure any of the
books listed above, as you will see references for some
modern books and online references, will be posted,
as we progress through Gann’s works.

Here’s some, that may help to focus your study on the
important issues:

Essential reading - recent books:
There’s a few books that you will need to READ
and UNDERSTAND, before tackling Gann’s astro works.

Mostly, they are small and inexpensive, so that’s
really good news.

To understand basic astrology, these will help:

First Steps to Astrology … Bernadette Brady/D.Gunzburg

The Art of Astrology … Sheila Geddes

Parker’s Astrology … Julia and Derek Parker

Sun, Earth, Moon … Robin Heath

Star Signs … Linda Goodman

Quintiles and Tredeciles … Dusty Bunker

The Book of the Eclipse … David Ovason

Oahsphe - Dr John Newborough

Any astrology books by Georgia Stathis and Pia Barnett.

-----

To understand sacred geometry and simple maths:

Useful Mathematical and Physical Formulae … Matthew Watkins

Sacred Geometry … Miranda Lundy

Sacred Geometry … Robert Lawlor
                                                        INTRODUCTION



City of Revelation … John Michell

The Keys to the Temple … David Furlong

Progressive Plane Geometry … Wells and Hart

To understand numerology and astrology links:

The Cycles of Time … John Tatler.



Numerology and the Divine Triangle … Faith Javane/Dusty Bunker
Other requirements to achieve a full understanding
of Gann’s methods:

A copy of “Tunnel thru the Air”.

A good astrology program, like Solafire 5, to
generate various astrocharts and tables.

A price charting program, like Metastock, with
the ability to specify Gann Line and Gann Grid
parameters.

A good calculator and THE most important book of all:
1900-2000 and 2000-2050 ephemerides.

-----

So, first steps towards understanding TTTTA may be:

Learn the basics of astrology … forget about the
houses and their interpretations, you will not need
them, initially anyway. Just get focused on the
mechanical parts of the horoscope, like the angles,
aspects, signs, crosses, elements, modes, planets,
luminaries, nodes and the relationships, between the
360 degree dial and the zodiac.

Learn numerology and its links with astrology.

Read “Tunnel thru the Air”, at least once!~!

have a great day all

        yogi

NB: All information presented here is copyright©2004 to

        Stay tuned for some analysis of the cover
        and the Foreword in "Tunnel thru the Air."
                                                    INTRODUCTION




Before we open the book, let’s look at the cover:




         Dust Cover Graphics:
To get started, we must point out that the reprinted
versions of TTTTA in 1981 and 1990 did not have any
aeroplanes shown on the inside flaps.

Comments below refer to the original cover that shows
four planes in diving attitude on each inside flap
and eight planes on the front cover.

Much conjecture has been made about any coded
messages that may be contained in Gann's book,
 ......... "The Tunnel Thru the Air".

Even a study of the dust cover has some "Gannsters"
juiced-up and ready for the intrigue ahead.

Whoa back, now ... if there's ANY ideas to be
taken from the graphics on the dust cover, they
will likely to be fairly simple ... again, Gann
WANTED this stuff to be found !~!

Here's a few things, about the cover, to consider
... of course, there may be others too:

1. How many planes are there on the cover?

2. Number of planes and a mathematical
   relationship?

3. Positioning of the planes?

4. Geometric shapes.

5. Tunnel thru the air ...


--------------------------
                                                  INTRODUCTION




So, to expand on the first 5 of these:

1. In total, there is 16 planes in the original
   artwork of the dust cover.

  Four, in a downward spiral on each inside
  flap ... that is 8, so far.

  Eight more feature on the front cover, again,
  7 of these appear in a diving attitude and a
  SOLE bi-plane in a climbing posture,
  within "the tunnel".

  There would seem to be some conflict about
  the design of these aircraft, especially
  considering the origin of the plans ...
  ... a lot more about that, later.

  Eight divisions of a proven price
  range was a common ploy by Gann, just
  like the planes at different levels.

      ------------------------

2. On the front cover, there also seems to be a
   veiled reference to a Fibonacci sequence,
   with a certain number of the planes being
   flown in different zones to accentuate
   the sequence:

    1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8

 1 plane above the tunnel          = 1

 2 planes in the tunnel ...   1 + 2 = 3

 3 planes grouped together,
   just below the tunnel ... 2 + 3 = 5

 5 planes in total below
   the tunnel            ... 3 + 5 = 8

   1 - 3 - 5 - 8 = a Fibonacci sequence.

  So here we have a reference to the natural
  ratio of Phi = 1.618 and its reciprocal 0.618

              -------------------------
3. Positioning of the planes shows them all
   diving, except for the BI-PLANE, which is
   inside the uptrending tunnel.

  Here is a suggestion to trade with the trend,
  otherwise become a casualty in this war.

   Even then, a ratio of 1 winner to 15 losers
   was apparent to Gann.
-------------------------
                                                    INTRODUCTION




4. Along the lower edge of both the front and
   back covers three main geometric shapes have
   been highlighted in the city scene, they are:-

  a. Triangle - trine    - 120 degrees

  b. Square     - square -   90 degrees

  c. Sphere     - circle - 360 degrees

-------------------------

5. Finally, in this opening section, "the tunnel"
   itself, is shown to be uptrending. This looks
   to be the same as a typical trading channel,
   on any price chart.

  Such channels define a set trading range, that
  is repeated often, to the benefit of many
  astute traders.

  "Nothing new about that", you say.

  True, but the METHODS used to construct the
  tunnel or channel correctly, is one message
  that Gann has presented in TTTTA.


 In summary, we have already been introduced to
 some of the simple mathematics and geometry that
 Gann has hidden in his book.

 Now, the only other feature that remains on the
 dust jacket is the title of the book and that
 demands a focused effort of its own.

 Let’s move on now, to the first two pages of
text in TTTTA, the FOREWORD …..

              -----------------------
                                                          INTRODUCTION



The Tunnel Thru The Air - Foreword 09 May, 1927:

"... truth is stranger than fiction."

By the end of this book, you will see irrefutable evidence
of this observation.

Here, Gann suggests to read TTTTA three times and then read
the bible three times to gain infinite knowledge and wisdom.
Enough of both, to overcome even our greatest fear, Death
and our quest for eternal Truth.

Even in the TTTTA foreword, Gann exposes his love affair
with numbers and cycles, mentioning the 3 day cycle and
seven day cycle, twice ..... more about them later.

However, the HIDDEN information here, is a reference to
the importance of ANNIVERSARIES and other astrological
events, like eclipses.

In the Solafire 5 screenshot below we can see, that exactly
2 anniversaries after Gann wrote the foreword to TTTTA,
there was a total solar eclipse on 09 May, 1929.




Today's traders can quickly verify that such events, still

                                                INTRODUCTION

Not only does this example show us the importance of an
anniversary, it also gives us an example of a market,
that is sensitive to the seasons.
On the September equinox 2001, HDR made a significant low
at 38.5 cents, after a huge sell-off from 108, just after
the June 2001 solstice. More about the significance of
108 later.

ONE anniversary later, on the September equinox 2002, HDR
made a high at 92 cents ..... that price level has not
been seen since.
In fact, 6 months on, just 7 DAYS ahead of the March
equinox 2003, HDR made another significant low, at
39 cents ... within 1/2 cent of the September 2001 low !~!


In this HDR example, we can see how we can use a simple
tool, like anniversaries or seasonal trades to enhance
our trade entries and exits.
-----

Note, the low in mid-November 2002 was exactly half of
the high traded, just 60 days previously, at 92 cents
on the September equinox.

Later, we will look at the time and price cycles at work,
behind that low price target, at 46 cents.

                                                         INTRODUCTION



Now, let's look at the astrochart for 09 May 1927, as
there's some interesting aspects to be seen there. For
the astrologically-minded, we are using a 1 degree orb
in this chart:-




Astrochart No.1

Without going into any heavy-duty interpretations,
the principal features of this chart, to a trader,
may be:

Ascendant sextile to Jupiter.

Jupiter tredecile to both Mars and Pluto.

Neptune on 24 degrees Leo = 144 degrees on the 360 dial.

Moon is about to enter Virgo.

Moon conjunct Neptune and it is also about to enter Virgo.
Mars is conjunct Pluto, in Cancer.

Venus (ruler of monies) is within 1 day of being conjunct
the North Node ..... more about the nodes later.

Jupiter is also 150 degrees of Neptune.

Mercury tredecile both Moon and Neptune + quincunx Saturn.

-----
                                                          INTRODUCTION




Without doubt, the most prominent features of this chart
are the tredecile and biquintile aspects and these aspects
are very appropriate for the writing of TTTTA.

A tredicile = 108 degrees = 3/10 of 360 = 3 x 36 degrees.

Derived directly from the dimensions of the moon, this
aspect is one of the lesser known, yet one of the most
prominent in financial astrology.

Looking at the chart above, we can see Jupiter is making
2 tredecile aspects from its position at 25 degrees Pisces.

Since Mars and Pluto are conjunct, Jupiter is making two
tredeciles there.

Clearly, Jupiter and its association with the tredecile
is important to Gann's work, as are the THREE biquintile
aspects of 144 degrees on this astrochart.

-----

You will also remember that the high for HDR, in the
trading example above, was 108 = a tredecile aspect.

In some markets, price will find support and resistance
at the decile levels ... ie ... 36 degree divisions and
in the HDR example, it was 3 x 36 = 108 cents.

Since our tredecile aspect is derived from lunar links,
it is no surprise that this aspect will herald in some
key reversals in the market, especially where the Moon's
NODES are involved.


Closely linked to Gann's key 144 number, we will also
see the tredecile aspect feature in subsequent chapters.

For more detailed information on the numbers 108 and 144,
a visit to the following link will pay dividends:

http://ascension2000.com/Shift-of-the-Ages/shift13.htm

Communicator Mercury also shows up with a tredecile aspect
to Neptune, which shows us the veiled and hidden nature of
the astrological messages in TTTTA.

Already, we are seeing the importance of some basic maths
and geometry in TTTTA and it is only fair to warn readers
that this is the real crux of TTTTA and Gann's trading
methods.
                                                          INTRODUCTION



Some traders may find the dial easier to use that than
astrochart, in making the planetary connections. Here's
the dial for 09 May 1927:-




Astrodial No.1

We can see on the dial, that the ascendant
in our 9th May 1927 chart serves as mid-point
for no less than 7 planetary pairs … clearly,
that Ascendant degree will be a sensitive
point on this chart.

For those interested in a focused astrological
view of the associated astrocharts for TTTTA,
we need to draw on the skills of a highly
skilled astrologer, like Pia Barnett.

Obviously, an experienced astrologer will be
able to expand on interpretations and the
features of this astrochart, significantly.

Note: Quintiles series includes 144 degrees, the
     bi-quintiles, so prevalent in this chart,
     for 9th May, 1927 and throughout Gann’s
     work.

     Both tredecile and bi-quintile aspects are
     closely related, as they are both harmonics
     of 36/360 degrees.
                                                                      INTRODUCTION




Let's read Pia's interpretation of this
moment, shown in the Astrochart No.1, as Gann
writes the foreword to his “Tunnel” romance:-


9 May 1927 - 00:00am with Ascendant in the East.

Most dominant aspect is the quintile series indicating there would
be a lot of spiritual, occult, hidden energy available for the ones
who recognise the poignancy of these particular vibes.

Quintile tends to show the style used and or an obsession.

Mars is the initiator of this energy being the planet most heavily
aspected with the quintiles. Being in Cancer is interesting,
as Cancer is the birthing energy. (Birth of the book - TTTTA).
Mars is the henchman of the Sun and the Sun is generally quite
impotent without the force and drive of Mars.

Add to this the fact that Pluto is conjunct Mars who gives extra
force and the relentlessness necessary to drive an obsession.
The obsession perhaps being the need to keep the true contents
of the book secret until a time in the future when it could be
unravelled.

Cancer of course is naturally associated with memory and history
and has a tendency to keep things in abeyance, to be dug up
from the roots in time.

Mars is also semi-squaring Neptune so there would be a feel of
resigned frustration. Sun is semi squaring Uranus, so the feel
here is of the frustration of knowing (Uranus), the book would
not show its true light (Sun) until a future (Uranus) time.
Saturn is also strong in this chart not only to Mars which could
indicate a delay in the aspired dream of the book, plus the
conjunction to Pluto sending the book underground. Saturn
is also trined to Uranus/Jupiter indicating an ease with structuring
and forming the book, albeit clothed deceptively with the energy
of romance (Neptune).
Initiation and or others' money would be a theme coming from
the Uranus/Jupiter (future - insight - publishing - truth)
210 degree inconjunct to the Moon (memory - passive - holding)
and by association bringing in the Neptune energy creating the
need for mystique and illusion or deception or the need to hide
or mask the truth.

Moon/Neptune is always subliminal, karmic implications here of
veiling truths, not being able to ground - squaring the Sun, big
conflict around expressing clearly and openly. But driven anyway,
but in a concealing manner. The Sun/Moon/Neptune are in fixed
signs (heavy Karma), so the stubbornness and will to relieve a
measure of frustration would have been evident.
                                                                INTRODUCTION




Venus in Gemini indicating the need for expression and relating
information. Venus is the esoteric ruler of Gemini so it is dignified
and has a mission here. Venus is with the North Node hinting it is
of future benefit and the North Node still just in Cancer brings
back in the Cancer/Moon theme of delays/passivity and the need
to be found in the future. (Cancer/archaeology.)

Interestingly Mars (being dominant with quintiles) is parallel to the
North Node, so all the mysteries of the quintiles is linked into the
future and connecting it with Venus which mundanely brings it
back to the issue of money and how it is expressed through
romance. Venus squared with Uranus/Jupiter is indicative of the
challenge to express cunningly/cleverly (Gemini) in a manner
which can be shattered/ripped apart in the future (Uranus) and
republished (Jupiter). Watch for retrogrades.

--------

Clearly, astrologers like Pia, use much wider orbs
for interpretations, than we will use throughout
the course of this book.

To keep it simple for trading purposes, it
seems that Gann used quite tight orbs in his
charts ..... evidence of this will be shown,
in the main text of "Gann Signs".

By using tight orbs on the astrochart, we can
often transpose the same geometry of the aspects
in our astrocharts, directly to our price charts.

For example, a square (90*) on our astrochart
may be translated to our price chart, as 90 cents
or 90 dollars or even 90 minutes, hours, days on
the time axis on our charts.

Similarly, direct conversions may also be done
for all other astro aspects, as well.

To wrap up our analysis of the “Foreword” section
of TTTTA, we should look at the three points that
Gann outlined, he said:

“First, It is an interesting romance” - maybe, for
some, but to be honest, it’s quite tame and dry
compared to other romance novels.

-----
                                                       INTRODUCTION




“Second, It teaches a moral lesson and proves the
natural laws laid down in the Bible” - already,
we have seen references to cycles and important
anniversaries, as detailed above.

Such cycles were NOT invented by Gann, but they
came directly as a result of his perseverance,
in unravelling the astrological messages, in the
Bible codes.

Prominent examples of these cycles may be found
in the 1 - 10 - 100 - 1000 year cycles. These
may be found in plain view, in both the Bible
and other religious text, such as OAHSPE.

Many religious text were written, using similar
codes and as such, they all refer to the natural
cycles of the universe. Planetary TIME cycles
and their associated geometry play a huge part
in the natural laws, that Gann mentioned.

“Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be
 opened unto you,” says the Bible.

-----
Also, in the TTTTA foreword, Gann makes a veiled,
but specific reference to the works the English
astrologer Walter Gorn Old, better known by his
pen-name "Sepharial".


"Third, it shows the value of science, foreknowledge
and preparedness," to quote Gann.


"Science of Foreknowledge" is one of Sepharial's
works, that gives us an insight into determining
the relevant astrocycles, from the subject's
horoscope ..... the natal chart.


Before we even start on Chapter One, Gann has
pointed us towards astrology in directing us to
Sepharial's works, which are also evident on his
reading list.


Recognising Robert's real contacts and the role that
they served in his life, as it progressed, can be a
real challenge for some traders, in decoding TTTTA.
                                                          INTRODUCTION




To unravel the future, Gann quotes Solomon:

“Wisdom is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom
and with all thy getting, get understanding.”

This wisdom is hidden in the astrological messages,
contained in both the Bible and TTTTA and by using
astrology and other tools, we will “get understanding”
in the pages ahead.

--------------

So, if you do not like the prospect of employing the
simple maths, geometry and associated astrology, in
your trading analysis, then you will NOT enjoy the
rest of this ebook, either.


--------------




Finally, in the Foreword to TTTTA, Gann says:

"... you will be thankful to the power that guided
my hand, in showing you the way to eternal Truth."

Here he admits that the information contained in TTTTA,
is NOT his own work. Instead, he was simply the medium
used to transfer details, specifically related to the
markets into a readable format, albeit still in code.

Likewise, my efforts present NO revelations, that are
claimed to be exclusively my own. Instead, this ebook
series is the culmination of decoding Gann's work,
already presented by him, in TTTTA.

"Ghosts of Gann, it's Lucky Starr!~!" will be of interest
to Christians and traders alike, as we unravel the codes
that have held this information secure for thousands of
years.

Before you get too keen about astro time
cycles and Gann's work .....

1) If you do NOT like simple maths and geometry,
   then Gann's work (or mine) is not for you.

2) If you are looking for INSTANT trading answers
   and software, then Gann's methods (or mine) are
   NOT what you are seeking ... there was no
   computers or software, when Gann wrote TTTTA.

3) Studying these methods will open up a new
   realm of study that will last a LIFETIME,
   as these time cycles can be used to anticipate
   changes in all parts of our lives, not just
   the sharemarket.

  If you DO NOT have the DISCIPLINE to STUDY
  and APPLY these MANUAL methods, then please
  invest your money elsewhere.

........... some EASY and PRACTICAL astrotrading
tools, in over 770 pages of astrotrading knowledge,
just for you.

Limited edition: http://easy-trading-tools.00cd.com

Invest $585.oo in your easy trading tools
  and you will learn exactly what W.D.Gann
          did NOT tell you about TIME and PRICE !!

You will also learn about financial and business
     astrology from 12 practising traders
            and astrologers !~!

Three ebooks giving you a PRACTICAL introduction
to trading the markets, using the cosmic clock.

Having previewed the Gann Signs Introduction, there's more folks.

So, here's the second book in your astrotraders' package:

"Cardinal Astrographs ... easy trading tools" was
written as an introduction to some simple
astrotrading tools that you can use immediately.

It makes no claims to being the holy grail of
trading, but it does present a refreshing perspective
about using the cosmic clock for better market timing.

It has taken a lot longer than expected, to write it,
but it has been worth the wait!!


•       You will learn about some NEW trading tools
             to EASILY forecast TIME and PRICE !!


Over 190 pages of PRACTICAL and EASY trading tools,
including time and price projections, trading strategies
and an introduction to SIMPLE astrotrading ....
(only a basic knowledge of astrology required) and there's
NO EXPENSIVE software needed to put these methods into
practice.

If you DO NOT like simple mathematics and geometry, you
will hate Gann's work (and mine).


•       Learn how to identify TIME & PRICE targets !!


Add to that, help by FROOP, 21 price charts,
9 figures and 13 tables to help illustrate the
points made in the text ..... now we can start
to see, why it has taken so long for this little
gem to be unearthed.
My motivation for writing this ebook was to open
up discussion on many areas that have been previously
considered taboo .... like price and time projections
and their relationships to astrotrading strategies, as
one example.

To this end a discussion forum, for investors in this
book, has been setup to answer queries and promote
further exchanges of ideas on this trading frontier.


•       Easy trading tools to confirm your own
         technical analysis of ANY market .....


For chartists, this book introduces some simple methods
to help you realise the FULL potential of the TIME axis on
their charts. That means, getting more information out
of the charts to help make better market timing decisions.

Using PRICE as our primary indicator in technical analysis
gives us only HALF-OF-THE-STORY, since the indicators
derived from price alone are, by nature, lagging indicators.

Don't miss this opportunity to get your charts really
talking to you, revealing the whole story, by evaluating
both the TIME and the PRICE axis, with easy trading tools.

Add some advanced charting tools to include analysis of
the TIME AXIS and go "beyond Gann" to explore how you
can use the cosmic clock for better market timing.


•       How to use SIMPLE astrotrading tools
         to identify key trading days ...!!


For fundamentalists, some simple mathematical formulae
can be used to approximate price extremes and probable
key trading dates.

Often it is on these key dates, when markets breakout to
continue the old trend or make a trend reversal. These
key dates, will often coincide with company or commodity
news that is due to hit the marketplace, resulting in
a windfall for those informed in a timely manner.


•       Develop your trading skills, with some
         easy trading tools ......


.... easy trading tools that will provide you with some
ESSENTIAL and PRACTICAL trading techniques going forward.

Soon, these trading methods become second nature, just
like riding a bicycle ... once learned, never forgotten.
You can also be assured that most of what you will find,
in my "Cardinal Astrographs" ebook on market timing,
has NEVER been seen in print, before now.

•       Improve your WIN/LOSS ratio in your trading:

By using these easy trading tools, as part of your overall
trading plan, your market timing will improve and you will

SOME WARNINGS - up front:

Before you get too keen about astro time
cycles and Gann's work .....

1) If you do NOT like simple maths and geometry,
  then Gann's work (or mine) is not for you.

2) If you are looking for INSTANT trading answers
  and software, then Gann's methods (or mine) are
  NOT what you are seeking.

3) Studying these methods will open up a new
  realm of study that will last a LIFETIME,
  as these time cycles can be used to anticipate
  changes in all parts of our lives, not just
  the sharemarket.

 If you DO NOT have the DISCIPLINE to STUDY
 and APPLY these MANUAL methods, then please
 invest your money elsewhere.

4) No library readers = no refunds available.

If you are still VERY keen to learn about
astrotrading and the use of astrology, as a
superior market timing tool, in the commodities
and equities markets, then you have made the
right decision, go to:

happy trading
