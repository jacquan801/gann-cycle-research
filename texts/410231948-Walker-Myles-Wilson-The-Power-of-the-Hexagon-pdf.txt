Introduction to my Technical Tools.

i believe that the Hexagon is best used as part of an overall market concept or

philosophy. | |
No matter how good the target method is unless you can trade the signals ~

_ efficiently it will be of little use to you. That is why in this book and training video
lam covering a lot of the things that | personally use to trade.

These techniques give me a framework with which to view the markets.

- This framework can be applied to practically any market Decause they are all

_ created by traders perceptions,

_. The tools that | use are all based on traders. psychology rather than using

mathematical filters which distort the market reality.
_ I spent many years studying technical indicators such as stochastics. Macd,
various price band formulas plus many others. | reached the point where | could
view a price chart and estimate fairly accurately where the indicators were
_ positioned, Ultimately there was no real edge using standard indicators, at least

| forme.

_ The patterns that } present to you while not being t unique are strong and robust
tools.

_ The market building blocks are lime price and pattern. In this context | am refer-
ring to time as. the time frame that is most suifabie to chart not market cycles as
have already extensively written about them in my other books,

_ Every market has its ideal time frame: An ideal time frame is one where as

_ much irrelevant noise is filtered out giving good clean patterns but also the time
frame must allow for the smallest entry risk possible. |

Also | chart my markets on a 24-hour basis and primarily use 2 time frames for _

trading intra-day. The longer chart is 120 minutes and the shortest is 30 minutes.
Iwas using 10 minute charts for quite some time but they were too noisy and

gave too many false signals.

There is one situation where | will use a smaller time frame and that is when the

_ market is very volatile. in this case | have used charts as short as 2 minutes up

. to 10 minutes just depending on how good of the patterns appear on the smaller
time frames.
The patterns that | use to trade are,
- FAH Failure at highs.

FAL Failure at lows.

My. pattern 1 and 2.

Trend line breaks.

You will notice that 1 do not use any kind of indicators on my chart such as
a moving average or an oscillator. | prefer to see the natural patterns that
eccur in the market and foliow those, All the patterns that | am using are

| behavioural.

The Failure at highs occurs when there are no. new buyers around an old
high, other traders who are already long assess the situation and decide fo
take profits. and even go short.

With the Failure at lows the situation is reversed, the market makes a new
low and suddenly there are no new sellers.

_ My pattem 1 which is similar to a failure at lows is really just a break of
jong congestion area of support.

__ Prices break support there are no .new.seliers So a faily begins.

The situation in My pattern 2 the market runs into an area of resistance, it
_to forms an area of congestion. After a while the market breaks the resist-
- ance temporarily but there are no new buyers: and the market collapses

-. back down.

‘Trend line breaks have been around for a long time. Ultimately the market
can not go anywhere long-term without breaking some kind of trend line.

The Hexagon is the only indicator that | use and this gives us the price part

Of our equation,

What | primarily use it for is to take profits. |
‘One of the first books that | ever read on trading said that it was important
to get an idea of the risk reward of a trade before you entered that trade.

The writer suggested that for every dollar one risked you should be looking

_ -at atarget which made three dollars.

This is true and the Hexagon i la good way of getting a preliminary idea of |
our risk reward before taking a trade.

Now it is time to go into more detail on the tools that we have just
discussed so that you can get the full benefit from the Hexagon.

Trend line breaks

When | first started trading trend line breaks were my main too]. | have always
liked the logic behind them as many people look at trend lines and they become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. |

A trader has to use trend line is differently depending on the current phase of the
market. In the case of a rising market prices will often pull back to the trend line
and then accelerate off it. |

Visually they can tell us much about the market, if the market is rising quickly the
trend line becomes acute, when the market is going sideways the trend line will
frequently break and go nowhere.

At the start of a move, before everyone becomes convinced that the new move is a real trend
change, the initial trend line breaks are often not that good. This is because it takes awhile for the |
market momentum to gather.

As the trend progresses you can use trend line breaks on the sideways price areas and in the
direction of the trend, quife safely.

in the next phase where the market has been trending well expect that the first trend line break will
fail. This failure is often a very buy point

These comments about trend lines apply equally to both up and down markets.

Reading the market.

One of the hardest things to do is to define where you are in the market.
Should you be holding your trade for bigger profits or should you just get
out with what you have?

_ This is one of the fundamental and most important questions that must _
_be answered to become a successful trader. Certain market environ-
ments demand that you take quick and frequent profits while others are
completely the opposite. This contradiction can be the death of traders

__ because they invariably end up doing the wrong thing. Using hindsight

_ they see that they could hold on for big profits and decide to do this from

the next trade, the market immediately goes into.a dull chop. Afier being

frustrated for several weeks they switch just at the wrong time and vow to

only take quick profits

_ | have learnt this the hard way. before i had any market experience i used
to do this frequently but this is all part of the market education and if you

can survive and lear from your errors you will make it. |

The very first trade that ! did in the currencies, if | had never closed it out

but perpetually rolied it over | would never have been out of the money in

_ 20 years. | bought the Swiss franc (and sold the dollar in September 1985

on the day of the Plaza Accord. J took profits way too early on this position
_ simply because | did not have the market background to understand the

“perspective” of the trade.

“perspective” is my definition of the market environment. Try to imagine

that you are looking back from one or two years in the future and you're

looking ata weekly price chart in relation to the area a that you re currently

trading. |

These are the things i ask myself when thinking about tuming a low-risk
_ day trade into a position trade.
Is the market at an extreme high or low?

Has the market broken out of a range of three or more months?

As | answer yes to either of these questions | still have to examine the
market in the “perspective” of price action.

7 For instance if the market is at an extreme high or low butis trending
| strongly i still would not hold a counter trend position for very long. | would
have to see the market running out of momentum on the weekly charts |

before | would make a long-term hold, |
You can learn to incorporate market “perspective” into your trading
strategy.

Your trading strategy consists of these things.
1, Basic Day trade quick profits only.

2. Day trade entry that 1 is fumed into a longer term trade of several days to
several months.

a) Making additional day trade entries to your basic position trade.

by Signs that the trend is finishing or going into. congestion.

Strategy one is the easiest as you would pick an average number of points
that you could take from each trade just using the last.three months of
data. You do not have to understand market perspective but you do need
an excellent risk / reward ratio and you must be prepared to bear the frus-
tration of watching your small profitable trades 9° on to become really Dig
money.

_ Strategy two is more complex and open to error but can be more finan-
cially rewarding. That’s not to say that it is not with out its own frustrations.
watching a nice winning trade tumed into break even can be demoralising.

_ | personaily like to trade a combination of both and run systems in differ-
ent accounts but my one underlying philosophy behind any system I trade

is that 1 must be taking very low-risk trades. | feel has been my biggest

_ Strength in trading. Over the years that 1 was learning | saw many people

blow themselves out of the game by holding on to losing trades. 1 have
fiterally seen a millionaire go bankrupt. The incident that I'm thinking of

involved the Australian dollar

| had been trading for a couple of years when | met someone who had

_ made millions in property and now wanted to trade professionally full-

time. He invited myself and one other to share the expenses of his trading»
office. This was at a time when data feeds were very expensive unlike

today’s abundant data feeds and cheap rates.

_ He bought a couple of trading systems based on volatility break-outs and

he had his own trading guru. ~

| thought his guru sounded pretty good to so when he suggested buying

the Australian dollar at a certain price Jevel.| also coat tailed the trade. The

most valuable thing | had. leamed up to this point is that you must keep a

tight stop loss no matter how good the trade potential seems.
Expansion bars.

Expansion bars are important when you're using Hexagon price targets.
On the chart bar 1 has a range far greater than the average of the
previous bars and this makes it an expansion bar.

When there is an expansion bar you would wait for the market to stabilise
before using price targets.

Now we have another expansion bar 2.

A couple of things about this. It broke the second low and that meant that
the trend had changed to down so we would no longer looking to buy but
instead we are looking to sell rallies.

3. The market here had an expansion bar as well but this bar is not as
important as bar 2: because bar 2 occurred after quite a strong uptrend had
lost momentum and bar 3 occurred later in the down trend.

Expansion bars are critical things to watch when you are trading at price
target because you do not want to be standing in front of a train.

In reality you can tell when the market is getting volatile because you can
see the price action as it is unfolding. It is often around the time when
economic.numbers are released or after an important break out.

This is something that paper trading will never tell you but when you are
actually in the market you can see the price action hots up and you know
that there is the potential of an expansion bar. In this case stand aside for
a little longer until you feel the market is stable.
_ About a day later | was stopped out with ¢ a small loss and my trading
acquaintance held on,
Two or three weeks later the trading guru recommended another buy on the |
_ Australian dollar and once again | coat tailed the trade. |
Yet again | was stopped out with a small joss and my acquaintance kept both.
positions open,
This happened maybe another three or four times over the course of the next
few months and each time the result was the same.
My trading acquaintance never closed out any of the losing trades and was
“averaging up” The amounts got totally out of control as he continuously fronted —
up more margin. Near the end-as the market kept going down and he was
selling off bits and pieces he would weakly joke “well there goes the Porsche”
J personally had no worries even though I had taken the very same trades my
losses were quick and small.
| My acquaintance had a completely different experience and managed to wipe

— out his capital completely i kid you not Dut rorucally N he took his loss right on the
day of the low.

What | am trying to get across in this story is that risk control is the one thing
_ that will save you even if you are a lousy trader when you are starting out. Later
good risk control will also ensure that you are not working to get your losses |
back, instead you can be building your account.
_ Most people have the wrong attitude towards a losing trade. Their ego gets
locked into the trading rather than being in the flow. |
_ Let's take this situation, you have a retail shop that sells golf equipment and it is
the first of the month and you are paying your rent for the month. You write the
_ check and then feel depressed and angry. You keep thinking to yourself you're
the biggest loser and you should never be doing this. Doesn’t this sound ridicu-
lous? Of course it is: Anyone would think you are crazy if you were in business
and you didn’t expect to pay some expenses. Why is it that traders think it
_ should be any different trading?

As long ; as you are following your game plan you should be happy with the out-
— come. Think in terms of income and expenses, get away from this winning and
losing paradigm. It will make a tremendous difference to your trading psychol-
ogy, instead of beating yourself up over a.legitimate expense you don’teven —
have to waste your time thinking about it. Just move on to the next trade.
The Hexagon system combined with my technical tools is a very consistent and

low-risk method, there is absolutely no excuse for taking a big loss on any trade.

On the following pages | will add a few more simple observations that | hope will
clarify trading even more.

Up trend.

Looking at the chart below the market | isin an

What makes it so obvious is that each iow is s higher
than the jast one.

How we use this to define the trend is if the market
breaks the first low il’s a warning.

When the second low is broken the up trend is over
and we would now be looking to sell rallies rather
than buy dips.

Defining the trend.
Down trend.

Looking at the chart below the market ts in an
‘obvious down trend.

What makes it so obvious is that each high is lower
than the last one.

How we use this to define the trend is if the market
breaks the first high it’s a warning.

When the second high is broken the Down trend

is over and we would now be looking to sell rallies

if the second high is broken by just a few points
and then declines which some times happens, the
down trend is considered to still be in effect.

some more chart observations.

It is important to be able to read a price chart and | recommend spending
as much free time as. you.can studying old price charts. —

On Sunday night | will often spend 15 to 30 minutes reviewing the

intra day charts from the-previous-week and imagine myself trading them
again. This is just my way of tuning. into the market for the next day.
There are always going to be certain chart patterns that appear, work well
and then are not seen again for three or four months.

This is because the market is always changing its character. It oscillates
between different states of momentum and these create

different chart patterns. The same chart pattern has a different meaning
_ and outcome depending on the stage of the market where it is found.

Example the Australian dollar 60 minute chart.

We will start with the area marked B.
Notice how you could run.a trendline of the tops. The lows are dipping.
_ back like waves with fairly. deep dips when compared to the area marked
_ A. where again you could draw a trendline along the tops but the pullbacks
look like shallow waves not deepwaves.
When | see this pattern of waves as in B then | am very cautious about
using the failure at high signal as it has been my experience that when
the market Is making a new high while simultaneously creating this wave
shape the signals usually fail. |

| draw your attention to the area marked C. here, once again the market

_ IS making the wave pullbacks but you will notice that the highs are not as
strong and. the last-wave creates a double high. This shows a-slowing of
momentum compared with B therefore | would trade the area marked C if
a sell signal occurred. |

Next if we were to look ai the pattern in the area wave once again and
compare it with the 30 minute British pound chart.

You will see exactly the same pattern in the areas marked A. and B.

The difference ts that these two patterns are forming under an old high
and are showing a loss of momentum where as the area marked B on the
Australian dollar chart was created making new highs and was therefore
showing signs of strength. |

So as | pointed out, same pattern but a different phase of the market has a
different outcome,

_ The markets are basically trading 24 hours a day but as a general rule the
_ most active times are from the London open until the New ‘York close.

Do you chart the 24-hour market?

Yes | do, the best charts are 30 minutes up to 120 minutes.

What exactly is the trading system?
-. You use either the entry patterns or trend line breaks as $ explained earlier
— to get your entry into the market.

_ You then use the Hexagon.
1) Profit takes are based on multiples of 360°.
_ 2) Re-entry with the trend is based on 180° Hexagon price targets. |
3) When the market is slow and trading quietly you will trade between —
180° targets rather than having a 360° target.

Can | trade using just price targets or do | need to use the technical tools —
aswell?

if the market is trading quietly with out much volatility you can trade from —
' price target to price target but when there is a strong trend trading against |
_ the trend will not be profitable. In this case you can take proms at price

| targets and buy. on retracements successiully. ?

Can | trade to system by leaving orders in the market or do { have fo.
watch it all the time? | |
As the minimum size bar is 30 minutes you don't have too constantly
‘monitor the market. You can leave orders to take profits or to enter at the
retracement level. These levels are not hit every five minutes so you can
walk away and do something else and then when it is in the target zone
watch the market more closely to see if there are any expansion bars etc.
The same applies to getting into the trade initially but sometimes you do
_ have to watch more closely because the market may be close to giving
. a signal but is quiet. In this case if you have other things that need to be
done, choase an entry and stop loss level and leave an order in the mar-
_ ket. | |

On the demonstration charts there are usually two entry levels marked
what does this mean? |

The first level is the close of the price bar. This is the most risky entry but
can give you a good price sometimes.

The second level is a break of the bars range. This is much Safer as its
screens many whip-saws but sometimes the stop has to be bigger.

i would recommend the second method with the larger stop especially if
you can't watch the market ail the time.

If you find that you are still getting whipped go to a maner lime frame such
as 120 minutes.

We are do | place my stops after | make an entry?

_ if the bar is very large compared to the average bar place a stop at the
50% level of the signal bar.

Otherwise place a stop at the other side of the bar from your entry point.

When using their Hexagon numbers do you put your order in exactly on
the number?

It is better to give the market bit of leeway. If you are trying to take a profit
put the order in a little before the number to make sure you get a fill and
likewise when trying to trade at the retracement number.

What do | do if the market doesn’t make it fo my profit take number?
There are two alternates here. One is that it stalls out and starts going

_ sideways a few points before the number, in this situation just close out

at market. |
The other thing that can happen is that it heads in the direction of the
number but never makes it and quickly tums around.

if there are any of our usual signals that we would normally use to enter a
new position take what profit you have and turn it around.

Failing that put a stop in to cover your brokage and any slipage but do not
let if turn into a loss.
The Hexagon Method.

W. D. Gann developed and wrote about more trading systems than any
other trader / author that | can think of. |
Vhen you consider his work, most of it was developing new ways of
trading at price or time.

His price target methods are still innovative. 1 don’t think many people
realise how many methods W. D. Gann further developed or pioneered.
His Gann angies were not original but an extension of other traders earlier
ideas but he expanded and laid them out in a methodical fashion. .
People have designed and used systems based around only Gann angles
successfully, in fact my first knowledge of Gann came from an article
written about using Gann angles.

The article presented a simple system of trading using 45° and 2/° angles.
Unfortunately the large stop losses didn’t suit my personality and | was
never able to trade it but it was a viable and robust system.

Nevertheless it piqued my interest in all things Gann.

it was around the same time that | first saw ihe Square of nine y and
Hexagon charts.

'W. D. Gann called these charts master calculators which was sometimes
confusing as he also called his geometric angle chart overlays such as the
square of 144 master calculators also. He used this term interchangeably
so you would have to know the context of what he was talking about to
understand whether it was a geometric or numerological caiculator.

_ The Hexagon is a numerological calculator. |

W. D. Gann was the only person that 1 know of to ever develope this form
of calculator for use in trading.

Unfortunately he left no details on how to use these caiculators so it has
been up to people such as myself to unlock their codes. |

Many books have been written on the square of nine but this is the first
comprehensive book about the Hexagon. |

lam only speculating here but | believe the Gann was not the first trader to
use square roots. His square of nine is basically a square root

calculator so it would be a handy little tool to quickly work out the square
roots of numbers. As | understand it the square of nine was developed in
the far east many centuries earlier possibly as part of the “magic Squares’
that were always very popular mathematical structures.

| think that after Gann worked with the square of nine and possibly other
“magic squares” he experimented with many other shapes. |
One of these being the Hexagon as Hexagon numbers are triangular
numbers, |
W. D. Gann also had the square of 4 also known as Even Squares chart.

_ There was the conic chart that he was using on Coffee in 1936. The circle
chart other wise known as the wheel of 24,
As weil as the basic calculator they would ail be altered in some way to
improve their scaling for instance Gann had a double sided Hexagon with
dual numbers in each square. Box 1 would also contain the number 15. 2
would also contain 30. 3 would aiso contain 45. | am not sure and have no
way of knowing whether these calculators that he left were all used actively
for trading or if some of them were still in the experimental stage.

The Hexagon is used for finding support and resistance in the markets.
On the Hexagon the 360° numbers are very important or multiples of 360°
as well as the 180° numbers.

if you wanted to know the 360° level of any number this is the formula.
Take the base number, say 414 then you get the square root of this which
is 20,34. Add to this 1.75 So 20.34 plus 1.75 equals 22.09.

Next muitiply the result by itself, 22.09 times 22.09 equals 488. You can
see that one level up |

on the Hexagon from 414 is 488-487 so thats the 360° level on Hexagon.

For the 180° number take the base number say 414 and get the square
root, 20.34,

Add 0.875 to the square root 20.34.

(plus 0.875 equals 21.21)

Next you multiply this by itself. (21.21 by 21.21 equals 449.8)

Rounded to the next whole number is 450. If you look at your Hexagon
you'll see that 450 is exactly opposite 414 so this means that 414 is 180°
from 450. |
The Hexagon method that 1 have developed is a total market approach,
The philosophy behind the method is that all entries must be of a very
low-risk with a potential high reward, The trades must be controlled and
— executed in a disciplined manner. 7
Over all the system is structured so that it is simple to follow and all users
can trade it consistently. As you have been reading the text and following
the training videos you have probably become aware that we are using the
same tools over and over again in very much the same way.

We're not trying to get every single move from the market but we are
making very profitable trades over all. 7

| personally think that one of the biggest errors that traders make | iS
switching systems too early, learning too many contradictory methods and
trying to capture every move.

Your essential task is to learn the technical tools including the Hexagon
method and trade them consistently.

This is your true path fo making money in the markets. |
Good trading becomes aimost like a factory job, it is just a matter of —
turning up, being organised and taking the trades.

So in summary the first part of our method comprises the entry techniques.
Failure at lows. |

Failure at highs.

My pattem 1.

My pattern 2.

Trendiine breaks.

The second component of our method is the Hexagon.
The Hexagon Is used in two ways.

To take profits.

To re-enter after a profit take.

The Hexagon method for profit takes.

in this initial explanation of taking profits using the Hexagon jam ignoring —
the concept of scaling for individual markets, this will be covered later.

Looking at the Hexagon. it is comprised of 6 sides that that are then spilt
into two making 12 segments. |

A circle is then Grawn around the Hexagon and the 12 segments 2 are split
into 30° units.

The inner ring of the Hexagon has the numbers 1 through 6.

Number six falls on the 0° line.

‘When looking at the next ring the number 18 falls on the 0° line. __

On the Hexagon the zero line is also marked as the 360° line so we can
say that number 18 is 360° from number 6.

_ How we use this information is to look up the start number of any move,
for instance 6 and take profit at the 360° number, 18.
To clarify further the 360° points. Take the number 7 the next rung on the
Hexagon 360° falls in between 19 and 20.

Number 8 and the 360° line is 21.

Another example, 133.

The 360° level is 120.

293 the 360° number is 356.

How we use this would be, the market made a low at 193 and we bought
so we take profits at 244,
Or the market made a high at 193 and we sold so we take profits at 148.

initial Scaling.

The currencies. —

Euro at 1.2500.

Take away 1.2 equals 500.

500 on the Hexagon is your base number.
1.2650.

Jake-away 1.2 equals 650.

The British pound at 1.8500.

Take away. 1.8 equals 500.

900 on the Hexagon is your base number.
Take away 1.8 equals 650.

Now if you were trading the Euro and it had made a low at 1.2500 you
would look on your Hexagon at 500 and see that 360° from 500 is 581
which would be your profit take target.

You would do exactly the same with the British pound.

If the low was 1.8500 you would use 500 on the Hexagon giving you a
360° target of 581.
The 180° Numbers.

The 360° profit take numbers are easy enough to find because they can |.
_ only be in one position but the 180°-Numbers have more potential
variations so we must structure the possibilities so as not to leave too
many alternates. :

The Guidlines for 180°. Numbers.

On Ganns Hexagon the numbers get higher in an anti-clockwise direction
so this is the direction you use in most cases. If the hexagon you are using
has numbers going higher in.a clockwise motion this would be the

_ direction you'd mainly use.

Price targets can not go back and forth. Once a price target is hit you can
Net go across the chart 180° and get the original start number.

Therefore to get a fresh target count forward 8. (The 1908-A method)

if counting forward gives ioo similar a larger count back 8. (The 1908-B |

_ method)

The target can not be too close compared with the average. range of the

— market,

Example the average retracement in your market has been 100 poinis but

_ . your 180° target is 29 points, This would not be a valid target.

if the base number falls exactly on any 30° segment go directly across on
the same fine (180°)

Example 728 on the. 30° line go to 776 on the. 210° line.
Exampie 481 on the 60° line go to 520 on the 240° line.

scaling

The reason that you scale the Hexagon numbers | is to get the best fit for

each market.

The following examples wil make this clearer and here are the factors that

you should consider when scaling.

What you are trying to do is get a reasonable number of price targets that —

are accurate but you do not want too many price targets and you don't

want price targets that are too infrequent.

| only use the Hexagon numbers from 1 to 1000.

\ don’t use the numbers from 1 to 50 on markets such as the currencies

but | do use it on lower-priced markets such as stocks and some grains.

If 1am treating the currencies and the number is 990 i will play with this
number and move it up to the next circle past 1000. d make it 90 then 1

_will work my targets off that number.

If the currency had passed a number such as 1.2000 | would go 1 2100

dropping 1.2 then | would use 100.

. You will see examples of this in the training videos that will make this |
explanation clearer.

. As the market becomes more or jess volatile you may have to change your

scaling or your profit take factor.

| In very quiet markets sometimes the best you can do for profit takes are —

the 180° targets because the 360° targets fall well beyond the current

market ranges

The next two charts that we are going to study are com and soybeans,

First of all these give us two types of scaling to compare and also intro-
duce the four count rather than the eight count |

Corn prices are between $200 and $300. _

_ in this case we drop the big figure and just use two numbers,

_ Example 256 becomes 56.

_ Soybeans and prices are around $600.

In this case we use all three numbers.

The 4 count is a variation on the 1908 method but is only used when using

the inner wheel of the hexagon. Numbers 1 to 100 fall in the inner wheel of
the hexagon |

The 4 count you just count forward 4 places instead of the usual 8.
_ ‘This will be self explainary in the com example that follows.

Corn high $250. To find the retracement target use 50 on the Hexagon.
Opposite 50 on the Hexagon is 34 but as corn had already taken out 2
previous lows as it was nearing 34 we were looking for more than just a
retracement target and used the 360° target on the Hexagon.

50 on the Hexagon is side-by-side 29. That is 29 is the 360° target from

50. The actual low was to 27.6.
_ To find the next target round this number up to 28.

28 gives a 360° target of 49 this is only one cent lower than 50 which was
our Jast starting point therefore we need to generate another target. away

from 50. To do this we count forward 4 places instead of the usual 8. The
reason for this is that when we are using the inner ring of the Hexagon i.e.
Numbers 1 up to 100 counting forward eight moves us.too far around the

Hexagon to be useful but 4 works quite well.

This time we will use the 4 count 28, 29, 30, 31, 180° from 31 is 03.

The high was 55.
From 55 looking for a retracement target.

180° from 55 is a target of 41. The low was 40. |
40 lands right on one of the 30° divisions of the Hexagon in this.case 60°.

So 180° on the same line gives a target of 52. The actual high was 51.
The 180° target from 51 is 33 but the 360° target is also very close at 30

80 we need to find a fresh target that has not been generated before.

If we count forward 4 and go across 180° we end up one cent from our old
target of 41-42. So we must use a variation of the 1908-B method but this

time because we are using the | inner ring of the Hexagon we only use the 4
count and not 8. |

51 50 49 48 going across 180° from 48 gives 36.

The actual low was 35,

From the low at 35 you'll get a 360° target and that is 59.
The next high was 63 and the error of only 4 cents.

In the previous com example we dropped the bigger number which

was the 2 and used the inner wheel of the Hexagon. Thereason for —

this was that the large number, in this case 2, changes

infrequently where as in the soybean example there is far more
volatility and.the ranges are normaly bigger so we must use all of the
numbers that are in the price,

When generating target numbers you must also consider the
average range to make sure that your price target is within the range

of normal current market mavement.

The 180° target from the high of 628 is 590 the actual low was 592.
We cannot use the same target that we have just come from which
was 628. To generate a fresh target count forward eight from the low
and that gives you the target of 619 at 180° and the high was 618.

618 lies in the area of the Hexagon where you would use.the 1908 A

method. This gives a target of 551 which looks to be too big for the
current range of the market. Therefore we will get an alternate target
number. To do this the best available was the 1908-B method count-

ing back from 618 and going across 480° this gave 565 that was not
reached,

- ‘There was a low at 584 and a rally back to 601. | |
_ The 180° target and the 360° target both for on the same line of the

_ Hexagon so we need an alternate target therefore we use the

Much of this chart demonstrates how to adjust the
scaling when the Hexagon is around |

900, 1000 because we only use Hexagon numbers
between 71-1000.

A) scaling price is high is 1.2058. We are using
the last three numbers 058 is the inner ring of the
Hexagon therefore increase the start number to

458.

158 lies on the area of the Hexagon we you use —
the 1908 method this gives a target of 92.
Price low 1.1992 So this is 92.

B) Scaling. Price 992 needs to come up over the
thousand 992 becomes 92.

GC) Expansion bar.

D) Price pullback to 7 2058. Scaling 055 becomes
155, 360° target from 155 is 202, deducting 100
we just added gives 102 target. 7

E) High 705 (71.2105)

Chart 1.

1) price high 212 gives a 360° target of 164. —

2) price low 163 one point from target and also a
Failure at lows pattern, FAL

3) price low 171.

4) market on holiday and then makes an expansion —
bar. Using the price low of 171 increase the profit
take because of the expansion bar. 2x360° gives a

target of 273. The high before the next congestion
period was 272.

Hexagon Questions and Answers.
What do | do if my profit take ts hit and the market just keeps going?
There are several ways of looking at the situation. The primary one is that

you have made a profit on your trade which would have been a good risk
/ reward so over the long term if you continue doing this you will be a very

successful trader.

The system is not designed to gei every move in the markel, it is Gesigned
to gel safe moves.

if the market keeps going after you take your profit you can always
re-enter on the next valid signal even if it is at a completely different price
because you should have a lower risk entry setup when you have a valid
signal.

_ What are some of the things i should look for when selecting price targets?

Price targets should not repeat several times in a row.

When a 180° and a 360° target are both found on the same line of the
Hexagon you would need to find a fresh target.

if the price target is a long way away from the current market when
considering the current market volatility look for a closer target.

in certain market conditions are 360° target is too small but doubling it is
too big in that case use the 360° target and then add to that another 180°.
When the market has very low voiatility you will probably need to use the
180° targets as a profit target instead of the 360° targets.

The market | am trading never seems to get price targets what should |
do?

The market and trading hits price targets too often what should | do?

This is obviously a question of the correct scaling. You do have to
experiment yourself on markets that | haven't covered here. You want to
find a balance between price targets being hit too often or not being hit fre-
quently enough. As you have probably seen from the text and the videos

_ that | do play around with the numbers to get a good fit and sometimes

i have to adjust these numbers because the market has become more
volatile or has fallen into a range. i don’t consider this a flaw as it is quite
obvious when you are trading a market that the market is either very active
or becoming dull.
Once you do have the correct scaling you always caiculate the price

_ targets in the same way. The only difference is if you are using the

_ inner part of the Hexagon where the numbers move. around one circle |
. quite quickly and then the only modification is, that you count 4 Places n not 7
8 when using the 1908 method, |

When do | use the 1 908-A method?

if a base number is found on the Hexagon between 270° and 330°

When do | use the 1908-B method? | :

if a base number is found between 270° and 330° as mentioned in the

—1908-A method answer but by using those price targets you would be
repealing the last target. You would then use the 1908-8 method.

You wrote earlier in the text about the Hexagon how to calculate the 360°

in the 180° numbers using a formula. |

Why don't you just use a 180° formula instead of using the physical

Hexagon?

_ When I refer to 180° targets they are in reality an approximation. The

_ -Hexagon by nature of its shape is a dynamic calculator and its true

| advantage | ies in the extra harmonics that it calculates. So ! am just using
._ the expression 180° targets as a generic form that really encompasses the
various methods for finding retracement targets.

On a price chart where do you start your count (base number) from?
From the last low or high where the market made its move from not the

. . . extreme high or low.

. Does this work on all markets?

i don't Deiteve that an unmodified Hexagon works on all markets. This is
' why. W. D. Gann modified his calculators by using several numbers within
the one square. For exampie the first square with number 1 would also.

_ contain the number 10 or 30 depending on the market. The next square
with the number 2 would aiso have the number 20 or 60 and so would
continue on up in this fashion.

J don’t think that markets with very small Ranges in real terms such as
penny stocks can be calculated without modifying the Hexagon and the
same applies to very high priced markets such as s the Dow when it is
above 10, 000, |

i have been trading the system successfully but now the Prom ta takes don't
seem to work what should | do?

in this case switch to another market that is working weil and.experiment
on the scaling. it is possible that the market is changing its price ranges
_ and the previous scaling that you have been using needs to be modified.

_ When | talk about modifying in this case | don’t mean constructing a new

Hexagon with double numbers, What | would suggest you do is go back to
the examples in the text and the video and try changing the numbers.
Example the market is at 256 try using 56, 560 or 256 as your base ©
number. If you still can’t get a satisfactory result keep monitoring the _
Market because it will get back into its normal rhythm eventually and you
can resume trading it |

_ When don’t you use price targets for profil lakes? _

When there is an expansion bar there is always the potential for a larger
profit so | will monitor the price action and try to trail my profit take.
There are certain markets that when they make a major breakout are
virtually one way markets for some time. 1am thinking especially about
the grains such as soybeans and aiso the Currencies. In these cases it is
better to switch into a daily mode and try and maximise the trade.

Using the Hexagon on Daily charts.

The sequence of the hexagon is the same as intraday but scaling usually
needs to be adjusted up.

There are two important points of difference between Daily and Intraday.

1) Hf you need to, on markets with prices over 1000 use the > complete
Hexagon not just numbers from 1-1000.

2) instead of caiculating the target from the last area the price accelerated
from, use the first pullback after the high or low, —

The following charts should make this very clear. —

Hexagon Sequences

Once the correct scaling has been settled on use the Hexagon in the same
way.

The numbers will generally move in alow to high direction untess it will break
one of the guidliness. If it does break the guidlines use the alternate sequence.

Price targets can not go: back and forth. Once a - price target is hit you can not
go across the chart 180° and get the original start number. -

Therefore to get.a fresh target count forward 8. (The 1908-A method)

If counting forward gives too similar a targer count back 8. (The 1908-B meth-
od) — |

The target can not be too close compared with the average range of the
market.

Example the average retracement in your market has been 100 points but your
180° target is 20 points. This would not be a valid target.

If the base number falls exactly on any 30° segment go directly ai across on the
same line (180°)

The 4 count ts a variation on the 1908 method but is only used when using the
inner wheel of the hexagon. Numbers 1 to 100 fall in the inner wheel of the

hexagon. With the 4 count you just count forward -4 places instead of the usual
8. |

Key to illustrations.
