If you have been trading stocks, options or futures for any length of time you are probably familiar
with W.D. Gann, at least by name. Gann was a prodigious researcher and a prolific author for
most of the first half of the 20th century. He traveled to Egypt to experience first hand the
proportional beauty of the Great Pyramid, and to India to experience first hand another source of
ancient knowledge and wisdom. Many contemporary Gann researchers believe that the Square
of Nine was first used in India hundreds and perhaps even thousands of years ago and that Gann
rediscovered it there. So remarkable was Gann's reputation that people paid the price of a single
family home to attend Gann's weekend trading seminars. His work has spawned hundreds of
articles, books and computer programs attempting to decipher his often cryptic writing style or
claiming to have discovered his "secret" for trading the markets.

If Gann had a secret, we don't know it. But secrets or no, Gann is credited with verbalizing an
abstraction that captures the imagination of every person with the dream of making it big in the
markets - "when price and time square change is inevitable." Even without having a clue what
squaring of price and time could mean the idea that any method of market analysis could be used
in the same sentence with the word inevitable will get your attention every time.

The momentum that started this tract came via a telephone call from a friend who trades stock
futures. He related a call that he had received from another futures trader with whom he
exchanged trading ideas and outlooks by email. The caller told the trader to get an historical
chart, but not tell him what ticker the chart represented, or the trading period the chart
represented. "Give me a price for an obvious swing high or low", the caller said. "Just to save
time, tell me if it's a high or a low, and if the next swing off that pivot is major or minor." Who
wouldn't be curious enough to participate in this? Over the next several minutes the trader gave
the caller several instances of the minimal information he had asked for and after a brief period
each time received back from the caller two or three price levels one or more of which the caller
said would be major support or resistance or change the trend. The results were not perfect but
they were darn close enough to what was actually happening with that ticker to instigate many
hours of follow up, research, and experimentation, and finally, an understanding of what price
squaring time means, and how to do it simply in any market without paying hundreds or even
thousands of dollars for new software, special equipment, or Gann size seminar fees.

Gann wrote in metaphors. He described complex things with symbols instead of plain language.
He often provided so much data that there was little information to be found. Much of what has
been written about Gann and his methods adopts this cryptic style. The writers taunt you with "I
know something you don't" and more often than not do not tell you what it is despite the price of
the work or what the title of their book may claim. We have tried very hard to avoid that.

This is a book about technique. How to do things. We do not attempt to hide any "truths" in
symbolic language. Within the first few chapters you will know how the caller was able to impress
the trader with his prescience. You will be able to reliably duplicate the caller's results in any time
frame with any ticker. You will learn how to print a plain-jane daily or intraday chart from a
charting program or the internet and quickly turn it into a Square of Nine roadmap that will define
the boundaries of the current trend and show you the exact price levels of the most likely major
resistance and support. You will learn how to forecast exactly where and when the current trend
could come to an end. You will have the knowledge to make the Square of Nine your own and to
apply it with the simple tools you already have on hand.

                                     THE GANN WHEEL



When presented with the idea of the Square of Nine, this illustration is most likely what you think
of. A useable version is available at http://www.tradingfives.com/addenda.html.




As with most things associated with Gann, they are described in colorful terms and made to look
more difficult than they really are. The Gann Wheel or Square of Nine chart has been compared
to or described as the floor plan of the Great Pyramid. Gann is said to have kept a scale model of
the Great Pyramid with the peak labeled with the numeral one and each block consecutively
numbered in a counterclockwise fashion. You can easily imagine how this pyramid would be
constructed, by grabbing the number one on the Gann Wheel and pulling it straight up to create a
three dimensional object from the two-dimensional flat surface of the paper. This is probably a
fairly useful thought experiment because it creates a clear picture in the mind of opposing sides,
distinct angles, and the increasing distance between numbers, what we relate to as volatility, as
you move further away from the numeral one on the top of the pyramid.

That the Great Pyramid of Gizeh also features prominently in the work of R.N. Elliott and the
adherence of Fibonacci ratios to something built thousands of years ago is probably more than
coincidental. For example, the Great Pyramid is 5,813 inches high (5-8-13) and the inch was the
standard unit of measure in ancient Egypt. The ratio of the elevation to the base is .618. The total
of the four edges of the base, measured in inches, is 36,524.22 which is exactly 100 times the
length of the solar year. What does it all mean, who knows? In a totally unscientific affirmation it
does suggest that the human brain may be hard-wired to respond in a certain way to very specific
mathematical ratios and spatial relationships.

The Real Square of Nine?

Gann gave many courses on different aspects of his method but he never gave a course
exclusively on the Square of Nine. We understand from others who have studied much of Gann's
original work that in one of his courses he did write about what he called a square of nine that
looked something like this:




                                                                                                  5
                                  9      18     27      …..    81
                                  8      17     26      …..    80
                                  7      16     25      …..    79
                                  6      15     24      …..    78
                                  5      14     23      …..    77
                                  4      13     22      …..    76
                                  3      12     21      …..    75
                                  2      11     20      …..    74
                                  1      10     19      …..    73

And although he never referred to it by any particular name Gann also produced his own
illustration of the Gann Wheel, what we call today the Square of Nine that is the same as the
illustration on the website. We know that Gann used what we call the Gann Wheel to trade along
with the complete version of the above table of 81 numbers as well as several other tables of
numbers and geometric charts. Today we take for granted things like hand-held computers and
wireless communications. In Gann's day you had to be a lot more creative and resourceful.

Use the Gann Wheel then Put It Away

Although we will cover in this section a classic and simple use of the Gann Wheel to forecast
price support and resistance levels, at the end of this section we will put the paper copy of the
Gann Wheel away. The purpose of this short exercise is to provide a conceptual framework to the
mathematical applications of the Square of Nine that is the heart of this work and much of Gann's
work as well. Later on it will be much easier to make sense of an expression like "19 is on the 90
degree angle" after you've seen how that works in two dimensions on the Gann Wheel.

                             31    32     33     34    35     36     37
                             30    13     14     15    16     17     38
                             29    12     3      4     5      18     39
                             28    11     2      1     6      19     40
                             27    10     9      8     7      20     41
                             26    25     24     23    22     21     42
                             49    48     47     46    45     44     43

If you draw or imagine a circle around the outer edge of the above table we can conceptualize the
table as a rectangle inside a circle with a 360 degree circumference. The vertical line from 34 to
46 is at 0-180 degrees, and the left to right horizontal line from 28 to 40 on the table is at 270-90
degrees. In the example above we can say that 19 is 90 degrees up from 15. The numeral 23 is
180 degrees up from 15 and 90 degrees up from 19. The numeral 8 would be 180 degrees down
from 15. The "up" and "down" references mean greater or lesser numbers and not relative
positions on the table. For example, 8 is 180 degrees down from 15 and 23 is 180 degrees up
from 15 even though 8 and 23 are both on opposite sides of the horizontal 270-90 degree line.

In this very simple example we are using the Gann Wheel as a square root calculator. That may
not be obvious to you at this point but when we start to do the math it will be. The number 15 lies
conveniently on the 0-180 degree angle so it's easy enough to show a 90 degree or 180 degree
rotation. What if the number is not one of those on the most convenient fixed angles, say 37 on
our small chart, which lies in the upper right hand corner? Most commercial Gann Wheels come
with an acetate overlay with several angles printed on it. To calculate targets from 37 you would
move the overlay to the right so that the zero or 360 degree angle lay on 37 and then read the
angles of interest directly from the repositioned overlay.

We neither encourage nor discourage using a two-dimensional (paper) version of this square root
calculator. After all people have been successfully using this tool for long before there was a Wall



                                                                                                   6
Street in New York or even a New World to put a New York in. Just be prepared for a steep
learning curve. The paper version increments in whole numbers and can be difficult to apply to
stock prices less than $150 and to many futures prices which may require a radical conversion of
one kind or another. Of course, the folks that know these conversion factors aren't going to tell
you about them without serious cash changing hands, if at all. That being said, any number of
books, courses and seminars on applying the paper version of the Gann Wheel or the Square of
Nine are available on-line or in person, and some have been available for many years. We
haven't traveled this road because we believe that there is an easier way.




                                                                                               7
                              THE SQUARE ROOT THEORY


We have alluded to the Square Of Nine as a square root calculator. We have attributed not the
discovery of this tool (the actual discovery or date of first use is an unsolved mystery) but its
public application to trading stocks and commodities to W.D. Gann. Perhaps it's worthwhile to
know that Gann was not the only financial writer to publicize the seemingly magic power of
squares and square roots in forecasting stock prices. In the early 1950s William Dunnigan
developed two stock trading systems called the Thrust Method and the One Way Formula. Both
methods had several advantageous entry techniques but each had an absence of exit
techniques. Dunnigan was above all a portfolio manager and not happy with the risk-reward
aspects of his own trading methods, Dunnigan supported and publicized the Square Root Theory.
He went so far as to call this theory the "golden key" and claimed recognition from some
economics and statistical trade journals of the era.

References to the Square Root Theory as a predictor of stock prices pops up every now and then
in financial writings. Norman Fosback used the theory in a 1976 publication called Stock Market
Logic to make the case that the normal trading range of low price stocks provides greater profit
opportunities than the normal trading range of high price stocks. In 1983, a book entitled The
Templeton Touch, by William Proctor, disclosed that one of Templeton's 22 principles for stock
market investing was that stock price fluctuations are proportional to the square root of the price.
Square roots will always maintain a cozy mainstream relationship with stock prices if only
because they are an essential component of almost every volatility or option pricing formula.

The theory holds that stock prices move over the long and short term in a square root
relationship. For example, IBM made a monthly closing low of 4.52 in June, 1962 and monthly
closing high of 125.69 in July, 1999. This is within a few percentage points of the square of the
sum of the square root of the low price + 9 or (2.12+9)^2. GM made a low of 15 in November,
1974 and a high of 95 in May, 1999. Again, a few percentage points from the square of the sum
of the square root of the low + 6 or (3.87+6)^2.

There are hundreds and hundreds of these examples across the stock, financial and commodity
markets. Even a few minutes with a pile of stock charts and a calculator will build confidence that
major highs and lows are related to each other by additions and subtractions to their square
roots. The Square of Nine takes these square root relationships to a different level as you will
learn in the pages ahead.

"We use the square of odd and even numbers to get not only the proof of market movements, but
the cause." W. D. Gann, "The Basis of My Forecasting Method" (the Geometrical Angles course),
p. 1




                                                                                                   8
                      THE SQUARE OF NINE ROADMAP CHART



The first practical application of the Square of Nine will make use of the degrees of the circle
concept we developed with the Gann Wheel, a calculator, a pencil and an expanded Square Root
Theory. We are expanding the Square Root Theory by adding divisions of whole numbers, and
not just whole numbers, to the mix, and by moving beyond only price calculations to include a
simple time element on the charts we will construct shortly.

Circles Within the Wheel

In the Gann Wheel section we said things like "19 is 90 degrees up from 15." An expression like
that makes sense only if we visualize a rectangular table of numbers enclosed in a circle of 360
degrees. It's imperative to embrace the terminology because expressions like degrees and
angles from here to there, or such and such price squaring with time on the 108 degree line are
the lingua franca of the Square of Nine and essential to understanding how the different pieces fit
together.

                            31     32     33    34     35     36    37
                            30     13     14    15     16     17    38
                            29     12     3     4      5      18    39
                            28     11     2     1      6      19    40
                            27     10     9     8      7      20    41
                            26     25     24    23     22     21    42
                            49     48     47    46     45     44    43

Time for more visualization. Using the number 15 on the above illustration as the focus, we can
visualize a circle with the number 15 on its perimeter at a starting point of zero degrees. 19 is at
90 degrees, 23 is at 180 degrees, and 28 is at 270 degrees. The number 34 is directly above the
number 15 and is positioned one ring outside the "circle." Its position on the Square of Nine
directly above 15 means that 34 is 360 degrees up from 15, or one complete rotation or cycle
from 15. (28 is also outside the gray highlighted area but is not a rotation outside the "circle"
because its position has not yet completed 360 degrees, or one full rotation from 15.)

Hopefully the square within the circle visualization hasn't created any confusion. We did this
illustration so that we can put some visual perspective on the math that accomplishes the same
thing as one 360 degree rotation on the Square of Nine.

The square root of 15 is 3.87. Adding the number 2 to the square root of 15 results in 5.87. (3.87
+ 2). That result squared is 34.49. We can immediately learn two things from this exercise: One is
that the whole numbers on the Square of Nine ignore decimals and will inherently create rounding
errors; and the second is that adding 2 to the square root of a number and squaring the sum is
the same thing as a 360 degree rotation up on the Square of Nine. Subtracting the number 2 from
the square root of 15 and then squaring the difference would be the equivalent of a 360 degree
rotation down on the Square of Nine.

The Degrees to Factor Table

Now that you have the knowledge that a 360 degree move is the same as adding (or subtracting)
2 to the square root and then squaring the resulting sum or difference, we can expand this
knowledge to produce the following:




                                                                                                  9
DEGREES     =    FACTOR
360              2.00
315              1.75
270              1.50
225              1.25
180              1.00
135              0.75
90               0.50
45               0.25
22.5             0.125

Degrees to Factor Conversion Table

The factor is the whole or decimal number that is added to or subtracted from the square root of
the base number before squaring the result to move up, down or around on the Square of Nine.
This simple table is Core Knowledge. Factors not shown on the Table can be derived easily. The
factor for 67.5 degrees, for example, is .25 + .125 = .375. For most stock market work the major
factors are those for 45 degrees and the multiples of 45 degrees.

Moving Around the Square of Nine

What number is 180 degrees up from 15? The answer is 23.75. The formula is (N ^.5 + factor) ^2,
where N=15, the base number, and factor = 1 as determined from the Degrees-to-Factor table.
Raising a number to the power of .5 or 1/2 is the same as solving for the square root. This is
handy if your calculator has a power function key and does not have a square root function key.

90 degrees divides the circle into quarters, 45 degrees divides the circle into eighths, and 22.5
degrees divides the circle into sixteenths. You will find many cases where these divisions provide
resistance and support from major and minor pivot points in every time frame.

Constructing a Roadmap Chart

Let's put our knowledge to work and create something useful. Chart 1 is a price chart of the daily
high-low bars of the SP 500 (SPX) for the period from November '02 to late May '03. The low of
the bar on March 12, 2003 was 788.90. The low close of the swing occurred a day earlier on
March 11, 2003 at 800.73.




                                                                                               10
Chart 1

You can construct all the new Square of Nine stuff you see in Chart 1 on a simple price chart
printed out from Excel or any of the dozens of technical analysis or stock charting programs or
many stock charting web sites. Most of the illustrations in this book are produced from a Visual
Basic program created to do the research for this book, but with a small amount of practice you
can produce a useful Square of Nine Roadmap Chart with a pencil and a straight edge. If you can
print a plain bar chart of the SPX for the period around March 12, 2003 you can follow along with
this example.

Calculating the Horizontal Price Lines

The two obvious structures that would not be present on the Excel chart are the vertical/horizontal
grid lines and the trend lines, or as we will refer to them, the channel lines. This is how to
construct the horizontal grid lines. Pull out your calculator and do the math with the square root
of 788.9 and the factor for 180 degrees from the Degrees-Factor Table and write down the first
four or five 180 degree cycles up from the March 12 low of 788.9. Your worksheet will look
something like this:

March 12 low - 788.9
= (SQRT(788.9) + factor) ^2

180 degrees (factor = 1) =      846.07
360 degrees (factor = 2) =      905.25
540 degrees (factor = 3) =      966.42



                                                                                                11
720 degrees (factor = 4) =       1029.60

Using the price scale of the chart you printed, draw four horizontal lines on the price chart at 846
through 1029, the price levels of the 180 degree rotations you just calculated, and you will have
completed the horizontal gridlines.

Calculating the Vertical Time Lines

The vertical gridlines are the time element of the Roadmap. You calculate the time element by
taking the square root of the starting price of 788.9. The result is 28.08 which rounds to 28. Using
a compass, the increments on your straight edge, or by any other method, mark off the distance
of 28 bars from the last high-low price bar on the printed chart and draw a vertical line at that
position. Repeat one or two times.

This completes the horizontal and vertical grid and by doing nothing more you will have mapped
out likely key support and resistance prices for the SPX upswing from the March 12 low, but, of
course, we're not done yet.

Placing the Channel Lines

The lowest channel line is drawn by connecting a straight line from the starting point at 788.9
through the intersection of the first 180 degree horizontal line (846 on the chart) and the first 28
unit vertical line and extending it upward at the same angle through the other 180 degree
intersections. The procedure for the middle channel line is exactly the same but the starting point
is the intersection of the first 180 degree horizontal line (905) and the same vertical position as
the starting bar. The third channel line is done the same way one cycle higher (966).

If desired you could add horizontal grid lines at the 90 degree price levels. They can be calculated
the same way using a factor of .50 and its multiples, or you can simply split the difference
between the 180 degree horizontal lines and draw the 90 degree lines there.

Why 90 degrees and why 180 degrees? The 90 degree angle (and its multiples, 180, 270, 360…)
are very important in the stock market, particularly with daily and longer data. You will find that
many, many swings and pullbacks are stopped dead on a 90 degree angle from a pivot top or
bottom. We used a 180 degree angle, or more fittingly a factor of 1.00, to construct this daily
chart of the SPX because that particular angle is what worked the best for the swing that started
on March 12, 2002 from a price level around 800.

You do not yet have all the basic information that you need to use the Square of Nine Roadmap
Chart as an application, but you will soon enough. Chart 2, below, is an hourly chart of the DJX
from a period in May, 2003. The Hourly chart was constructed with 45 degree angles, or a factor
of .25. Study the chart for a few moments before moving on to the comments below the chart.




                                                                                                 12
Chart 2

Creating Hourly Roadmap Charts

Chart 2 was originally constructed during the late morning on May 16, 2003. At that time all the
price bars to the right of the left most vertical line (located directly under the 87.42 legend) were
missing because they had not yet occurred. We had reason to believe at the time that this hourly
pivot on the morning of May 16 could be a significant turning point. Price action over most of the
next two trading days seemed to confirm our outlook. The bounce off the 84.49 horizontal line
was not unusual and could have been expected for a couple reasons. One big reason was that
84.49 is 90 degrees down from the suspected pivot high at 87.42 and you should always expect
some sort of reaction at 90 degree angles from a major or minor pivot. The second reason was
that the bounce was occurring at the mid-point of a square. Not nearly as important as the
expected reaction on a 90 degree line, countertrend moves have a tendency to start and end at
the midpoints of the price and time squares. (Note: if you are doing the math jump to page 16.)

The tip-off that something was seriously amiss with the bearish outlook was the penetration of the
upper channel. We call this style chart the Square of Nine Roadmap Chart because price stays
within the upper and lower channel bounds for days, weeks or even months from a major turning
point. Naturally, the shorter the time period of the data in the chart the more likely price is to
exceed the outer channel bounds as trend and countertrend moves work themselves out within
even bigger trends.

When the upper channel bound was penetrated on the close for two consecutive hours it was
time to close shorts and construct a new 45 degree Roadmap chart from the suspected pivot low.
Chart 3 below was started from the May 20 pivot low after it became clear that the suspected



                                                                                                  13
down trend had busted. One practical advantage of the Roadmap chart is that it can be
constructed, channels and all, the moment that a suspected pivot occurs. The Square of Nine
Roadmap chart self-confirms the trend in progress by subsequent price movement remaining
above the lowest channel bound in an uptrend and below the highest channel bound in a
downtrend.




Chart 3

Chart 3 provides more useful information about the value of the Square of Nine Roadmap Chart
as a legitimate trading tool. If you were long off the May 20 low you could stay comfortable with
the fact that price was remaining well above the lower channel bound. Reactions were occurring,
as is normal and expected, contained within the 45 degree squares. At the time this is being
written we do not know if the 2nd rotation of the 90 degree level at 90.17 will stop the move or if it
will hit the wall at a higher level.

The most reliable price target that will most likely turn back a rally or stop a down move is the
outer diagonal channel line. The horizontal price lines often provide resistance or support in a
continuing move. Very often price will "vibrate" within a square while it trends in the direction of
the channel lines.

We believe that the Square of Nine Roadmap is a valuable trading tool in its own right, and that's
before we even get into the meat and potatoes of actually squaring price with time, or using time
to forecast price, or price to forecast time as we will in subsequent chapters.

All the examples we show in this book are daily or hourly charts. You can construct a Roadmap
chart for any ticker with any time frame from minutes to years. The principles of construction are



                                                                                                   14
exactly the same as for the daily or hourly charts you see here. You will have to do some
experimenting to determine the factor that will produce channels that faithfully contain most of the
price movement of the swing of interest over long periods relative to the time frame of the chart.
Persistence will pay off here. You may also have to do some experimenting with a three digit
conversion for the natural prices of your ticker. More on that in the next chapter.




                                                                                                 15
                           THE THREE DIGIT CONTROVERSY



The Three Digit Controversy

There are a couple things that we did not cover in the last section on constructing a Square of
Nine Roadmap Chart. One of them is what we call the three digit controversy. When we
constructed the SPX chart we calculated the spacing of the vertical time line by taking the square
root of the starting pivot price. In that example, the starting pivot price was around 800 and the
square root of 800 rounded out to a time dimension of 28 bars. The time dimension on the
Square of Nine Roadmap Charts remains constant regardless of the actual duration of the price
data. For example, the SPX chart is daily data and the time spacing is 28 trading days. The time
spacing interval would remain 28 bars for Hourly or Weekly data that started from the pivot price
level of 800 except, of course, the actual time elapsed would be 28 hours or 28 weeks.

But look again at the DJX Hourly in Chart 3. The square root of the base price of 84.26 is 9
rounded and there's no way the vertical time lines on that chart are separated by nine bars. Also,
if you’ve done the math yourself for Chart 3 you found out that 85.72 is not on a 45 degree angle
up from the DJX natural trading price 84.26. The first 45 degree angle up from the natural trading
price of 84.26, if we do the math with a .25 factor, is 88.91, so what gives?

As a general rule, when calculating price angles (the horizontal lines) and time spacing for the
Square of Nine Roadmap Charts we want to calculate with a number that has three significant
digits, or in other words, three digits to the left of the decimal point. Before doing the calculation
for the 45 degree angles and for the time spacing on the DJX charts we converted the base price
84.26 to 842.6 before taking the square root. That provided us with a time spacing of 29 bars on
the hourly Roadmap chart. The 45 degree angles we calculated for the horizontal price lines were
based on a starting price of 842.6 (84.26 x 10) and then converted back to two digits for
placement on the chart. For example, price on the first 45 degree angle up computed out to 857.2
before being converted back to the two digit 85.72 that appears on the chart. If you were using a
spreadsheet program like Excel to draw the plain price charts you could do the conversion
directly on the price data. If you print charts off the net or use a commercial charting program you
may have no choice but to do the conversions before and after calculating the angles and the
time spacing.

Using three digits for the calculations is a general rule and need not be followed religiously. If the
SPX started trading over 1,000 next week we would not even consider converting the actual price
levels to 100. Maybe if price climbed to 1,200 or 1,300 we would consider a conversion. The
basic concept we want to emphasize is that the angle (factor) selected for the grid should
produce channel lines that look like normal trend lines as much as possible. You know that you
hit the right combination if the channels reasonably contain the swing and if price is reliably
vibrating between the tops and bottoms of the individual squares. Converting natural prices to
three digits by multiplying or dividing by factors of 10 before doing the Square of Nine calculations
will change the size of the squares. Higher natural or converted prices and lower factor numbers
provide smaller price slices and smaller squares suggesting that the duration of the data itself,
hourly, daily, weekly, may be one of the most important determining conditions.

Which Price Do I Use?

When working with daily, weekly or monthly charts there can be an enormous difference between
the high or low price of a bar and the closing price of the same bar, or the highest or lowest
closing price that terminates a swing versus the most extreme price that terminates the same
swing. Which price do you use for your Square of Nine calculations?



                                                                                                   16
The best answer is to use both the highest or lowest close for a swing, and the extreme high or
low for a swing as a base price to make two separate charts. If the new swing persists you can
evaluate which base price choice is producing the most useful chart for you and discontinue the
other. Chart 4 is a remake of Chart 1 of the SPX using the close on March 11 as the base price
for the horizontal price lines in place of the intraday low on March 12 as we did with Chart 1.

One additional difference between Chart 1 and Chart 4 is that we added the 90 degree angle
horizontal price lines to Chart 4. There is no universal rule that we can apply or pass on to you
for constructing the perfect Roadmap chart for every ticker in every time frame. There is no
substitute for experimentation and experience.




Chart 4

Variations on Time Spacing

There is a peculiarity with the Square of Nine Roadmap Charts in the way that the time spacing is
calculated. This peculiarity is distinct from but related to the three digit controversy. In all our
example charts we calculated the time spacing by taking the three digit square root of the pivot
price and rounding it. The time spacing when calculated this way produces a perfectly vertical
line on the chart. A more precise method of calculation, particularly for daily charts, is to find the
square root for each 180 degree angle (assuming of course that the chart is based on 180
degrees or a factor of 1) and use that result as the time spacing on each separate horizontal line.
For example, the time spacing on the SPX chart (Chart 1) is a constant 28 bars. If we used the
variable time spacing method the bar spacing at the 720 degree angle at the price level of 1029



                                                                                                   17
would be 32 bars. This will produce time spacing bars that slant slightly to the right from bottom to
top on an uptrend but may produce better time related results, particularly at higher price levels
on extended moves.

There is one more variation on time spacing for the Roadmap charts. The explanation will
probably not make any sense to you right now, but it will when you have finished the book. As
previously explained, we calculated the time spacing for Chart 2 and Chart 3 by converting the
natural base price of 84.26 to three digits = 842.6 (84.26 x 10) and taking the square root. 842.6
^.5 = 29.02. The variation is to use the natural price 84.26 and determine the first number on the
84.26 angle of the Square of Nine that comes closet to 29.02 and then use that number as the
time spacing interval. That number in this case is 26.83, which rounds to 27 for hand drawing.

Gann Angles

Much has been written on Gann Squares and Gann Angles and Gann Fans. Almost all high end
charting programs provide them as a user choice although the help files may seem deficient in
explaining how to actually use them. We make absolutely no claims that the channel lines on the
Square of Nine Roadmap charts accurately represent any particular so-called Gann Angle, 1x1,
1x2 or any other, or that the squares resulting from the vertical and horizontal lines are Gann
Squares accurately drawn or otherwise. W.D. Gann made all his charts by hand on specially
scaled charting paper to achieve a specific rise over run for the tickers he traded. This scaling is
not easily duplicated on different sized computer screens or ink jet printers. The Roadmap charts
stand on their own, and although their method of construction is also highly suited for hand
drawing, there is no added value in defining them in terms they were never intended to match.




                                                                                                  18
                             SQUARING PRICE WITH PRICE



The technique for squaring price with price is the same technique that we used to calculate the
horizontal gridlines for the Square of Nine Roadmap Charts. By adding or subtracting specific
divisions of the circle (review the Degrees to Factor Table) to the square root of the base price
and then squaring the resulting sum or difference, we are in effect calculating support and
resistance levels straight up or straight down from the base price without regard to time.

Support and Resistance from Major Pivots

Generally you want to do these static angle calculations from only the major pivot points. We
would include in this category the all time high and low, the 10 year high and low, the 5 year high
and low, the 52 week high and low, and also the contract high and low for most futures contracts.
For thoroughness, you should do each of these calculations twice, one time with the extreme high
or low price for the bars that began and ended the swing, and one time with the highest or lowest
closing prices that began and ended the swing. As you can see, if you start to get even a tiny bit
more liberal with your definition of what constitutes a major pivot point you are going to end up
with an awful lot of numbers.

If you deal only with stock and stock related tickers, we also suggest using an angle no lower
than 180 degrees (a factor of 1) in your calculations if you intend to place all these numbers on a
chart. If you intend to keep them in an Excel spreadsheet or otherwise off the chart then go with
90 degrees for the financial markets and perhaps even 45 degrees if you are looking for
additional evidence at a suspected major turning point.

A circle has 360 degrees and not all angles are of equal importance when doing Square of Nine
calculations. Financial markets tend to respond to the 45 degree angle and to the multiples of 90
degrees (180, 270, 360) for major support and resistance. With all markets 360 degrees (a factor
of 2) represents a full cycle and the location of the 360 degree price angles from the major pivots
is always of interest when doing these static angle calculations. Bond traders tell us that 60
degrees and the multiples of 60 degrees (120, 180, 240, 300, 360) can sometimes be as
important in their market as the 90 degree multiples. We do not trade any markets associated
with anything that can be sliced, diced or stewed and can offer no opinion on whether angles
other than the usual 90 degree multiples are considered important for those markets.

There is a danger here of having so much data that there is no discernible information so you
want to be judicious in your selections. Also, we tend to use these static angle calculations from
the major pivots mostly to provide additional evidence at a suspected major turning point. If our
daily Roadmap chart were coming up to a 360 degree price level we would want to know if this
same price level was, as an example, also 10 rotations of 360 degrees down from the all time
high.

The three digit controversy raises its ugly head here too, as it does with all Square of Nine
calculations. We deal mostly with the cash and futures stock indexes and generally do convert
them to three significant digits before doing the math for these static angle calculations, and for
actual squaring operations whenever a price range is called for If the index price is "much" over
1,000 or less than 100. Because you do not have to deal with a time element for static angle
calculations you would also probably want to have an off-chart table of natural, unconverted
prices handy even if you have marked your chart with major support and resistance levels after
doing the appropriate conversion to and from three digits.




                                                                                                19
Many stocks and indexes made all time highs in 1999 and 2000 and bear market lows in 2002 so
there are dozens of recent examples where the value of this simple price on price calculation can
be backtested to your own satisfaction. The technique is simple enough to apply without
additional demonstration and it would be spiking the punch to show the most dramatic examples.

A Touch of Reality, Please

Many high flying stocks made bear market lows in the Summer and Fall months of 2002. In many
cases these lows were 80% and 90% off all time highs made a scant two years or so earlier.
During the many discussions going at the time about methods for finding a bottom in stocks this
simple technique was brought up. Examples were cited where AOL, for example, was thought to
have probably made a bear market low at the time very near the 21st 180 degree cycle down
from its all time closing high of 94 (split-adjusted). On July 25, 2002 AOL made a daily, and bear
market low of 8.70 and closed that day at 9.64. If you do the math the 21st 180 degree cycle
down from the three digit adjusted closing high is 9.33. Should the technique be dismissed out of
hand because 9.33 was not exactly the low or the close of the day that AOL made a bear market
low?

We bring this up because since we're doing mathematical applications the expectation creeps in
that the results must be accurate to within two decimal places to be useful. We hope the readers
are less rigid. Gann himself did not expect this kind of accuracy and attributed near misses to
"lost motion" or "pitch ahead or behind price." For any Square of Nine price application we apply
the notion that any bar containing the target price is a valid hit. For time applications a near miss
of one or perhaps sometimes even two bars is a valid hit. For price and time squaring
applications within two or three degrees is certainly a hit and within four or five degrees is a near
miss worth considering.

Let's review the math to see how we got from a closing high of 94 to a "price of interest" of 9.33.
We converted 94 to three digits (94 x 10) = 940 because in July, 2002 AOL was trading in single
digits. Higher raw numbers produce smaller price slices. The square root of 940 = 30.66. The
factor for 180 degrees = 1. The square of 30.66 - 21 = 93.3, which converted back from three
digits (93.3 x 1/10) = 9.33. How did we know that the 21st cycle of 180 degrees down from the all
time closing high of AOL would be important? We didn't, at least not until July 25, 2002. The
Square of Nine on many occasions will show definite predictive qualities, but you usually only
learn that after the fact. The success of turning technique into a method you can trust is not
simple and it's not easy. We can only propose that success may come to those who seek to
harness the power of the Square of Nine not to predict the future but to know when it is here.




                                                                                                  20
          CONVERTING PRICE AND TIME TO DEGRESS OF A CIRCLE



A Visualization of Spatial Relationships

Before moving ahead let's review the conceptual framework of what we have accomplished. We
started everything off with the description of the paper version of the Square of Nine. You can
view the form of the paper version in Appendix 1 if you haven't already done so. We created the
visualization of how you can turn the two dimensional Square of Nine table into a three
dimensional pyramid by grabbing the center of the table and pulling it straight up until all the sides
are perfectly shaped. Each block in the pyramid is a number in the table. This visualization
enables us to see the spatial relationships between the numbers and how they relate to each
other by angles and sides and position on the pyramid. When viewed looking down from directly
above the numeral one at the apex of the pyramid we can see how the blocks can be stretched
and pulled into the geometric shapes of a circle, a smaller triangle, and a square without losing
their spatial relationships to each other.

A little heavy on the visualization? Maybe so, but before tackling the more esoteric applications of
the Square of Nine where both price and time are interchangeable to and from degrees of a circle
we want to reinforce an awareness that the axis boundaries and the price bars on our stock
charts are really just the literal representations of the spatial relationship of price and time. And
finally, that we can precisely determine the location of these spatial relationships, in some
circumstances well into the future, by manipulating the square root of price and time's position on
the Square of Nine with the decimal equivalents of the divisions of a circle.

Price or Time Converted to Degrees - the Formula

The formula for converting a price level or a number of bars or calendar days to degrees of a
circle is straightforward and can be done on any calculator with a square root function key or a
power function key.

The formula for Excel is: MOD((SQRT( (N))*180)-225,360) where N is the price, or price range, or
time in days or bars that we want to convert.

Punching the formula into a $10 calculator is more labor intensive because of the MOD 360
business. Here's the keystroke sequence for finding the degrees of circle for the number 74.

                        Keystrokes

Step 1:   SQRT(74) * 180 = 1548.42
Step 2:    1548.42 - 225 = 1323.42
Step 3:      1323.42 / 360 = 3.676
Step 4:            3.676 - 3 = .676
Step 5:       .676 * 360 = 243.42

The only curveball is in Step 4 where you subtract 3 from 3.676. This step is necessary to
accomplish the MOD 360 function which limits the final answer to a number between 1 and 360.
For this example with N=74 you subtracted 3, the whole number to the left of the decimal point
before multiplying by 360 in Step 5. If N=265 the whole number to the left of the decimal point
would be 7 so you would subtract 7 from the intermediate result of Step 3, and so on.

The Excel table below shows the precompiled degrees for all the numerals between 1 and 225.
The Excel formula above enables you to expand this Static Degrees table to any extent desired.

The degrees of a circle for the static numbers never change. The number 152 will always be on
the 194 degrees angle, for example, and the number 9 will always be on the 315 degrees angle
when applying the formulae, whether it's a trading range of 9 points, 9 calendar days, or the
closing price on any bar.




                                                                                          22
For most of the applications going forward we will not be working directly in prices or days or bars
but with the degrees of the circle that each of those items represents. As we now know the
number of degrees will always be between 1 and 360, one complete rotation of the circle or the
sum of the angles of a square.

This formula for converting price and time to degrees, so far as we know, is attributable to Carl
Futia and has been previously published or otherwise made generally available without any
reservations. There are other formulae for determining angles but this particular method is the
least complicated and it can be implemented easily on a cheap calculator or in a spreadsheet.

The purpose of the MOD 360 function is to manipulate the result to a number between 1 and 360.
In our example above we wanted to convert the intermediate result 1323.42. We could have done
it this way. 3 x 360 = 1080 and 4 x 360 = 1440. The number 1323.42 is more than 3 x 360 and
less than 4 x 360 so if we subtract out the 3 x 360 product (1323.42 - 1080 = 243.42) we are left
with a desired number between 1 and 360.




                                                                                                 23
                              THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS



The threshold question is what does the term squaring price and time mean? For all the
applications in this book it means that price (or a price range) in degrees equals time units in
degrees, or that price is 180 degrees or 90 degrees opposed to time. For example, a price range
of 49 points squares with 81 time units because both price and time are on the 315 degree angle
of the Square of Nine.

Suppose you have a situation where you have a base price of 935.05 and you want to determine
if that price squares with 37 time units? Use the formula to calculate that 935.05 = 239 degrees.

Find the 180 and 90 degree oppositions to 239 degrees:

239 - 180 = 59 degrees (this is the same as 239 + 180 = 419 - 360 = 59)
239 - 90 = 149 degrees
239 + 90 = 329 degrees

Use the formula to calculate that 37 = 150 degrees.

The base price of 935.05 squares with 37 time units at a 90 degree offset on the Square of Nine.

The 90 degree angle and its multiples at 180, 270, 360 are considered the most "important"
angles for the financial markets and should always be considered when analyzing daily charts
and longer time frames for squaring incidents. 45 degree oppositions also square price and time.
We mentioned in a previous section that some bond traders look for 60 degree offsets in addition
to the offsets that are multiples of 90 degrees.

You can be as creative as you want to spend the time being in determining what squaring angles
are most important for the tickers you trade most frequently, or even how you can otherwise
manipulate the numbers in ways other than the ways we show here. Day traders, in particular,
seem to come up with the most creative variations which they claim to be effective for the time
periods and markets they trade. There are no rules and you are limited only by your own
imagination and the laws of mathematics.

Five Ways that Price Squares with Time

There are five primary ways that price squares with time:

•   Current price squares with time elapsed from a prior change in trend.
•   Time in a prior trend squares with the price range of the current trend.
•   Price range in a prior trend squares with time in the current trend.
•   Price ending prior trend squares with time in the current trend.
•   Price range in the current trend squares with time in the current trend.

This list begs a response to a few questions.

What does price mean? If you're working with daily bars you can usually work with the closing
price although it's often worthwhile to check results with the daily high if the prior change in trend
(CIT) was from a low, or the daily low if the prior CIT was from a high.

The price range of a swing can mean the measurement from close-to-close, from high-to-low, or
low-to-high, or close-to-high, or close-to-low. Our custom software displays price data by close



                                                                                                   24
only line charts or by regular high-low bars, and measures swings by either bar high or bar low
price or by closing price. Nothing unusual here except to say that it's OK to construct Roadmap
charts where the channels are drawn from a bar high or low based on price levels computed from
the close.

So far as we're concerned all these methods for determining a price range are equally valid.
Maybe a little visualization will help. Gann hinted that stock and commodity prices were like units
of energy that were constantly changing levels and direction, but that only got measured at
arbitrary and artificial moments in time, a minute, a day, a year. A daily bar represents a very
long time for something in constant motion at an immeasurable speed. Who's to say what
precise moment on that bar should be used to confirm a key change in energy or direction?

Here's another curveball. We work most frequently with the DJX and although we usually do a
three digit conversion when working with price range calculations in the DJX we often do not
convert the natural two digit price to three digits when working with a base price squaring.
Unfortunately we are not aware of any precise rule to follow to achieve consistent results, so the
three digit controversy continues to dog us.

Time is the number of bars or trading days, or the number of calendar days from a previous bar.
This is the only way we calculate time but there are means to turn the obvious into the complex
for those so inclined. Some people convert days to the number of hours or minutes their market
trades in a normal day. Others convert minutes to the number of degrees of earth rotation
(1degree = 4 minutes) from a certain event.

A trend is more elusive to define because a meaningful definition to you depends greatly on the
time frame in which you operate and the way you handle risk tolerance and money management.
The Roadmap charts may provide a more objective definition. A long term trend ends when price
breaks cleanly beyond the upper or lower outer channel boundary, and a short term trend ends
when the same thing happens on the hourly Roadmap chart. We use the terms trend and swing
interchangeably throughout this book.

Most trends end where the market has squared price and time but not every squaring of price and
time will end a trend. You can usually expect a reaction of some kind to occur at every squaring
although it could be a hesitation, a major but temporary pullback or even an acceleration in the
same direction. Not every method of squaring price and time will apply in every situation and
most times only one or two methods will show the square. Sometimes despite every combination
there is no apparent square to be found. Gann said that every high and low was related
mathematically to at least one other high or low and probably several. Then again, Gann used
100 year charts in his work. Not many computer traders will have the patience to do that kind of
backbreaking research.




                                                                                                25
                          SQUARING CURRENT PRICE WITH
                       TIME FROM A PRIOR CHANGE IN TREND


In this application we want to look at today's price to see if it "squares" with the number of trading
days (bars) or calendar days that have elapsed since a prior change in trend. If you're working
with daily bars you will usually use the closing price although if the closing price calculation is
inconclusive it's often worthwhile to also check results with the daily high if the prior change in
trend (CIT) was a low, or the daily low if the prior CIT was a high.

This a recent example of the application of this technique in the DJX cash, which made a low of
74.17 on March 12 after changing trend to down a few months earlier on January 13, '03. You
needed four pieces of information on March 12 to check for a squaring: the closing price (75.52),
the low price (74.17), the number of trading days (38), and the number of calendar days (58) from
January 13, 2002. It was worthwhile checking for a squaring on March 12 because the market
had put in a bullish reversal bar after making a new swing low and had closed at the high of the
day. The daily bar was a bullish Hammer in candlestick parlance. Chart 5 is what a plain chart of
the DJX looked like on March 12, 2003.




Chart 5

The conversion of time to degrees is simple enough from the Static Degrees conversion table.



                                                                                                   26
38 TD = 165 degrees
58 CD = 66 degrees

For the price side of things the first to check is the close on March 12. 75.52 = 259 degrees, 349
degrees, 79 degrees, 169 degrees (0, +90, +180, +270). 38 TD = 165 degrees. The close is
within 4 degrees of square with the trading day count at a 90 degree offset.

Let's also check for squaring with the low price on March 12. 74.17 = 245 degrees, 335 degrees,
65 degrees, 155 degrees (0, +90, +180, +270). 58 CD = 66 degrees. The low is within 1 degree
of square with the calendar day count at a 90 degree offset. You could reasonably conclude that
the DJX squared price and time on March 12. Please notice that we did not convert the DJX to
three digits before doing the calculation because we were working with a base price and not a
price range.


For another example let's do the NYSE High Beta Index (NHB) at the October 10, 2002 low. The
NHB is a cash only index. You cannot trade the index itself and there are no derivatives.
Nevertheless, it's a great index to follow because the high beta stocks tend to lead the market.
NHB Elliott Wave counts are often cleaner and always ignored at your peril.




Chart 6


For this example we're going to determine a squaring with the low price on October 10, 2002 with
elapsed time from the swing that ended on August 22, 2002.




                                                                                               27
34 TD = 105 degrees
49 CD = 315 degrees

There was no three digit conversion so the low price at 1248.55 = 15.26 degrees, 105.26, 195.26,
285.26. (0, +90, +180, +270).

34 TD = 105 degrees. The NHB low on October 10, 2002 squared with the 34 trading days
elapsed since the prior change in trend on August 22, 2002.

This is a short chapter but we have covered, in all necessary detail, the critical information you
need to square current price with time from a prior change in trend. For raw data you need the
number of bars that have elapsed from the prior trend. If you're working with daily data you
should also determine the number of calendar days that have elapsed since the prior change in
trend. Price is the closing price or the bar high or bar low price. Sometimes you may want to do
the calculations for both the high and the low price to determine if a squaring occurred
somewhere within the bar even if it was not at one of the bar extremes or at the close.

We did not convert either the DJX or the NHB natural price to three digits because we were
working with fixed prices and not price ranges. All this extra discussion is probably making the
procedure seem more difficult that it really is. Once you've worked with a few particular tickers
you will get a feel for what's required from the nuances to get consistent and reliable results.




                                                                                               28
                    SQUARING TIME IN A PRIOR TREND WITH
                   THE PRICE RANGE OF THE CURRENT TREND



The application of this technique requires three pieces of information if you are working with daily
data: the number of trading days (TD) and the number of calendar days (CD) in the prior trend or
swing, and the price range of the current swing. You can measure a price range from close-to-
close, from high-to-low, or from close-to-high or low.

With the application of all the Square of Nine techniques, once you know how to convert price
and time to degrees, the implementation of all the techniques is fairly simple. The devil is in the
details of deciding how to establish a price or a price range and when to convert natural prices
into three digits.

The period from July '02 through January '03 provides some easily distinguishable swings with
sharp edges in many of the indexes so it's a good time period in which to do backtesting and
some practice in applying this technique. It's also the very recent past so we do not have any of
the "things are different now" issues to deal with that often come up in market analysis
discussions.

Chart 7 shows the daily SPX cash for that period. The price and time ranges are from high to low
for each swing. The number of points of travel for each swing show this as a period with
tremendous opportunities for trading the major indexes.

The next two charts shows particular time periods of Chart 7 in more detail.




                                                                               30
Chart 8

On a closing price basis, from START to A there was a swing of 22 TD. If you were doing your
analysis at the close of trading at Point B you would determine if the market squared price and
time that day by measuring the close-to-close price range of the swing from A to B, converting
that price range into degrees (185.94 = 70 degrees), converting the 22 TD into degrees (22 = 259
degrees) and seeing if you got a hit. 259 - 70 = 189. Nine degrees separation from a multiple of
90 degrees is too much separation to call it a squaring. Close-to-low numbers work out to a swing
of 186.90 points = 76 degrees. 259 - 76 = 183 degrees, which provides an acceptable 3 degrees
of separation

Note that we're using rounded numbers for most of these examples. You can quickly get the
degrees for any number up to 225 from the Static Numbers to Degrees Table. The whole process
takes only seconds once the raw data is gathered together.

At Point C the price range of the swing on a closing basis is 162.11 points which is a tad more
than 266 degrees. The duration of the prior swing was 33 TDs which converts to 89 degrees
putting the price range at Point C and the time units of the prior swing within a few degrees of
square at an offset of 180 degrees. 266 - 89 = 177. If the multiple of 90 degrees happens to be
180 degrees that's even "better" and if it's 360 degrees that is the "best."




                                                                                              31
Chart 9

At Point D the prior swing was 35 CD on a closing basis and the price range on a closing basis
was about 63 points. 35 = 120 degrees and 63 = 124 degrees squaring within about 4 degrees of
unity or 360 degrees.

Point E is yet another squaring of price and time. 30 CD = 41 degrees and 56 points = 42
degrees, within about 1 degree of unity or 360 degrees.

If you're like the rest of us you probably have an entire library of books on trading and technical
analysis (thank you for adding this one). In most of those books, which may be valuable in their
own right, if there was any reference to W.D. Gann and the concept of squaring price and time it
was probably something like this "if price travels 90 points in 90 days…" How far we've come!

Because one side of the price-time comparison is fixed, the number of TDs and CDs of the prior
swing, we can use this application to examine the predictive qualities of the Square of Nine. This
is easier done if you have a copy of the Static Numbers to Degrees Table in front of you. In the
last example, the swing from D - E on Chart 9, we were working with 30 TDs. Since we already
know that 30 TDs is 41 degrees on the Square of Nine we need only look at the Table of
Numbers and Degrees to see which price ranges will square with 41 degrees. Staring in the first
column and working through the table we can pick out price ranges of about 12, 30, 56, 90, 182,
and 240 points that we know will square with 30 TDs at 360 degrees on the Square of Nine. And
since we also already know the starting price of the current swing it's simple enough to figure out
a list of future prices that will complete one of the required price ranges that will square with 30
TDs. From that point on you need only check today's bar to see if it contains a price that will
complete the square.




                                                                                                 32
It gets a little more complicated, but still manageable, when you add the 90 degree offsets that
will also square the current range with time. In addition to the above list, a complete list of price
ranges would include numbers that fell on the 131, 221, 311 degree angles as well. A shorter but
still very good list would include only the numbers that fell on the180 degree offset at 221
degrees. For the period from July '02 through January '03 that we covered in the examples all
the squarings occurred at either 360 or 180 degrees although that will not be the case for every
other ticker.




                                                                                                  33
                    SQUARING THE PRICE RANGE IN THE
               PRIOR TREND WITH TIME IN THE CURRENT TREND



For this application you need the following information: the price range of the prior trend and the
number of TDs and CDs that have elapsed in the current trend. For this example of the SPX
squaring the price range of a prior trend with TDs in the current trend, we used another example
from the Fall of 2002 which provided many distinguishable swings. Because the SPX was a three
digit price at the time no conversion was considered.




Chart 10

The high to low range of the August 22 - October 10 downswing was 196.37 points in the cash
index. Rounding to 196 and reading directly from the Conversion Table we see that 196 points =
135 degrees. From the October 10 low to the high of the next swing was 36 TDs. From the
Conversion Table we see that 36 also equals 135 degrees so the SPX has squared price and
time at what turned out to be the beginning of a 146 point downswing in the cash index.


Here's another example with a $20 stock. DELL made a swing low in September, '02 and a swing
high in November, '02 with a closing price range of 6.64 points.




                                                                                                34
If you were following DELL in early February of 2003 could you have used the price range of the
September - November upswing to get a handle on when the November-February down trend
might end?

Let's do the math. 6.64 points converted to three digits is 66.4. Plugging 66.4 into the original
formula we introduced provides a result that tells us that a price range of 6.64 points (converted
because DELL trades at two digits) falls on the 161.75 angle on the Square of Nine. We could
use the Table to determine what TDs or CDs would also fall on the 161.75 angle, or we can plug
the angle of interest into a new formula and compute the result.

The Only Other Formula You'll Ever Need

The formula to determine the relationship of all the numbers that fall on a particular angle on the
Square of Nine is:

(((2 * n) + ((2 * x)/360) + 1.25)^2 Where "n" = number of the rotation and "x" = angle of interest.
For almost every use of this formula you will start with n=1 or n=2 and repeat the calculation for
each new "n" until you have completed as many rotations as you think will be useful for the
particular application at hand.

The keystrokes for starting with n=1 and applying the formula with an angle of interest of 161.75
on a calculator with no parenthesis and a memory STO and memory RCL function key are:

2*161.75 = 323.5 / 360 = .8986 + 1.25 = 2.1486 STO
2*1= 2 + RCL = 4.1486



                                                                                                35
4.41486 ^2 = 17.2

2nd iteration:

         2*2= 4 + RCL = 6.1486
         6.1486 ^2 = 37.8

3rd iteration:

         2*3= 6 + RCL = 8.1486
         8.1486 ^2 = 66.39

The results of plugging the angle of 161.75 into the new formula and running through three
iterations gave us the number of three possible TD or CD counts on which we would look for a
change in trend (17, 37, 66).

Oh, oh. If you check the results you would find out that none of these TD/CD possibilities scored
a hit on February 10, and if this is all you had done with this technique DELL would have reversed
the down swing and launched into a 7 point rally without you.

What are we missing? Price and time "square" on the same angle on the Square of Nine, in this
particular case an angle of 161.75 degrees. In the financial markets price and time also square at
the three 90 degree offsets to the angle at interest. We should have done more work and used
the new formula to go through the same three iterations with angles of interest of 251.75, 341.75,
and 71.75, the 90 degree offsets to 161.75.

As it tuned out the 3rd iteration of the 71.75 degree offset hit on the number at 58 TDs.

We used this DELL example for a couple reasons. One reason is to introduce the second and last
formula that you will ever need to mathematically apply the Square of Nine in any market in any
time frame. The first formula converts numbers to degrees (angles) and the second formula
converts degrees to all the numbers that lie on that angle on the Square of Nine. It's easy enough
to use the second formula to also do the calculations for the three 90 degree offsets of the
primary angle, in effect, squaring the circle.

The second reason is to drive home the point that in most cases the spatial relationship between
price and time that will stop a move cold or change a trend will not jump off the chart and tell you
where it is. There is no substitute for doing the work.




                                                                                                 36
                     SQUARING PRICE THAT ENDED A PRIOR
                    TREND WITH TIME IN THE CURRENT TREND



This an easy technique to apply. You need only convert the price ( high, low or close) that ended
a prior trend to degrees on the Square on Nine with the time in TDs or CDs (converted to
degrees) of the current trend to see if the market is squaring price with time on the bar or day of
interest. Because the base price is fixed you can easily use the new formula to forecast a grid of
future TDs and CDs on which you will want to pay special attention to the market or to your
particular ticker to get a sense of an ending trend.

Let's work the same DELL chart that we used for the last example and see if there was more than
one way to get to the square of price and time on February 10, 2003.




Chart 12

The highest close of the swing ending on November 14, 2002 was 30.94. Converted first to 309.4
and plugged into the first formula we find that price lies on the 61 degree angle on the Square of
Nine. Plugging 61 degrees and each of the 90 degree oppositions of 61 degrees into the new
formula that tells us what numbers lie on the 61 degree angle shows TD and CD days of interest
of 57, 65, 75, 83. Based on the closing price of the swing that ended in November, 2002, the TD
calculation is within one day of square on February 10.



                                                                                                37
For completeness, let's do the calculation based on the highest price of the November swing. The
highest high of the same swing was 31.06, converted to three digits = 310.6, converted to
degrees = 67 degrees. Plugging 67 degrees into the new formula and jumping to the 3rd iteration
shows 58 TD as a day of interest.

On February 10, 2003 you knew that DELL squared price and time in at least two different ways.
In the previous chapter we determined that the price range of the swing that terminated in
November squared with time of the current swing on February 10, 2003. Actually, by applying
both formulae you could have known to a certainty at the close of trading on November 14, 2002,
that DELL would square price and time in two ways on February 10, 2003. What you did not
know to a certainty on February 10, 2003 was that DELL had changed trend that day and was
beginning an almost uninterrupted 40% advance. There is no mathematical or magic formula for
determining which squaring of price and time will result in a change in trend that produces a big
move but with use and experience you will develop a trader's sense of which squarings are likely
to be the most important.

We used both formulae for the DELL example in this chapter. You could have used only the first
formula, the one that converts price or time into degrees, to determine that 58 TD converts to
65.8 degrees. What's the possible advantage to having the second formula? It's easier and more
convenient to project ahead for times or prices of interest by using the second formula. If DELL
had not made a reversal on February 10, the 58th TD, we would have known that we should be
looking for that reversal on the 65th or 75th TD or CD because these numbers also lie on the 61
degree angle of the Square of Nine.




                                                                                              38
                SQUARING THE PRICE RANGE OF THE CURRENT
                  TREND WITH TIME OF THE CURRENT TREND



This particular technique is best suited for adapting to the concept that a squaring price need not
necessarily be defined only by what occurred at one absolute moment in time such as a high or a
low or a close. A daily bar, or even an hourly bar, is a very long time for a wave of energy that is
in constant motion at an immeasurable speed. Visualizing price as an energy wave can be a very
useful construct sometimes. We should be interested in all the prices that occurred during the
period it takes to complete one bar.

This technique is best suited for squaring a price range that has occurred after 100 or more bars
or calendar days. Generally speaking, the more bars or calendar days between the start date and
end date of the range the better. A very nonmathematical explanation can be illustrated with the
chart below. The chart graphs the angles for the numerals 1 - 247 as they cycle from 0 to 360
degrees.




Chart 13

Although the magnitude and shape of the sawtooth pattern does not change as the number of
bars or incidents increases, the slope of the change becomes flatter over time as the number of
bars or days increases. In effect the "noise" is reduced as time increases.

You could do this squaring calculation on a daily chart for any ticker from the first day after you
suspect that the trend has changed. You will score hits from time to time, particularly as the
number of trading days or calendar days increases, but we find that the best results on daily
charts occur with well defined trends that cover months of trading. This Excel chart of the DJX for
the period from March, 2002 to October, 2002 shows the power of this technique.



                                                                                                 39
There were 142 trading days from the peak of the Bear Market rally that ended in March, 2002 to
the Bear Market Low (to date) that occurred on October 10, 2002. The trading range from peak to
valley was 34.76 points which rounds to 35. The degree conversion for 142 trading days gives a
result of 120 degrees. A price range of 35 converts to 120 degrees. The DJX squared price and
time on October 10, 2002, the day of the Bear Market low to date, with the rally high on March 12.
If you do the math to two decimal places from the precise high to the precise low the result will
not come out a perfect 120 degrees, but at some undetermined moment within the two daily bars
on March 19, 2002 and October 10, 2002 the DJX squared price and time exactly.

Using this technique we did not get a squaring with the March 19 high at the time of the previous
Bear Market low in July. Was that a tip-off that the lower low was still to come?




                                                                                               40
                                        CONCLUSION




The purpose of this work was to explain concisely and in adequate detail some mathematical and
graphical techniques for applying the Square of Nine to real world trading situations. The
formulae for converting price and time to degrees, and for finding all the conversions that lie on a
particular angle on the Square of Nine, and the method for constructing Roadmap charts are a
solid foundation for making the Square of Nine your own. The five ways that the markets will
square price and time can provide you with knowledge that may not be obtainable by other
means. We do not claim to have covered, or even to fully understand, the boundaries of all that
can be known about the Square of Nine. We have not even touched on the work of the school
that uses degrees of longitude of the celestial bodies for their conversions.

This is above all a book about technique. A golf instructor can show you the proper techniques
that Tiger Woods uses to strike a ball, but if you want to play golf you must go out there and do it
yourself. There is no other way to develop the feel and the touch that will promote confidence in
a competitive situation. When learning and applying these techniques there is much to be said
about getting off the keyboard and using your pencil and straight edge.

W.D. Gann may or may not have had any secrets but he knew the value of persistence and hard
work. In one of his stock market courses Gann counseled that a person who wanted to make a
success of stock trading should spend one hour a day for five years studying stock charts before
making one trade. We hope that your journey has been shortened by this knowledge.

         W.D. GANN MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR MARKET PREDICTIONS

                    THE MASTER MATHEMATICAL PRICE,
                       TIME AND TREND CACLULATOR

      This chart is made on transparent plastic so that you can place
it over a daily, weekly, or monthly high or low chart and see at a
glance the position on the time and price based on the geometrical
angles. It is designed to give QUICK ACCURATE EASY CALCULATIONS: SAVE
TIME AND PREVENT ERRORS.

      The square of 12 is always important in working out time periods
because there are 12 months in a year. The square of 144 is the GREAT
SQUARE and works better than any other square both for TIME AND PRICE
because it contains all of the squares from 1 to 144. This chart is
divided into sections of 9 both for time and price because 9 is the
highest digit. Nine spaces on the daily chart equals 9 days, 9 weeks or
9 months in time periods and 9 equals 9¢ on grains, 9 points on stocks
or 90 points on cotton on the daily high and low chart.

      One column in the square of 144 contains 144. This would equal
$144 on grain. 144 points on stocks or using a scale of 10 points to
1/8 inch it will equal 1440 points on cotton.

      MASTER 144 SQUARE CONTAINS 324 square inches and each square inch
contains 64 units which gives 20,736. This is 20,736 weeks or months
and the proportionate parts of this are used for the measurement of
time and price because this is the great cycle.

THE GREAT CYCLE OF THE SQUARE OF 144.
            The time period of this square is 20,736 days, weeks or
months. One-half is 10,368 days. One-fourth is 5,184 days. One-eighth
is 2,592 days. One-sixteenth is 1,296 days. One-thirty-second is 648
days and the one-sixty-fourth is 324 calendar or market days. 1/128 is
162 days and 1/256 is 81 days or the square of 9.

WEEKLY TIME PERIODS
      THE GREAT CYCLE in weeks is 2962 and 2 days and 1/2 of this
period is 1481 weeks and 1 day. One-fourth is 740 weeks. One-eighth is
370 weeks and 2 days. One-sixteenth is 185 weeks, 1 day. One-thirty-
second is 92 weeks, 4 days and 1/64 is 41 weeks, 2 days.

MONTHLY TIME PERIODS.
      THE GREAT CYCLE in months is 681 months and 23 days. One-half of
this 28 years, 9 months and 23 days. One-fourth is 14 years, 5 months
and 8 days. One-eighth is 7 years, 2 1/2 months. One-sixteenth is 43
months and days. The weekly and monthly time periods from any major
high and low can be checked to determine the future trend.

                                                                     43
THE MASTER NUMBERS:
            The Master Numbers are 3,5,7,9, and 12. The No. 9 and is
multiple is the most important because 9 digits added together equal
45. The next number of greatest importance is 7, the number mentioned
more times in the Bible than any other number. There are 7 days in the
week and 7 calendar days as well as 5 market days, and their multiples
should be carried on your Daily, Weekly and Monthly Charts. The square
of 7 is 49, which is a very important time period. The second square of
7 is 98 and the third square of 7 is 147 and the fourth square of 7 is
196 and 196 is also the square of 14. The next number in importance is
No. 5 which is the balancing number between 1 and 9. The square of 5 is
25 and the second square of 5 is 50 which is just 1 over the square of
7 making 49 to 50 very important for a change in trend. Three squares
of 5 is 75 and 5 squares of 5 is 100 and 100 is the square of 10, which
is also important for changes.

      The No. 3 is mentioned in the Bible next to the No. 7 and three
is important because 3 x 3 equals 9, the square of 3, and it is the
first old number that forms a square greater itself. Three must be used
in every way possible, 3 x 7 equals 21, 3 x 5 equals 15, 3 x 9 equals
27 and 3 x 12 equals 36, very important because it is the square of 6.
The No. 12 is also spoken of in the Bible many time and is of great
importance. Jesus selected 12 deciples. There are 12 months in a
year, and 12 signs of the Zodiac. The important 12's in the square of
144 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96,108, 120,132 and 144. These are
all important for both time and price in days, is weeks and months.

      Referring to the No. 9, 7 x 9 is 63 and is a great importance
because the square of 8 his 64, therefore, around 63 to 64 is very
important to watch the change in trend. 7 x 12 is 84 and this is of
very great importance and the No. next to this is 90, which is 10 x 9
and 90 is one-quarter of the circle, which is very important for time
and price changes. Next in importance is 9 x 12 which is 108 or three-
quarters of 144.

      The importance of the circle of 360 deg. must not be overlooked
in connection with the square of 144 because the proportionate parts of
the circle agree with the parts of 144. 2 1/2 times 144 equals 360 1
1/4 times 144 equals 180, 1/2 of the circle, and 90 is 5/8 of 144. 9
is 1/16 of 144, 18 his 1/8, 27 is 3/8, 36 is 1/4, 45 is 5/16 and always
very important for time and price changes and for resistance levels.
48 is 1/3 of 144 and 54 is 3/8 and 63 to 7/16, 72 is one-half of 144,
81 the square of 9, is 9/16 of 144 and 90 is 5/8, 99 is 11/16, 108 is
3/4, 117 his 13/16, and 126 is 7/8 and 135 is 15/16 of 144. These are
the most important in the square of 12 and should be watched closely
when time periods in days, weeks or months reach these points on the
Master Calculator. Remember that you should always watch the Daily
Chart for the first indication of the change in trend and at the same
time look at the position on the Weekly Chart or seven day time periods
which is next in importance. The Monthly Chart is of the greatest

                                                                      44
THE IMPORTANCE OF 3 AND 5
      The movement in PRICE and TIME whether on a Daily, Weekly or
Monthly chart has three important points, the PRICE, the TIME AND
VOLUME of sales, the PITCH OR TREND which is the geometrical angle
which shows whether time is influencing and driving prices up or down
on a slow angle or an acute fast moving angle. To there are also for
other factors that influence prices, PRICE, TIME AND VOLUME AND
VELOCITY. Time is the most important factor because when time is up
volume increases and the velocity or speed of the market increases and
the PITCH or TREND on the angles moves up faster or down faster

      There are three other important points to consider on a Daily,
Weekly or Monthly High and Low chart. These are the LOW PRICE, the
HIGHEST PRICE and the RANGE her for a or 1/2 between the high and the
low.

FIVE FACTORS FOR TIME AND PRICE
      These are high, low, halfway point, opening and closing prices.
The trend is indicated by the closing price, especially when the market
is very active. If the price closes above the halfway point or near
the high, the trend is up. If it closes below the halfway point or
near the low, the selling is greater than the buying and the trend is
down, at least temporarily. In connection with the Master Time and
Trend Calculator apply all of the rules with the Master Time Factor and
geometric angles.

STRONGEST POINTS FOR TIME AND PRICE RESISTANCE
      In using the Master Square of 144, the strongest points are 1/4,
1/3, 2/3, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8 and the complete square of 144.

      The points were the most angles cross are the strongest for
resistance and PRICE and TIME.

TRIANGLE POINTS
      the triangle points or way of the green angles cross are the most
important. These are 72, 144, 36, 48, 96, 108 and of course, 72, and
at the end of the square of 144 at the top and the bottom.

SQUARES IN THE SQUARE OF 144
      These squares were the angles cross are of great importance for
time and price resistance. These are 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 90, 108, and
at the top of the square of 144 at the top and the bottom. When the
price is at point equal to 36 and the time periods in days, weeks or
months is at 36, TIME and PRICE is SQUARE and it is important to watch
for change in trend. With the square of 144 you can get any square
from 1 to 144. Suppose you want to get the square of 72; you move
across to 72 for time and if the prices is at 72 moving up on the
chart, PRICE and TIME have balanced, or squared out, and are at the 45
degree angle and at the halfway point on the Master Price, Time and
Trend Calculator.

                                                                         45
WHERE TO WATCH FOR CHANGES IN TREND
      Most changes in trend occur when the TIME PERIODS are at one-half
of the square of 144 and happy and of a square or at the 1/3, 2/3,1/4,
and 3/4 points in the square of 144; you must always watch the square
and time of the HIGHEST PRICE and the MINOR HIGHS and LOWS, also the
square in TIME of the LOWEST PRICE and the SECOND or THIRD higher
bottom, and also the time required to square the Range and where this
square works out in the Master Square of 144.

      EXAMPLE: the lowest price that wheat ever sold was 28¢ per
bushel, In March, 1852, therefore, every 28 months would square the
lowest price. The highest price that wheat ever sold for was in May
11, 1917 when the May option sold at 325, therefore, it would require
325 months to square the highest price. The lowest price that the May
option ever sold was 44¢, therefore, it would require 44 months in time
to square the low price. The range between 44 and 325 is 281¢ which
would require 281 months, 281 weeks or 281 days to square the Range.
You would look on the Master Chart and see that 2 squares of 144 equal
288, therefore, you would watch for a change in trend between 281 and
288 or near the end of the second square of 144. 7 x 44, the extreme
low, equals 308, therefore 6 1/2 times 44 would equal 286, which is
within two points of the end of the square of 144 or the end of the
second square making 286 and important time period to watch for a
change in trend. In squaring the range of 325, the highest price for
May wheat with the 2 squares of 144 and 17 over, therefore, when the
time reached 36 days, weeks or months in the Master Square of 144 you
can see that resistance would be met because moving up the time period
of 136 you see that the 45 deg. angle moving down from 72, which is the
INNER SQUARE and the line drawn across from 36 on the price scale
crosses at 36. In this way you can see that the Master Chart would
indicate a resistance in time and price corresponding with the square
of the highest price, the lowest price, and the Range. All other time
periods from a high price, low price, of the range of any commodity or
of the stock averages or individual stocks should be worked out in this
same way.

      You will succeed in using the Master Mathematical Price, Time and
Trend Calculator by going over the charts and laying the calculator
over them and working out past history. In this way you will learn just
how it works and prove to yourself the great value of the Master
Calculator.

HOURLY TIME PERIODS
      When markets are very active and making a wider range in price,
it is important to keep an Hourly High and Low Chart, just the same as
you keep the Daily High and Low Chart and the Hourly Chart will give
the first change in trend.

      There are 24 hours in the day, therefore, 6 days are required to
pass through 144 and a total of 864 days to pass through the square of
144.


                                     -4-




                                                                         46
      At the present time, all exchanges are open 5 days a week with
the exception of holidays and most of them are open 5 hours each day,
therefore, it will require 28 days and 4 hours to pass through 144 at
the rate of 5 hours per day and 5 days per week.

GREAT YEARLY TIME CYCLE
      To pass through the square of 144, which equals 20,736, it
requires 56 years, 9 months and 23 days, which is very important time
cycle. Next is importance is 1/2 of this time period which is 28
years, 5 months and 8 days and 1/4 which is 14 years, 2 months and 19
days. The 14 years cycle is always very important because it is 2
seven year periods. 14 years equals 168 months and 169 months is the
square of 13 making it very important for a change in trend and this is
also an important time resistance point.

      1/8 of the Great Cycle if 7 years, 1 month and 10 days and is
quite important. 1/16 is 42 months and 20 days, 1/32 is 21 months and
10 days. This is an important time period because it is close to 22 1/2
months which 1/16 of the circle of 360 degrees.

NINE SPACES AND NINE TIME PERIODS
      The chart being divided up into 9 sections gives all the squares
of 9 for price resistance and time resistance which, as referred to
above is 9¢ on the Daily Chart for grains and the same for Weekly and
Monthly Charts; that is, 1¢ to each 1/8 inch. For different
commodities, different scales are used. (See special instructions for
the different commodities.)

      The Chart being divided up into 9 sections gives a 16 the squares
of 9 for price resistance or time resistance which, as referred to
above, is 90 points on the Daily Chart, 135 on the Weekly Chart, and
270 on the Monthly and 2880 on the 20 point scale and 9 spaces equal
180 points.

      The angles in red are all drawn on the squares of 9. The Inner
Square of 450 is drawn from 72 because 72 is 1/2 of 144. These angles
come out at 72, 144 and 72.

      The straight lines are in green and are 1/3 of the square of 144
in price or time.

GREEN ANGLES
      The green angles are the angles of 2 x 1 which are up two spaces
or 2 points in one period of time. The other angle below the 450 angle
is the angle of 1 x 2 which requires 2 time periods to move up 1 space
or 1 cent per bushel on grains for each time period of 1 day, week or 1
month. These angles move down from the top at the rate of 2 points or
2 spaces per time period or at the rate of 1/2 space, 1/2 point or 1/2
cents per time period. The distance that the green angles and the red
angles are apart determines how far prices can advance or decline.

      When the market enters the INNER SQUARE it is important for a
change in trend and time angles and Position in the square tell at the
time it entered whether the price is going up or down. Also when price
breaks below the 45 deg. on the INNER SQUARE it shows weakness in
proportion to the time from high or low price.

                                                                         47
WHEN TO START A NEW SQUARE
      When the time period of the Daily, Weekly or Monthly Charts has
moved 144 you began a new square. But to get the position you simply
move the Master Square over to 144 and place it over the chart to get
the position in the next square.

STRONGEST AND WEAKEST POINTS
      Where the greatest number of angles cross or bisect each other in
the square of 144 are the points of greatest resistance, such as where
the 25 and 2 x 1 angles cross each other.

       Study and practice on past action of the market and you will soon
learn how to determine the trend very quickly by using the Master
Chart.

HOW TO USE THE MASTER SQUARE OF 144:
      Follow all rules on angles as given in the Master Forecasting
course.

      Place this chart at the bottom or 0 on the daily, weekly or
monthly chart or place the bottom of the chart on the low price or
square of the high price, the low price, and the square of the range in
show where time and price balances.

      When you figure the halfway point of the extreme high or the
halfway point of the range, place either the top of the bottom of the
chart on the halfway point and it will give the correct POSITION and
TREND. However, if you will place the CENTER, or 72, on the halfway
point in PRICE you will then get the correct position in time and can
see how the price is working out with time and the MASTER SQUARE of 144
and the INNER SQUARE which starts from 72, the gravity center or 1/2
point of the square.

CALENDAR DAYS AND MARKET DAYS
      For any kind of chart, we move over one space for each unit of
time. Therefore, it would require 144 market days or 144 calendar days
to complete the square of 144. When prices pass out of one square into
another, a change in trend usually takes place and the periods and
geometrical angles on this Master Chart will tell you which way the
trend is going to change.

LEAP YEARS
      In calculating time periods to get the exact number of days and
weeks the LEAP YEAR must be figured and one extra day added. From 1864
the Leap Years were as follows: 1868; 1872; 1876; 1880; 1884; 1888;
1892; 1896; 1904; 1908; 1912; 1916; 1920; 1924; 1928; 1932; 1936; 1940;
1944; 1948 and 1952.

                                                                        48
POSITION WITH MASTER SQUARE
      To get the position with the MASTER SQUARE of 144 lay it over the
Daily, Weekly or Monthly and start from the extreme low, extreme high,
0 or 1/2 point of the range or 1/2 of the high selling price. You can
also place the top of the chart at the high selling price. In this way
you can get the correct time and position or angles at a glance.

      Place MASTER CALCULATOR on January to twelve year periods, each
month same way.

      You should have all time periods from important highs and lows
calculated in days, weeks and months in order that you can look them up
quickly on the MASTER CHART.

      With all time periods brought up to date in this way, you can get
the position on the MASTER CHART and the indicated trend without
looking at a daily, weekly or months chart. You should have the time
periods and months from every important top and bottom.

      With the MASTER SQUARE of 144, your work will be cut down but you
must learn to practice and bring up all time periods and study the
MASTER SQUARE and learn how to use it to get tops and bottoms
accurately. Work and practice will bring PRECISION and PROFITS. I
have done my part. It is now up to you to work hard and if you do,
your success is assured.




                                                                        49
     SQUARE OF NINE

     You have already had the MASTER SQUARE OF TWELVE explained,
which represents days, weeks, months and years, and the
measurements of TIME in the Square of Twelve or the Square of the
Circle.

     The SQUARE OF NINE is very important because nine digits
are used in the measuring everything, and we cannot go beyond 9
without starting to repeat and using the 0. If we divide 360° by
9, we get 40, which measures 40°, 40 months, 40 days, or 40
weeks, and shows why bottoms and tops often come out on these
angles measured by one-ninth of the total circle.

     If we divide our 20 year period, or 240 months, by 9, we
get 26-2/3 months, making important angle of 26-2/3°, months,
days or weeks. Nine times nine equals 81, which completes the
First Square of Nine. Note the angles and how they run from the
main center. The Second Square of Nine is completed at 162.
Note how this is an opposition to the main center. The Third
Square of Nine is completed at 243, which would equal 243 months
or three months over our 20 year period and accounts for the time
which often elapses before the change in the Cycle, sometimes
running over three months or more. The Fourth Square of Nine
ends at 324. Note the angles of 45° cross 325, indicating a
change in cycles here. To complete the 360° requires Four
Squares of Nine and 36 over. Note that 361 equals a square of 19
times 19, thus proving the great value of the Square of Nine and
working out the important angles and proving out discrepancies.

     Beginning with "1" at the center, note how 7, 21, 43,
75,111, 157, 211, 273 and 343 all fall on a 45° angle. Going the
other way, note that 3, 13, 31, 57, 91, 133, 183, 241 and 307
fall on an angle of 45°. Remember there are always four ways you
can travel from the center following an angle of 45°, or an angle
of 180° or an angle of 90°, which all equal about the same when
measured on a flat surface. Note that 8, 23, 46, 77, 116, 163,
218, 281 and 353 are all on an angle from the main center also
note that four, 15, 36, 61, 96,130,190, 249 and 316 are on an
angle from the main center, also note that four, 15, 34, 61, 96,
130, 190, 249 and 316 are on an angle from the main center, all
of these being great resistance points and measuring out
important time factors and angles.

Study the SQUARE OF NINE very carefully in connection with the
MASTER TWELVE and 360° CIRCLE CHART.




                                                                 50
                       SIX SQUARES OF NINE

     We are sending you six permanent Charts, each containing 81
numbers. The first Square of Nine runs from 1 to 81. Everything
must have a bottom, top, and four sides to be a square or cube.
The First Square running up to 81 is the bottom, base, floor or
beginning point. Squares #2, 3, 4 and 5 are the four sides,
which are equal and contain 81 numbers. The Sixth Square of Nine
is the top and means that it is times times as referred to in the
Bible, or a thing reproducing itself by being multiplied by
itself. Nine times nine equals 81 and six time 81 equals 486. You
can also use 9 time 81, which would equal 729.

     The No. 5 is the most important number of the digits
because it is the balance or main center. There are four numbers
on each side of it. Note how it is shown as the balancing or
center number in the Square of Nine.

     We square of the Circle by beginning at 1 in the center and
going around until we reach 360. Note that the Square of Nine
comes out at 361. The reason for this is it is 19 times, and the
1 to begin with and one over 360 represent the beginning and
ending points, 361 is a transition point and begins at the next
circle. Should we leave the first space blank and make it "0"
than we would come out at 360. Everything in mathematics must
prove. You can begin at the center and work out, or began at the
outer rim and work in to the center. Begin at the left and work
right to the center or to the outer rim or square.

     Note the Square of Nine or the Square of the Circle where
we begin with 1 and rune up the side of the column to 19, then
continue to go across until we have made 19 columns, again the
square of 19 by 19. Note how this proves up the circle. One-half
of the circle is 180°. Note that in the grand-center, where all
angles from the four corners and from the East, West, North and
South reach gravity center, number 191 appears, showing that this
point we are crossing the Equator or Gravity center and are
starting on the other half of the circle.

     We have astronomical and astrological proof of the whys and
wherefores and the cause of the workings of geometrical angles.
When you have made progress, proved yourself worthy, I will give
you the Master Number and also the Master Work.

     Study the human body in every way and you will find that it
is the work of a Master Mind, and when once you know yourself and
know your body, you will know the Law and will understand all
there is to know. Remember there is a source of all supply and
that you have within you the power to know all there is to know,
but you must work hard, seek and you shall find.

The number one problem users have with our training software is data formatting. The
training software uses only ASCII data files. Most data collection software has an export
function that allows the user to convert the software's proprietary format into ASCII.

The required ASCII format for the training software is as follows:

DATE           TIME      OPEN     HIGH     LOW     CLOSE       VOLUME (optional
mm/dd/yyyy     hhmm                                            but not used)

Every data file needs a time field even if End of Day. Use 1600 for EOD data if the time
field has to be manually inserted.

The data delimiter can be a comma, space or tab. The software would prefer to see a
comma delimiter, which has been the standard since the first main frames, but spaces
and tabs will also work.

With the exception of .prn, which is reserved for AnalyzerXL exports, there is no
limitation on the name of the file extension. .txt, .asc. dat, and any other combination
(with the exception of .prn) will work equally as well.

AnalyzerXL
We use AnalyzerXL for all our EOD stock, index, mutual fund and futures data. The file
extension .prn is reserved exclusively for this exact set-up. AnalyzerXL has an automatic
export macro which makes data collection very easy indeed. Here's a screenshot of the
AnalyzerXL data collection set-up. It is difficult to read at normal viewing size but still
conveys the simplicity of the procedure. The data format for AnalyzerXL exports is
different from regular ASCII but that exception is handled automatically by the .prn
extension, which is attached automatically by AnalyzerXL.


                                                                                           55
The corollary is that unless your data export is going to look exactly like this do not use
the .prn file extension.
