1. THE THEORY BEHIND TIME RELATIONSHIPS IN
MARKETS

INTRODUCTION

Since the early days of man, scholars, philosophers, mathematicians and scientists have
endeavored to prove that nature and the universe grow in harmony to some natural
law of vibration. Sufficient proof exists that all forms of life and matter vibrate to
some natural law of harmonics. In modern times such inventions as the telephone,
radio and television rely on the vibration of invisible frequencies transmitted though
another medium. These vibrations cannot be seen, heard or felt by us yet they are part
of our daily lives and we now take them for granted. Modern science indicates that all
matter emits vibrations. Vibrations start from the Sun which is believed to control the
universe and effect all things. Plants grow in harmony with cycles of the year, crops
planted at specific times of the year grow more favorably than those out of harmony
with their most favorably cycle. Life itself evolves around cycles of the universe and
the planetary aspects. The Moon creates a pattern of rising tides and feeding habits
for marine life. Night becomes day and day becomes night, the oceans rise and fall,
economic conditions expand and contract, the path of life continues to unfold in some
strict relationship with the past.

Since most of the natural occurrences in nature revolve and evolve around cycles and
vibrations they can be accurately measured. The principles that apply in all forms of
nature also apply to the markets, as these are merely a reflection of human nature and
the ingenuity of man himself.

NATURAL TIME CYCLES

PLANETARY CYCLES

The center of our universe is the Sun. The planets of our universe revolve around the
Sun in set cycle periods. These cycle periods are known as a PLANETARY YEAR.

Earth 365 Days 7 Hours or 1 Year
Mercury 87.9 Days or 0.24085 Year
Venus 224.7 Days or .61521 Year
Mars 687 Days or 1.88089 Years
Jupiter 4332.7 Days or 11.862 Years.
Saturn 29.45772 Years.

Uranus 84.01529 Years.

Neptune 164.7883 Years.

LUNAR PHASES

The Moon Orbits Around The Earth every 29.53 Days And Passes Though Two
Major Phases, New Moon and Full Moon.

A new moon occurs when the Moon is in complete darkness (this is when the Moon
travels between Earth and the Sun, a Solar eclipse occurs when the New Moon coin-
cides with a Lunar node [crossing of the ecliptic path of the Earth’s orbit around the
Sun]). The full moon occurs when the moon is at its brightest. This is around the
time of it’s orbit when it is opposite the Sun.

SEASONAL CYCLES OF AN EARTH YEAR (4 SEASONS)

The annual cycle of the earth takes it through seasonal changes. These changes effect
the patterns of human nature as weather changes from warm to cold. Producers can
only grow some agricultural crops at certain times of the year. Due to weather incon-
sistency some years are years of abundance and others are years of shortage. Depend-

Chp.1 Page. 2

ing on the stocks being stored as carry over, prices will rise and fall to form a cyclic pat-
tern. Natural resources are also affected by seasonal demand, production will be more
prolific at certain times of the year due to weather conditions, economic conditions
and demand by industry. A good example of seasonality is the way the cost of Oil rises
during a particularly cold winter.

Seasonal tendencies help to form cyclic patterns in most markets.

Each planet moves faster or slower in relationship to its wheel, regular cycles of relationships in posi-
tion to each other often develop for a time. These cycles have been used by man to predict future
changes in years past, sometimes a psychological reason develops as to the importance of
planetary positions. On its own this could be reason enough for changes in market conditions.

ASTROLOGICAL CYCLES

The astrological year begins at the MARCH 21st EQUINOX. This is when the Sun
crosses the EQUATOR into the Northern hemisphere.

This time is known as 0 degrees when dividing the year into a 360 degree circle. This
is the time of the Sun entering the house of ARIES.

There are 12 signs of the Zodiac and each 30 degree progression through the circle of
one year takes us into another star sign of the Zodiac.

SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC POSITION INDEGREES

ARIES 21st MARCH 0-360 degrees CARDINAL sign of FIRE
TAURUS 21st APRIL 30 degrees FIXED sign of EARTH

GEMINI 21st MAY 60 degrees COMMON sign of AIR

CANCER 21st JUNE 90 degrees CARDINAL sign of WATER

LEO 21st JULY 120 degrees FIXED sign of FIRE

VIRGO 21st AUGUST 150 degrees COMMON sign of EARTH
LIBRA 21st SEPTEMBER 180 degrees CARDINAL sign of AIR
SCORPIO 21st OCTOBER 210 degrees FIXED sign of WATER
SAGITTARIUS 21st NOVEMBER 240 degrees COMMON sign of FIRE
CAPRICORN 21st DECEMBER 270 degrees CARDINAL sign of EARTH
AQUARIUS 21st JANUARY 300 degrees FIXED sign of AIR

PISCES 21st FEBRUARY 330 degrees COMMON sign of WATER

The cardinal points (90 DEGREE INTERSECTIONS) of the astrological year have a
major significance when we come to analyze the past turning points in markets. From
a cyclic viewpoint we should remember these dates as they can often have a profound
effect on human nature and human behavior for reasons beyond normal comprehen-
sion.

NATURAL TIME CYCLES

MOST IMPORTANT SEASONAL DATES OF THE YEAR

The 90 degree annual astrological dates are strong times for change, their significance
is greatly enhanced when other planetary cycles such as full or new moons, planetary
conjunctions or oppositions coincide with their anniversaries.

21st March EQUINOX when the Sun crosses the equator into the Northern Hemisphere, day and
night have an equal length this the 0 degrees CARDINAL point of the year.

21st September EQUINOX when the Sun crosses the equator into the Southern Hemisphere, day
and night have an equal length this is the 180 degree CARDINAL point in a year.

21st June SOLSTICE when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky over the Northern hemi-
sphere. This is the longest day and also 90 degrees a CARDINAL point in the year.

21st December SOLSTICE when the Sun reaches its lowest position in the sky over the Northern
hemisphere. This is the shortest day and also 270 degrees a CARDINAL point in the year.

NATURAL TIME CYCLES

SUMMARY ON IMPORTANT TIMES THAT COULD SIGNAL A
CHANGE

Astrological times of the year between the 20th and 22nd of each month when Earth
passes into another star sign, these are possible times for a change. If these times coin-
cide with other planetary phenomena they have a stronger significance for change.
The impact of major lunar phases (new or full moon) occurring at these times appears
to strengthen the possibilities. A Solar eclipse or Lunar eclipse would seem even more
important to monitor. The March equinox always seems to signal a turn in some
market each year.

It is not really important to know the reason why these dates or planetary configura-
tions are significant for a change, only to be aware of their influence on human nature
and that group of traders who believe in the importance of these times for new begin-
nings.

If a market is susceptible to the likely possibility of a change in trend it is more prob-
able to occur at these times. We must recognize this possibility and seize the oppor-
tunity to trade should it be available.

As we progress it will be seen that we do not require anything but a basic knowledge
of astrology. The main way we track these time relationships is by their very repetition.

REPETITION OF THESE IMPORTANT TIMES WILL HOLD A MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE
PAST, DUE TO THE CYCLIC NATURE OF THE MARKETS. BY CONSTANTLY MONITORING CYCLES
AND IMPORTANT ASTROLOGICAL DATES WE CAN ALWAYS BE AWARE OF IMPORTANT TIMES
THAT GIVE US ADVANCE WARNINGS FOR AN IMPENDING CHANGE IN TREND IN THE MARKETS
THAT WE FOLLOW.

Research of the past will show how consistently the astrological time periods through
the year mark major turning points in most markets. These times may only be a coin-
cidence but from a technical level they are very important to watch.

Some of the many tools I use for monitoring future markets and researching the past
are these natural times of the annual cycle.

By graphically illustrating the earthly progressions in degrees on a circle of one year
below a price chart, one can quickly judge the effectiveness of these time periods.

The reason that the lunar oscillator fails to peak sometimes is due to a new or full moon falling over
a non trading day.

2. THE SCIENCE OF MATHEMATICS

PYTHAGORAS delivered the MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS OF THE LAW OF CYCLES to his
spiritual community at Crotona, Italy in the sixth century B.C. All of the cosmos, he taught, is
comprehensible through numbers because the material universe is born from their very es-
sence. By knowing the secret of the numbers behind cosmic cycles, the initiate could approach a
powerful understanding of the workings of the universe. So vast were the implications of this
knowledge that the Pythagoreans kept it in strictest silence.

ANCIENT GEOMETRY

The basic geometric forms are :- SQUARE - CIRCLE - TRIANGLE - RECTANGLE

Sacred mathematical ratios have been enshrined in such works as the Parthenon of
Greece and the Great pyramids of Egypt. PHI, PI and the sacred roots of 2 and 5.

A SQUARE

If we use a square as our starting point we can then draw a circle, a triangle and a rec-
tangle and prove that strict relationships exist. These relationships will never vary,
they are an exact science.

If a geometric form is square then each side will be equal to the other sides.

When a square is divided by a diagonal line to form two triangular halves the length of
the diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theory for right angle triangles.

If the sides of a square are equal to 1 unit then the diagonal of a square will be equal
to the square root of 2. The diagonal of a square will be 1.41421 times the value of the

side.

The first set of ratios that we see as important once we study a square divided by a
diagonal are:-

A CIRCLE

The circumference (distance of the 360 degree arc) is measured using the Greek
numerator PI.

PI is equal to 3.141593 sometimes commonly expressed as 22/7 this number is very
close to the same value as Root 2 (1.414) multiplied by Root 5 (2.236) or Root 2
(1.414) plus Root 3 (1.732).

The formula for measuring the circumference of a circle is :-
Pi times DIAMETER

The diameter of an outer circle of a square will be 1.41421 times the side of the square. The
diameter of an inner circle of a square will be equal to the side of a square.

The inter-relationship between PI, 1, Root 2, Root 3, Root 4 (2), Root 5 and PHI are
absolute.

A TRIANGLE

The simplest triangle can be formed by dividing a square in half with a diagonal line
from opposing corners. The length of this diagonal can be measured using the
Pythagorean theorem. The length of the HYPOTENUSE in any right angle triangle
will be equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

A diagonal of a triangle formed by dividing a square into half will be 1.41421 times the
side of the square.

A diagonal triangle formed by dividing a square into quarters will have a value in
relationship to half the square root of five or 2.23606

This diagonal of a square with a side equal to 1 is equal to the square root of 1.25 or
1.118034 + When this value is added to half the side of the square (0.5) we can have
the base of a Golden rectangle which is the irrational 1.618034 represented by the
Greek symbol PHI.

Thus we have a binding relationship of root 2 (1.414), root 5(2.236) and Phi(1.618).
Also 2.236 less 1.618 = 0.618

A GOLDEN RECTANGLE

A Golden rectangle is a rectangle where the length of the longest side is 1.618034
times the length of the shorter side. A Golden Rectangle is formed from a square
and has a direct relationship with a square. To form a Golden rectangle the length of
a diagonal line drawn from one corner of a square to the center of one side forming a
triangle that divides off one quarter of that square, is added to half the base of the
square to form the base of the golden rectangle.

The value 1.618034 is represented by the Greek letter PHI.

The irrational number 1.61803+ or PHI has several remarkable properties. Its square,
for example, is equal to itself plus 1.000 (2.61803 +), while its reciprocal equals itself
less 1.000 (0.61803 + ).

THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA

The Great Pyramid of GIZA has encoded in its structure all of the ancient ratios of
PHI and PI. Its design is a monument to the science of mathematics. For anyone inter-
ested I would recommend a book by Peter Lemesurier "THE GREAT PYRAMID
DECODED".

Figure 2.7 illustrates the ratios of height to base HEIGHT = 127.2 BASE = 200
DIAGONAL SIDE = 161.8

THE ANGLE OF INCLINATION IS 51 degrees 51 minutes. 14 seconds. If you had a
circle with a circumference of 1.618034 and you were to remove an arc of 51-51-14 you
would end up with an arc of (360 - 51.854) / 360 x 1.618034 or 1.384 (1.618 less .234).

51 degrees 51 minutes is in decimal format 51.8 - A right angle is 90 degrees if you
take 51.8 from 90 you get 38.2 (0.618*0.618).

FIBONACCI NUMBER SERIES

For those not familiar with the Fibonacci series, the series begins at 1 and generates
new numbers in the series with an increase in value of approximately 61.8% It would
not commonly be known how Leonardo Fibonacci arrived at his famous series, but it
would be fair to assume that it was as a result of his observations of the Great
Pyramids of Egypt.

Leonardo Fibonacci, was reputed to be the greatest mathematician of the middle ages. His
published works include LIBER ABACI year 1202, PRACTICA GEOMETRIAE year 1220 and LIBER
QUADRATORUM.

The famous series takes on the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and so
on into infinity. As the numbers advance they become closer in ratio to PHI the
Greek symbol for the ancient ratio of 1.618034

As an example the number 144 is 1.618034 times the value of 89.

To further understand the importance of PHI in mathematics one needs to study the
geometric formation of a logarithmic spiral derived from the Golden Rectangle.

I would like to offer the following explanation on how Fibonacci derived this famous
series.

If we take the Golden Rectangle as a starting point and draw a diagonal line to divide
the Rectangle in half, we then have two right angle triangles each with adjacent sides
of length 1 and 1.618034 , This is a GOLDEN TRIANGLE. To find the length of this
diagonal line we use the Pythagorean Theorem.

In any right angle triangle the length of the Hypotenuse is equal to the square root of
the sum of the squares of the other two sides. As a mathematical formulae this equates
to :-

The Diagonal = Square root [ (1x1) + (1.618034x1.618034) }
= Square root [ 1+2.618034 }
= Square root [ 3.618034 ]

= 1.90211

Chp. 2 Page. 16
ANCIENT GEOMETRY

In the pure mathematical sense we should be aware that the number 2 in the Fibonac-
ci Series is a rounding of this value.

To obtain the next value in the series we need to expand the Golden rectangle to its
next perfect degree. This is easily demonstrated by increasing each side by the value
of PHI 1.618034 ie SIDE 1 x 1.618034 and SIDE 1.618034 x 1.618034

We now have a rectangle with sides 1.618034 and 2.618034 if we apply the same math-
ematics, demonstrated just now, to find the length of the diagonal of the first Golden
Rectangle, we can prove that this new diagonal has increased in value by PHI 1.618034

New Diagonal = Square root [( 1.618034 x 1.618034 ) + ( 2.618034 x 2.618034)]
= Square root [ 9.472136 }
= 3.07768
The relationship of the new diagonal to the first is illustrated as:-
New Diagonal divided by Original Diagonal :-
1.90211 into 3.07768 equals 1.618034
This Then Proves That All Future Diagonals Will Increase By 1.618034 Should We Expand The Sides Of
The Golden Rectangle In Powers Of Phi. The Relationship Of Phi Now Holds An intriguing Significance

To The Science Of Mathematics.

If We Were To Continue This Expansion Of The Golden Rectangle Then We Would Arrive At A Series
Of Values Representing The Increasing Values Of The Diagonals In An Expanding Golden Triangle.

1.90211, 3.07768, 4.97979, 8.05747, 13.03726, 21.09473, 34.13199, 55.22673, 89.35872,
144.5854

When Rounded These Values Are The Same As The Fibonacci Series.

1,1,2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4180, 6763,
10943, 17706, 28648

Each higher number in the series is approximately 1.618034 times the value of the pre-
vious number.

LUCAS NUMBER SERIES

This number series is derived by taking one as the origin and increasing each succes-
sive number by PHI 1.618034

1, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236, 6.854, 11.09, 17.95, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199

322, 521, 843, 1364, 2207, 3571, 5778, 9348, 15125, 24473.

From 29 on I have rounded off each value. This series is popularly known as the
LUCAS series of numbers. Each number also holds a fixed relationship to the Fibonac-
ci series of numbers, if you multiply a Fibonacci number by 1.382 it will equal the next
Lucas number that falls between the Fibonacci series.

When this series is reversed to project a contraction we get the values :- 1 divided by
PHI 1.618034 then the result divided by PHI and so forth.

1, 618, .382, .236, .146

These ratios are natural divisions of PHI and hold an extremely important place in the
methods of analysis to follow.

Phi expanded by a factor of Phi

1.618*1.618 = 2.618

2.618*1.618 = 4.236 [1.618*1.618* 1.618]
4.236*1.618 = 6.854 [1.618*1.618*1.618* 1.618]
Phi contracted by a factor of Phi

1.618/1.618 = 1.000

1.000/1.618 = 0.618

0.618/1.618 = 0.382 [0.618*0.618]

0.382/1.618 = 0.236 {[0.618*0.618*0.618]

0.236/1.618 = 0.146  [0.618*0.618*0.618*0.618]

These expansions and contractions hold the secret to the natural progressions of the Logarithmic
spiral.

POWERS OF NUMBERS

Besides the Fibonacci and Lucas series of numbers we have natural squarings of num-
bers. The most important are squarings of prime numbers. Often these squarings will
form common numbers calculated from other base numbers, these numbers are more
significant as they can be derived from several sources. Without covering every num-
ber under the Sun one should place emphasis on the following numbers.

Powers of 3, 7 and 12 are very important numbers to watch.

76 + 89 = 165(3x55) 89+ 123=212 = 123 + 144 = 267(3x89) 144+ 199 =343[7*3]
199 + 233 = 432(3x144) 233+322=555 et cetera.

GILMORE NUMBER SERIES

These ratios of the Fibonacci series are very strong numbers to watch for the
reason being that in the construction of a triangle that unfolds in the ratios of 1.272
(root Phi) and 1.414 (root 2) a relationship can often be found in the markets.

21* 1.272 = 27 (33)

34* 1.272 = 43 (3~3*1.618)

55* 1.272 = 70 (3 *3*2.618)

89* 1.272 = 113

144*1.272 = 183 (1/2 circle)

233*1.272 = 296 (144+ 144+8 and 183*1.618)

377*1.272 = 480 (1 1/3 circle)

21* 1.414 = 30 (5*6)
34* 1.414 = 48 (8*6)
55* 1.414 = 78 (13*6)
89* 1.414 = 126 (21*6)
144*1.414 = 204 (34*6)
233*1.414 = 330 (55*6)

377*1.414 = 533 (89*6)

Another number that continually appears in markets for which I have no great founda-
tion for is 293, although 293*2 equals 586 (590 days is 1.618 years).

This number can be constructed thus:- 144 * root 2 + 89

SUMMARY

All of the Time and Price squaring procedures used in modern charting rely on the
geometric relationships of ancient mathematics. These relationships are an exact
science that has been passed down through the ages. Mathematics is not some modern
day fad or invention but a form for measuring precise relationships.

The science of mathematics is common the world over, it does not matter if you are a
Russian, Chinese, Japanese or Indian the same principles apply.

One strong arguement to explain why these formulae are so useful is the fact that they
form a common bond throughout the world.

Markets can expand in time and price relationships covered in this chapter and find
solid resistance or support at precise levels. To use these methods to advantage it is
simply a matter of recognizing their significance and acting accordingly, should other
important criteria exist at the time.

MAXIMIZING ANCIENT GEOMETRY

Modern charting, using all of the mathematical relationships of ancient geometry, al-
lows for the calculation of SUPPORT and RESISTANCE areas that may signal an im-
pending change in trend. By counting off time elapsed from major, intermediate and
minor swing points in markets a common bond between the ratios of moves will be
seen to exist. The more coincidences of clusters at a given future date and price will un-
doubtedly add more strength to each signal. Besides counting time and price we can
also have vibrations. Vibrations are total mathematical relationships of future moves to
past moves in both time and price, eg. the time or price of move is a 1, 1.414, 1.618 or
a2 multiple of the preceding move.

The more advanced methods for measuring wave form relationships are discussed in
later chapters. As we go on you will see examples that defy logical explanation.

Chp.2 Page. 21
ANCIENT GEOMETRY

Markets will form a character that almost mirrors the past, even if these relationships
at first seem difficult to identify, they exist. This is due to both the natural cycle of the
universe and the natural subconscious of the participants.

In nature, especially music, certain vibrations are pleasing to the ear. These vibrations
when explained using mathematical terms relate directly to ancient geometry. The
sacred roots of 1, 2, and 5 can be found to exist in all things. My research work using
these same ratios in markets has enlightened me to an approach of analysis that has
such accurate predictive qualities, it is second to none.

It is very important that you learn off by heart the relationships of ancient geometry
that bind together the square, circle and golden rectangle. Time is a wheel (circle), as
time unfolds it can be squared to the past in ancient geometric ratios to make accurate
predictions for future important time areas that may signal changes in trend.

3. IMPORTANT STATIC TIME ELEMENTS CAN
SIGNAL A CHANGE IN TREND

USING MATHEMATICAL TIME ELEMENTS

Technical analysis is the title given to the mathematical study of human behavior in
markets. If we accept the fact that market trend is precipitated by human endeavour
and weigh up the facts, we can see repetitive time price elements for trend changes in
markets, often these become habit forming.

By measuring the DURATION OF A TREND IN TIME FROM ITS ORIGIN we can
expect a change in trend to occur when a move has been in progress for 34, 55, 89,
144, 233, 377, 610, 987 trading or calendar days.

To a lesser degree but still very important time zones are 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521
trading or calendar days.

It is important to realize that if we are charting a commodity using only business days
and allowing gaps for public holidays we will have 262 bars per year. 262 is an expan-
sion of PHI. [PHI SQUARED (1.618034 X 1.618034 = 2.618034)]. Important times
to watch for a change in trend in trading days elapsed will be signaled at 61, 101, 161,
262 bars from the beginning of a major move. 61 trading days is approx. 89 calendar
days, 101 trading days is approx. 144 calendar days. 161 trading days is approx. 233
calendar days, a higher degree Fibonacci series number. A review of past markets will
highlight this fact.

The use of these times by chartists and analysts for timing trading entries and exits has
a profound effect on market action. ON LONG TERM WEEKLY AND MONTHLY
CHARTS THESE NUMBERS ALSO REPRESENT IMPORTANT AREAS FOR A
CHANGE IN TREND TO OCCUR. 144 WEEKS IS NEARLY 34 MONTHS AND
WILL OFTEN SIGNAL A MAJOR TREND CHANGE. AS YOU BECOME
FAMILIAR WITH THESE RATIOS IT WILL PAY TO INVESTIGATE THE
VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF MULTIPLES AND SQUARES AS THEY INTER
RELATE TO TIME IN WEEKS AND MONTHS.

Chp.3 Page. 23
STATIC TIME

For instance 3025 calendar days (552) is the equilavent of 432 weeks (3x144). 729
calendar days (9 *3) is equal to two years. 61.8 weeks is 432 days.

ANNUAL CARDINAL POINTS

Always be prepared for a change in trend occurring at the strong astrological cardinal
points. 0, 90, 180,270 DEGREES. MARCH 21ST, JUNE 21ST, SEPTEMBER 21ST
AND DECEMBER 21ST. If a current trend has been entrenched for 34, 55, 89, 144,
233, 288, 343, 377, 432 DAYS etc and one of these anniversaries falls on the above
dates a counter trend reaction is almost certain to occur. One could become rich fol-
lowing these signals alone.

CLUSTERS OF TIME

Working time forward from previous swing highs and lows in trading days, calendar
days, weeks and months will pinpoint clusters of time ratios that adhere to the num-
bers listed in chapter 2. When obvious clusters of important time elements exist
around future dates we should investigate market performance closely to evaluate the
possibility of a trend change coinciding with these clusters.

JUST RECENTLY THE AUSTRALIAN ALL ORDINARIES INDEX COMPLETED
THE FIFTH INTERMEDIATE WAVE OF PRIMARY WAVE FIVE ON THE 21ST
SEPTEMBER 1987, THE EXACT TIME FOR INTERMEDIATE WAVE FIVE FROM
THE INTERMEDIATE FOURTH WAVE LOW WAS 89 CALENDAR DAYS. SEP-
TEMBER 21ST WAS THE EQUINOX AND ALSO THE 56 YEAR (7x8) ANNIVER-
SARY FROM THE MAJOR LOW OF 1931. THE LAST WAVE UP NOT ONLY EX-
PANDED 33% IN VALUE BUT ALSO TRAVELLED 573 POINTS (just short of 4
times 144) THIS WAS ALSO THE EXACT RISE IN POINTS OF THE EXPANSION
FROM the 1974 bear market low to the 1980 high which signalled a correction of
40% in value through into 1982.

THE TIME FROM THE INTERMEDIATE WAVE 3 HIGH WAS 89 TRADING
DAYS, THE TOTAL TIME FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FINAL AD-
VANCE (PRIMARY WAVE 4) WAS 293 TRADING DAYS FROM LOW TO

Chp.3 Page. 24
STATIC TIME

HIGH. IN JUST A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH THE CRASH HAS RETRACED
1160 POINTS FOR A LOSS OF 50% IN VALUE FROM THE 2312 HIGH.

DIVISIONS OF A YEAR

Measure the time elapsed from major turning points in divisions and multiples of a
year. ANNIVERSARIES OF ONE YEAR ARE VERY STRONG FORCES FOR A
CHANGE IN TREND. 182 DAYS OR HALF A YEAR, 225 DAYS OR 61.8% (time of
a VENUS planetary year) OF A YEAR, 590 DAYS OR 161.8% OF A YEAR.

These times are very strong in marking a change to trend. You can use them in two
ways, count the time as a cycle ie, TOP to TOP or BOTTOM to BOTTOM or as a -
half cycle TOP to BOTTOM or BOTTOM to TOP.

Minor Trend Changes Are Likely To Occur At Intervals Of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 210,
240, 270, 300, 330 Calendar Days. These divisions mark 1/12ths of a year. Once a
pattern of turning points in a market is identified adhering to these times the future
becomes far more predictive.

in 1986 on September the 22nd (September 21st was a Sunday) the Gold
market made an expected high. (equinox 180 degrees)

This date coincided with the square of the June low of $287 (287x2 =574).

September 22nd 1986 was exactly 574 calendar days from the major low February
25th 1985.

- 574 was also very close to (4x144 =576).
The December contract high on September 22nd 1986 was $446. The low in 1985

on December gold was $301.50 and the market had risen $446-$301.50 = $144.50
(Fibonacci number 144)

STATIC TIME

The market had a fast fall over the next few days as traders sold off long positions.
By October the 6th the market had climbed back to $445 and was testing the pre-
vious top.

On October 8th on its fourth attempt to penetrate the double top of September
22nd the market continued a retracement that lasted 60 days and reduced the
December price $70 down to $376.50.

October 8th 1986 was exactly 1.618 years (590 days) from the major low on
February 25th 1985.

The newspapers probably gave some fundamental reason for this decline but lam
positive that it occurred purely by way of the natural actions of traders as price and
time squared in the natural sense to these vibrations. By using both price and time
squaring methods the dedicated analyst can make his fortune by patiently awaiting
signals of this dimension and entering the market at the precise time and price for a
change in trend.

4. STATIC PRICE INCREMENTS AND LEVELS FOR
SUPPORT & RESISTANCE AREAS

MATHEMATICAL PRICE ELEMENTS

The perspective of markets is clearly identified when charted. Charts have two axis,
these axes are the time scale and the price scale. In the geometry of markets each axis
is as important as the other. In the previous chapter we covered static time elements
that can signal a change in investor sentiment that leads to a change in the apparent
trend. To confirm our views on time we use price, the term that I will use will be time
and price "squaring". Squarings of time and price balance a third element known in
technical terms as space.

PRICE is the most natural measurement used by technical traders in determining sup-
port and resistance areas in markets. Few traders really appreciate the value of measur-
ing time, yet most have a knowledge of calculating price objectives.

If we refer to chapter 2 and the ancient geometry that gives us a basis of natural num-
bers we can apply these to increments of price movement as well as time.

FIBONACCI DEGREE PRICE RISES AND DECLINES

The first series of numbers to watch are price moves in ratios of the Fibonacci series.
If we investigate past markets we will find that trend changes regularly occur in
markets after a rise or fall in points coinciding with the Fibonacci series, ie 13, 21, 34,
55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610 et cetera.

The way we monitor these levels is to extend price values in Fibonacci degree up from
lows and down from highs. Clusters of price support and resistance levels will be clear-
ly identified.

On page 28, FIG 3.5 the lower chart demonstrates a price move of $233 from the Gold
low in February 1985 to the high of December 1987.

PRICE LEVELS OF FIBONACCI DEGREE

The power of these natural numbers seems to play an important part in the subcon-
scious actions of traders therefore it is important to watch for reversals of trend that
coincide with exact price levels on these numbers. IE, a trend could terminate at 55
points, 89 points, 144 points, 233 points, 377 points et cetera in actual price value.

LUCAS DEGREE PRICE RISES AND DECLINES

Using the same procedure as with Fibonacci price supports and resistances secondly
we monitor all levels from highs and lows in LUCAS degree numbers, ie 11, 18, 29, 47,
76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843 et cetera.

This chart of the December contract demonstrates a price rise of $199 from the

PRICE LEVELS OF LUCAS DEGREE

The same principle as mentioned above for Fibonacci price levels applies to Lucas

price levels.

STATIC PRICE

The upper chart FIG 3.4 on page 28 demonstrates this phenomena, two very sig-
nificant reversals to trend occurred at exact Lucas price levels, ie $322 and $521.

SQUARE OF 144

144 is psychologically one of the most important numbers to watch when working with
relationships of time and price, 144 relates to the harmonic of the speed of light. Price
moves of 72 (half 144) points, 144 points, 288 (2x144) points, 432 (3x144) points, 576
(4x144) points, 720 (5x144 and 2x360) points.

5 is a natural harmonic cycle and multiples thereof are equally as important ie, 10x144
= 1440, 15x 144 = 2160, 20x144 = 2880.

Price and time multiples of 144 in calendar days, trading days, weeks and months
should be measured off important swing highs and lows in markets for a possible guide
to a future trend reversal. Price levels in multiples of 144 points, ie $288, $432 et
cetera, should be monitored as possible natural support and resistance areas in
markets.

144 is of prime importance, not only is it a Fibonacci number but also the square of 12
(12x12 = 144). 360 divided by 2.5 (half a harmonic cycle) equals 144.

Squares of 144 are :- 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008, 1152, 1296, 1440, 1584, 1728,
1872, 2016, 2160, 2304, 2448, 2592, 2736, 2880, 3024(55x55).

Other important functions of 144 are :-
144 x 1.118 = 161 (PHI)

144 x 1.272 = 183 (half year in days)
144 x 1.414 = 204 (6x34)

144 x 1.618 = 233 (Fibonacci)

144 x 2.236 = 322 (Lucas)

144 x 3.236 = 466 (233 x 2)

SIMPLE SQUARINGS OF TIME AND PRICE

Time and price will square when, say, a market moves 89 points in 89 days or 144
points in 144 days. Both of these examples would be exactly square as units of price
equal units of time.

FIG 4.3. The following chart demonstates a major move in the Platinum market that
squared $432 rise in 432 days.

COMPLEX SQUARINGS OF TIME AND PRICE

Squarings of time and price often occur in a more complex relationship. For instance a
valid squaring could fall on any ratio that is related to the Golden Rectangle, Square
or Circle. Relationships of time that could balance price could be a 0.618 relationship,
a 1.414 (root 2) relationship or even a 1.272 (root Phi) relationship. These will be dis-
cussed in detail in future chapters. At the moment it is important to realize that a
move of 89 points in 144 days would signal a price move of 0.618 units of price to 1.00

Chp. 4 Page. 35
STATIC PRICE

unit of time. Similarly a price move of 144 points in 89 days would signal a 1.618
relationship of price to time. $233 in 34 weeks could signal a valid squaring of price
and time (in fact the June Comex Gold contract made a bear market rally from June
1982 until February 1983 that terminated on this exact ratio).

When price terminates a move on clusters of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, even on
squares or multiples of these numbers, a valid price level has been attained. Should
the time elements mentioned in chapter 3 coincide with this price level then a genuine
"squaring" of time and price has been witnessed.

USING STATIC PRICE ELEMENTS

The Gold market is one area that I have found to be very reliable in its reversal signals
often generated via the above methods. Some heavily traded stocks often move in
these relationships. The criteria for using these signals for trade timing should be that
the market is free trading (that means it must be free of governmental subsidies or in-
terference). The more diversified the participants and the greater the activity of
traders the more reliable these methods become.

Generally any free trading market be it a currency option, stock or commodity will
lend itself to these technical measurements.

Important price expansions or contractions should be measured up from lows of impor-
tance and down from highs of importance. Clusters of support and resistance should be
given priority for consideration when a time element of importance (clusters of time
forward from previous swing highs or lows in similar ratios) falls due.

Even though this chapter is not directed to time it is important to realize that as the fu-
ture unfolds time will be balanced by price. Sometimes trend changes will seem vague
in their relationships but later on some relationship will unfold to confirm what has
passed. By this statement I mean that it could happen that a bottom or top of a market
is reached in say 144 days or 233 days prior to an Equinox, Solstice, Apogee or
Perigee.*

By working backwards from the important cardinal points in a year other time ele-
ments will be present at major price levels using static price mathematics. An example
comes to mind on the All ordinaries index this year. February 10th, 1988 was a low
point (price bottomed at 1169.6) that signaled the lift off for the latest rally which has
so far seen a high of 1642. This was just 142 calendar days from the all time high of
1987 also 72 calendar days (half 144) and 47 trading days from a minor correction to
the great crash. February 10th /12th is also 144 days prior to the July 5th Apogee
(position of Earth in its annual orbit when velocity is at its slowest), February 11th was
also 233 days from the June 1987 Solstice.

AS ONE LEARNS MORE ABOUT THE NATURAL CYCLES OF NATURE THE
RATIOS AND NUMBERS PRODUCED FROM THE SQUARE, CIRCLE, AND
GOLDEN RECTANGLE WILL TAKE ON AN IMPORTANCE NOT FORMALLY
RECOGNIZED PREVIOUSLY. RESEARCH OF PAST MARKETS WILL CON-
FIRM THE REGULARITY OF TREND CHANGES OCCURRING AT TIME
AND PRICE SQUARINGS IN RATIOS OF ANCIENT GEOMETRY. TO SUC-
CEED IN USING THESE RATIOS ONE HAS TO DEVELOP A SENSE FOR

DYNAMIC PRICE LEVELS

5. DYNAMIC PRICE SUPPORTS AND RESISTANCES

This section covers the natural price barriers that markets encounter when in either
an uptrend or downtrend. The reason I have headed these supports and resistances as
DYNAMIC is because they are forces generated by previous market action. To
measure these forces requires using actual price movement and making calculations
based on the ratios found in the SQUARE, CIRCLE and GOLDEN RECTANGLE.

The most natural area of resistance or support encountered in price movement is at
the 100% level or half way levels of 100% divisions. If a market were to rise by 100%
in value most traders would recognize this fact and become reluctant purchasers, on
the same hand should a market fall in value by 100% it would be reduced to zero
value and could not decline further, should it fall in value by 50% then it would be half
the price and represent reasonable value to a purchaser.

Investor sentiment plays the major role in determining trend reversals in markets. The
psychology of traders follows a mathematical pattern, the important ratios handed
down through the ages and reflected in nature are the ratios of PHI and the SQUARE.

DOUBLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS

The first and most important level of resistance and support to become familiar with is
past market price levels. These levels are easily visible when charted. If one maintains
long term price charts for a commodity or stock these previous high and low points can
be easily monitored.

As a market approaches previous high points investor psychology changes, they fear
that prices have gone too high and stocks or commodities are no longer worth holding,
this precipitates selling. The further the distance between double tops the stronger the
psychological effect. Traders learn from the past and remember what happens when
markets rise too high in too short a time. When a market declines to a previous low
point the natural subconscious alerts investors to the possible value of buying, this ac-
tion supports any further decline.

Chp.5 Page. 39
DYNAMIC PRICE LEVELS

If time dictates a change in trend and the market is overbought or oversold at these
levels then a reaction to trend will be more certain.

The first chart below is of the Copper cycle between the high of 1980 and the high of
1987. The bear market decline was a fall of 62.5% in value in 123 weeks (LUCAS).
The initial reaction to this fall was a rise of 50% in value before declining once again
to test the lower end of the range. A double bottom was formed and a new bull market
was underway. After a dramatic rise in prices throughout 1987 the bull market expired
exactly on the 288 week time frame (2x144) from the low of 1982 forming a double top
with the 1980 high. The level reached in 1980 was $1.47 per pound, in 1987 price ter-
minated at $1.46 per pound. At the time market expectation was for much higher
prices to come. As you can see from the chart this did not eventuate and the correc-
tion to the rise was swift and devastating.

SUMMARY

There are many other important time elements to be considered for a change in trend,
but these are not common numbers and require calculations to be made over past
data. These are fully detailed in the pages ahead.

Free trading markets are heavily influenced by the power of technical traders. Techni-
cal traders are speculators who use mathematical concepts to guide their decision
making. At times when the signals are clearly strong enough they combine as a force
to turn even the strongest apparent trend. When these actions coincide with the
natural vibrations a market will react voilently allowing excellent opportunity from
which to profit.

For the best use of these time periods one should measure time from major swing
points and look to locate CLUSTERS of time zones that adhere to important numbers
be they daily, weekly or monthly periods.

Carefully watch the 90, 180, 270 and 360 degree points of a planetary year for major
trend reversals.

4. STATIC PRICE INCREMENTS AND LEVELS FOR
SUPPORT & RESISTANCE AREAS

MATHEMATICAL PRICE ELEMENTS

The perspective of markets is clearly identified when charted. Charts have two axis,
these axes are the time scale and the price scale. In the geometry of markets each axis
is as important as the other. In the previous chapter we covered static time elements
that can signal a change in investor sentiment that leads to a change in the apparent
trend. To confirm our views on time we use price, the term that I will use will be time
and price "squaring". Squarings of time and price balance a third element known in
technical terms as space.

PRICE is the most natural measurement used by technical traders in determining sup-
port and resistance areas in markets. Few traders really appreciate the value of measur-
ing time, yet most have a knowledge of calculating price objectives.

If we refer to chapter 2 and the ancient geometry that gives us a basis of natural num-
bers we can apply these to increments of price movement as well as time.

FIBONACCI DEGREE PRICE RISES AND DECLINES

The first series of numbers to watch are price moves in ratios of the Fibonacci series.
If we investigate past markets we will find that trend changes regularly occur in
markets after a rise or fall in points coinciding with the Fibonacci series, ie 13, 21, 34,
55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610 et cetera.

The way we monitor these levels is to extend price values in Fibonacci degree up from
lows and down from highs. Clusters of price support and resistance levels will be clear-
ly identified.

On page 28, FIG 3.5 the lower chart demonstrates a price move of $233 from the Gold
low in February 1985 to the high of December 1987.

PRICE LEVELS OF FIBONACCI DEGREE

The power of these natural numbers seems to play an important part in the subcon-
scious actions of traders therefore it is important to watch for reversals of trend that
coincide with exact price levels on these numbers. IE, a trend could terminate at 55
points, 89 points, 144 points, 233 points, 377 points et cetera in actual price value.

LUCAS DEGREE PRICE RISES AND DECLINES

Using the same procedure as with Fibonacci price supports and resistances secondly
we monitor all levels from highs and lows in LUCAS degree numbers, ie 11, 18, 29, 47,
76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843 et cetera.

The upper chart FIG 3.4 on page 28 demonstrates this phenomena, two very sig-
nificant reversals to trend occurred at exact Lucas price levels, ie $322 and $521.

SQUARE OF 144

144 is psychologically one of the most important numbers to watch when working with
relationships of time and price, 144 relates to the harmonic of the speed of light. Price
moves of 72 (half 144) points, 144 points, 288 (2x144) points, 432 (3x144) points, 576
(4x144) points, 720 (5x144 and 2x360) points.

5 is a natural harmonic cycle and multiples thereof are equally as important ie, 10x144
= 1440, 15x 144 = 2160, 20x144 = 2880.

Price and time multiples of 144 in calendar days, trading days, weeks and months
should be measured off important swing highs and lows in markets for a possible guide
to a future trend reversal. Price levels in multiples of 144 points, ie $288, $432 et
cetera, should be monitored as possible natural support and resistance areas in
markets.

144 is of prime importance, not only is it a Fibonacci number but also the square of 12
(12x12 = 144). 360 divided by 2.5 (half a harmonic cycle) equals 144.

Squares of 144 are :- 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008, 1152, 1296, 1440, 1584, 1728,
1872, 2016, 2160, 2304, 2448, 2592, 2736, 2880, 3024(55x55).

Other important functions of 144 are :-
144 x 1.118 = 161 (PHI)

144 x 1.272 = 183 (half year in days)
144 x 1.414 = 204 (6x34)

144 x 1.618 = 233 (Fibonacci)

144 x 2.236 = 322 (Lucas)

144 x 3.236 = 466 (233 x 2)

SIMPLE SQUARINGS OF TIME AND PRICE

Time and price will square when, say, a market moves 89 points in 89 days or 144
points in 144 days. Both of these examples would be exactly square as units of price
equal units of time.

FIG 4.3. The following chart demonstates a major move in the Platinum market that

COMPLEX SQUARINGS OF TIME AND PRICE

Squarings of time and price often occur in a more complex relationship. For instance a
valid squaring could fall on any ratio that is related to the Golden Rectangle, Square
or Circle. Relationships of time that could balance price could be a 0.618 relationship,
a 1.414 (root 2) relationship or even a 1.272 (root Phi) relationship. These will be dis-
cussed in detail in future chapters. At the moment it is important to realize that a
move of 89 points in 144 days would signal a price move of 0.618 units of price to 1.00

Chp. 4 Page. 35
STATIC PRICE

unit of time. Similarly a price move of 144 points in 89 days would signal a 1.618
relationship of price to time. $233 in 34 weeks could signal a valid squaring of price
and time (in fact the June Comex Gold contract made a bear market rally from June
1982 until February 1983 that terminated on this exact ratio).

When price terminates a move on clusters of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, even on
squares or multiples of these numbers, a valid price level has been attained. Should
the time elements mentioned in chapter 3 coincide with this price level then a genuine
"squaring" of time and price has been witnessed.

USING STATIC PRICE ELEMENTS

The Gold market is one area that I have found to be very reliable in its reversal signals
often generated via the above methods. Some heavily traded stocks often move in
these relationships. The criteria for using these signals for trade timing should be that
the market is free trading (that means it must be free of governmental subsidies or in-
terference). The more diversified the participants and the greater the activity of
traders the more reliable these methods become.

Generally any free trading market be it a currency option, stock or commodity will
lend itself to these technical measurements.

Important price expansions or contractions should be measured up from lows of impor-
tance and down from highs of importance. Clusters of support and resistance should be
given priority for consideration when a time element of importance (clusters of time
forward from previous swing highs or lows in similar ratios) falls due.

Even though this chapter is not directed to time it is important to realize that as the fu-
ture unfolds time will be balanced by price. Sometimes trend changes will seem vague
in their relationships but later on some relationship will unfold to confirm what has
passed. By this statement I mean that it could happen that a bottom or top of a market
is reached in say 144 days or 233 days prior to an Equinox, Solstice, Apogee or
Perigee.*

By working backwards from the important cardinal points in a year other time ele-
ments will be present at major price levels using static price mathematics. An example
comes to mind on the All ordinaries index this year. February 10th, 1988 was a low
point (price bottomed at 1169.6) that signaled the lift off for the latest rally which has
so far seen a high of 1642. This was just 142 calendar days from the all time high of
1987 also 72 calendar days (half 144) and 47 trading days from a minor correction to
the great crash. February 10th /12th is also 144 days prior to the July 5th Apogee
(position of Earth in its annual orbit when velocity is at its slowest), February 11th was
also 233 days from the June 1987 Solstice.

5. DYNAMIC PRICE SUPPORTS AND RESISTANCES

This section covers the natural price barriers that markets encounter when in either
an uptrend or downtrend. The reason I have headed these supports and resistances as
DYNAMIC is because they are forces generated by previous market action. To
measure these forces requires using actual price movement and making calculations
based on the ratios found in the SQUARE, CIRCLE and GOLDEN RECTANGLE.

The most natural area of resistance or support encountered in price movement is at
the 100% level or half way levels of 100% divisions. If a market were to rise by 100%
in value most traders would recognize this fact and become reluctant purchasers, on
the same hand should a market fall in value by 100% it would be reduced to zero
value and could not decline further, should it fall in value by 50% then it would be half
the price and represent reasonable value to a purchaser.

Investor sentiment plays the major role in determining trend reversals in markets. The
psychology of traders follows a mathematical pattern, the important ratios handed
down through the ages and reflected in nature are the ratios of PHI and the SQUARE.

DOUBLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS

The first and most important level of resistance and support to become familiar with is
past market price levels. These levels are easily visible when charted. If one maintains
long term price charts for a commodity or stock these previous high and low points can
be easily monitored.

As a market approaches previous high points investor psychology changes, they fear
that prices have gone too high and stocks or commodities are no longer worth holding,
this precipitates selling. The further the distance between double tops the stronger the
psychological effect. Traders learn from the past and remember what happens when
markets rise too high in too short a time. When a market declines to a previous low
point the natural subconscious alerts investors to the possible value of buying, this ac-
tion supports any further decline.

Chp.5 Page. 39
DYNAMIC PRICE LEVELS

If time dictates a change in trend and the market is overbought or oversold at these
levels then a reaction to trend will be more certain.

The first chart below is of the Copper cycle between the high of 1980 and the high of
1987. The bear market decline was a fall of 62.5% in value in 123 weeks (LUCAS).
The initial reaction to this fall was a rise of 50% in value before declining once again
to test the lower end of the range. A double bottom was formed and a new bull market
was underway. After a dramatic rise in prices throughout 1987 the bull market expired
exactly on the 288 week time frame (2x144) from the low of 1982 forming a double top
with the 1980 high. The level reached in 1980 was $1.47 per pound, in 1987 price ter-
minated at $1.46 per pound. At the time market expectation was for much higher
prices to come. As you can see from the chart this did not eventuate and the correc-
tion to the rise was swift and devastating.

formed was within 0.08 of a cent of the 1983 high. Top tick was 14.39 cents per pound,
1 tick off 10 times 144 and the time between the two tops was 267 weeks (3x89)

ship of the first advance from 1985 to the double bottom before the final advance
resumed. These two periods balanced out at exactly 383 trading days. (maybe it’s a
coincidence but 383 ties in with the 38.2 ratio from PHI). The price at the double bot-
tom was 5.77 cents (4x144) which means that the rise up to 14.39 cents was 6 times

100% RISE IN VALUE FROM A LOW PRICE

This, in Gann terms, is the 1st square of the low price, one of the most significant
areas for a reaction to trend. It may not necessarily mean that the trend will not con-
tinue at a later date but in the short term these areas are a logical psychological force
to be overcome before further advances can be made. Once breached these 100%
levels can act as support. I have included a chart of an Australian stock MOUNT ISA
MINES to demonstrate this characteristic of markets. A major low was formed at 99
cents in July 1986, the third wave advance from this low terminated at $2.98 exactly
200% up and on the 2nd square of resistance from the low. A 50% retracement of the
total rise from 99 cents came quickly, this coincided with the 100% square of the low
price. The market then resumed its upward trend which terminated at $3.80, the pre-
vious highest high on MOUNT ISA had been at $3.78 back in 1980, a double top
ended any further advances in that cycle. The bear market decline terminated at the
66.6% discount level to the new high. Two time elements are shown on this weekly
chart, others will be shown in later chapters as more confirming methods of market
geometry are demonstrated.

DECLINE IN VALUE FROM A HIGH PRICE

In Gann terms this level marks the half square of the high, the mid point between the
high price and zero value. Once a market declines to a level of 50% of its highest price
a reaction will be almost certain, depending on the fundamental reasons for the
decline and the duration often a violent reaction will ensue as investors scramble to
pick up the newly identified bargain. The more psychologically oversold a market is
the greater will be the upward reaction. Again this may only signal an intermediate in-
terruption to the bearish longer term trend.

All Ordinaries Index CRASH OF 1987 - Support was met at the 50% level of the all
time high. From a high of 2312 on the 21st September 1987 the market declined down
to 1149.2 on the 11th November 1987 a fall of 1163 points. 2312 less 50% equals 1156.
1156 divided by 144 equals 8. On the day of the low of 1149.2 the market sentiment
was one of complete despair, investor confidence was in tatters. On the evening of
November 11th, 1987 I attended a meeting of about 30 technical traders, when it was
my time to speak I outlined all of the reasons I had for buying the market that day just
prior to the close, not one other person in the room had bought that day. Had it not

been for my knowledge of investor psychology and market geometry I guess I would
have lacked the confidence to act against the prevailing trend.

Another example of a 50% decline in value of the previous highest level attained is
demonstrated by this chart of the Swiss Franc against the US$. This decline unfolded
over a seven year period and was a major bear market decline, nevertheless support
was reached within points of the 50% value of the 1978 high..

61.8% to 66.6% DECLINE IN VALUE FROM A HIGH PRICE

This area is the most significant support for the termination of a major long term bear
market. I am including numerous examples of this phenomena to demonstrate the im-
portance of these levels.

The first example is the chart of the Australian dollar versus the US$. The Australian
dollar began a decline in 1974 from a high of $1.495 to the US$, in 1986 some 12 years
(144 months) later a bottom was made at $0.572 to the US$. $1.495 less 61.8% equals
$0.571 another amazing example of the ratio of PHI at work in the geometry of

markets. If this chart had been plotted as a reciprocal ie with the A$ expressed as a fac-
tor of the US$ then the value in 1974 of a US$ in AUD$ would have been $0.668, in
1986 at the low it would have required $1.748 to buy one US$. $0.668 increased in
value by 1.618 (phi) equals $1.748 QED.

FIG 5.6 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SQUARING 1974 HIGH BY 61.8%.

This currency moves in fibonacci ratios of all types, for instance the decline from the
1978 high of 118.9 to the history low at 57.1 in 1986 was a fall of exactly 61.8 cents.

A rise in value of 61.8% from the low of 57.1 would give a target of 91.93 cents, also a
61.8% retracement of the 1974-1986 range (149.5 - 57.1) [61.8% of 92.4 equals 57.1]
lies at 114.2, a 38.2% retracement [38.2% of 92.4 equals 35.3] and lies at 92.4 cents.

At the low of 57.1 one US dollar bought AUD$ 1.75, on the 8th December 1988, 864
calendar days [6 times 144] from the 1986 low the market made an intermediate rever-
sal after trading to a high of 88.33, that high represented US$ 1.00 to AUD$ 1.132 or
61.8 cents less than AUD$ 1.75 at its 1986 high point.

The next example is the major Australian share market decline of 1970 to 1974, The
adjusted All Ordinaries index made a high of 448 in 1970, by the low of September
30th, 1974 the price had reduced itself to 173.5 points. 448 less 61.8% equals 171.14
points, this is another incidence of PHI relationships and the geometry of markets at
work.

SUMMARY OF DYNAMIC PRICE LEVELS

The important message in this chapter is to remember the primary technical areas for
major support and resistance.

Double tops and bottoms over long periods of time.
Levels of 50%, 61.8% and 66.6% declines in value from an all time high

100% SQUARES OF LOWS as major price resistance.

Always think in percentage terms when looking for a major support or resistance level
that will echo in a new long term trend.

6. SQUARING PRICE FOR LOCATION OF FUTURE
SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE ZONES

The Gann technique for squaring price adopts three approaches :-
1. SQUARING A PRICE RANGE

2. SQUARING A LOW PRICE

3. SQUARING A HIGH PRICE

SQUARING PRICE

The term squaring relates to calculating percentage increases of a price by values of
half or 100% increments. Increments of each square in 1/8th values as well as 1/3rds
are important for minor divisions. Fibonacci degree increments are also important.
The major levels are 50% and 100%.

As an example the squares of 144 are :-

ist Square = 288 (144 + 144)

2nd Square = 432 (144 + [2*144])
3rd Square = 576 (144 + [3*144])
4th Square = 720 (144 + [4*144])
5th Square = 864 (144 + [5*144])
6th Square = 1008 (144+ [6*144])
7th Square = 1152 (144 + [7*144])
8th Square = 1296 (144 + [8*144])

and so forth

Chp.6 Page. 49
SQUARING PRICE

Square divisions from zero of 144 would be :

1/8 Square = 18 (144*1/8
1/4 Square = 36 = (144*1/4
1/3 Square = 48 = (144*1/3
3/8 Square = 54 =(144*3/8
1/2 Square = 72 (144*1/2
5/8 Square = 90 = (144*5/8
2/3 Square = 96 = (144*2/3)
3/4 Square = 108 (144*3/4)
7/8 Square = 126 (144*7/8)
1st Square = 144

SQUARING PRICE

SQUARING A PRICE RANGE

The term squaring refers to divisions of 100% of something, in the case of price squar-
ing we divide the price to be squared into naturally square divisions. The main level
of resistance or support will be reached when a move either progresses another 100%
or falls 100%.

To square out a range we first have to define that range.

The first thing we need to find out for any stock or commodity option is the HISTORY
HIGH AND THE HISTORY LOW. THIS IS THE PRIMARY RANGE TO BE
SQUARED.

THE SQUARE OF THE HISTORY RANGE AND THE DIVISIONS OF THAT SQUARE WILL BE THE
NATURAL LEVELS FOR FUTURE SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE.

The history high and history low will provide the means to calculate these levels most
clearly. Any future price action that contains itself within this range will be subject to
these technical levels of support and resistance.

The purpose of squaring a range is to find the mathematical levels of previous price
movements that will cause a natural resistance or support to current price action.

To appreciate why range squaring is so important in market analysis it helps to under-
stand the mentality of traders. In any bull move many participants will be caught
buying right at the top; as prices decline in a bear move professional traders will buy
more to average out the price of their holdings. When a new uptrend or correction
reaches the level of their averaged out price they will liquidate part of their holdings.
This action will increase selling pressure and temporarily halt any future gains.

Markets move in four phases, accumulation, advance, distribution, decline. Accumula-
tion occurs before any sustained advance. Distribution occurs before any sustained
decline.

Accumulation and distribution phases occur when the smart money players have a shift
in sentiment about the future direction of prices. Advances come when demand over-
balances supply, declines naturally occur because of oversupply.

EXAMPLE OF RANGE SQUARING USING SOYBEANS

The history high so far registered by the July beans was 1290 cents per bushel, trading
there on the Sth June 1973, the known low price is 44 cents per bushel registered on
the 28th December 1932.

Using this historic range we can calculate the natural levels that technical traders
should use in the future to locate possible support and resistance zones.

If at a future time the price rises above the HISTORY HIGH of 1290 cents we can
make projections for future resistance based on this range, by simply expanding the
range upwards in square divisions.

The following calculations would be applicable :-

The range is 1246 (1290 less 44)

25% of 1246 = 311.5 ADDED TO THE HIGH 1290 1601.5

33% of 1246 = 411.2 ADDED TO THE HIGH 1290 1701.2

50% of 1246 = 623.0 ADDED TO THE HIGH 1290 = 1913.0

and so forth .....

Square divisions of a range that will offer price resistance or support do not necessarily
only rely on the history high and history low. Shorter term support and resistances
may be established using more recent extremes in range. In fact from an everyday
trading point of view these are the levels that are most useful. It pays to always
watch the longer term range levels when they are close to the price action in an ex-
tended move of a long bull or bear campaign.

Chp.6 Page. 53
SQUARING PRICE

DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TOPS These levels are 100% levels of a previous range, the
further apart in time that they occur the more important is the technical significance.

SHORT TERM DOUBLE TOPS OR BOTTOMS often form prior to a major trend
change, the market first makes a high or low point, then it will make a fast correction.
An advance or decline in a very short time period back to the previous high or low
price that fails to penetrate these shorter term levels will form a double top or bottom.
If a time period coincides with this type of exhaustion phase, then a major turning
point in trend is indicated. Always be on your guard for double tops or bottoms as
these are one of the best entry points for trading purposes. The most significant techni-
cal indication is for a market to fail on it’s 4th attempt to rise above or fall below a pre-
vious turning point. THESE ARE EXCEPTIONAL AREAS TO ENTER A TRADE
AND ACCUMULATE FAST PROFITS.

MARKET CORRECTIONS

Corrections to major and minor moves often retrace previous ranges in square degree
or Phi degree exactly to the tick. For instance, common retracements in a correction
are 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 66.6% of the preceding range. A more detailed study of
retracements and projections of range is covered in a later chapter.

SQUARING A LOW PRICE

As previously mentioned a square of a price is a 100% increase or decrease. In the
case of a low this extends to future squares of the original low, ie 100% 200% 300%
400% 500% etc,.

First we start with the history low of any particular stock or commodity option, for our
example we will use Soybeans once again.

The square of the low price 44 cents will offer resistance to future rises in the follow-
ing increments.

44 increased by 25% = 55
44 increased by 33% = 585
44 increased by 50% = 66
44 increased by 66% = 73

SQUARING A HIGH PRICE

Squaring a high price to find support levels is a common practice. I have found that
on occasions it pays to look at squares of previous highs expanded vertically when find-
ing resistance levels for markets traveling upwards into previously uncharted territory.

If we square a high price down then we can only use one square, if a price were to fall
100% then it would be worthless, this would be a very rare occurrence.

Squaring a high price is a very simple exercise as you can see. Oddly enough as we ap-
proach the lower end of this squaring we find a link between 144 and the values.

ANY MAJOR TURNING POINT

It will always pay to square all recent major lows and highs as a quide to future
support and resistance levels. These fevels, depending upon their sig-

nificance will act as future support or resistance in the eyes of technical
traders. If any other strong technical influences apply at_a time the market
trades at these levels , then a reversal in trend is highly likely.

DYNAMIC TIME VIBRATIONS

7. DYNAMIC TIME SUPPORTS AND RESISTANCES

This section covers the natural time barriers exerted by previous market action. The
time axis for any commodity or stock is even more important to market analysis than
the price axis. The measurements we use to calculate these dynamic forces are again
the ratios found in the SQUARE, CIRCLE, GOLDEN RECTANGLE and the
GREAT PYRAMID of GIZA.

PREVIOUS MAJOR RANGE TIMES

The most natural area for a change in trend is when a previous major range time has
been balanced in time. It is fairly simple to understand that the trend forces at work in
markets take time to dissipate. In science we are taught that for every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction. Any shock to a market will generate a force that com-
pels the participants to act in a certain way. Depending upon the mass psychology of
traders, price will often trend in an upward or downward direction for long periods of
time. Along the way there will be corrections to this trend as minor forces interact to
the current long term force in motion. The further away in time we go from a major
shock then, theoretically, the less force it has as time has allowed the traders room to
erase this past from their memory. In practice, however, the mass psychology that
drives prices up and down in varying cycles has some natural basis. Natural forces in
markets can be measured, and the accuracy of these measurements is often amazingly
precise for predicting days on which a future change to the current trend will occur.

The most important range time to start measuring future vibrations off is the last
major trend. The term vibrations has been selected to cover the varying measurements
one can use to calculate future areas where a change in trend will be most likely. If
One studies price movement, one will see that in each major trend a series of market
movements go together to form the complete move. Ralph Elliott earlier this century
discovered that bull markets generally expand in five wave movements and bear
markets unfold in threes. Elliott states in his theory that waves of price action will be
related in both time amplitude and price amplitude. Another discovery made by stu-
dents of the Elliott wave theory was that bull markets generally last 1.618 (PHI) times
the time of bear markets. This means that bear markets are generally 61.8% of the

Chp. 7 Page. 59
DYNAMIC TIME VIBRATIONS

time amplitude of bull markets. A bull market as a general rule is not complete until it
has formed five waves, three impulse waves in the upward direction of the trend each
separated by a corrective phase before the next advance. The original principle applies
to each of the impulse waves, they will also unfold in five wave movements. Correc-
tions in a bull market will form three waves, each minor wave will form three waves.
In a bear market the three waves will be two down broken by a corrective phase. The
two impulse waves down will contain five waves and the correction will contain three
waves.

For our purposes if we use the basic tenets of the Elliott wave theory to identify impor-
tant wave movements in markets we have a sound basis from which to measure time.

The most important ranges from which to measure time will be :-

1. A completed bull and bear phase.
2. A completed bull phase.

3. A completed bear phase.

The major time vibrations for a newcomer to this theory too watch for counter trend
reactions are the 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 100% and 161.8% as these are the strongest for-
ces at work in the natural sense.

Other vibration ratios and how to use them are detailed later but first let us look at a few
examples of time forward from previous market cycles in the NYCSE MARCH SUGAR contract.
Below is a table of swing highs and lows going back from more recent times to the major cycle
highs and lows of years past. The following table is an example of the detailed information that 1

COMPLETED BULL AND BEAR CYCLES

A completed market cycle is the bull and bear phase. Over the years a series of these
cycles will join together to form larger cycles. The time vibrations forward from lesser
degree cycles and larger degree cycles will relate in mathematically degree. When
vibrations from a series of cycles, be they long term or short term, fall together they
can signal a natural area for a trend reversal.

FIG 7.1 THE LONG TERM MONTHLY CHART OF MARCH NYCSE SUGAR
#11. This shows how time of the major cycle LOW to LOW, (which included an amaz-
ing bull market lifting price from a low of 1.23 cents to a high of 66 cents per pound
then back to 7 cents over a period of 10 years), set in motion a vibration that clearly
signaled two future highs and lows. The second bull market range time adhered to the
Elliott wave theory teachings as it was 1.618 times the length of the next major bear
market phase. As an aside it is interesting to note that the low price of 1.23 cents was
100% square of the all time history low for sugar registered on the 21st June 1932 at
0.61 of a cent. Also the time in days from the 1.23 cent low of January 3rd, 1967 to the
high 66 cents, November 21st, 1974 was exactly 2880 days (20 times the square of 144).

BULL MARKET CYCLE

A bull market cycle could be defined as any market cycle when prices trend upwards
to higher values over long durations of time. To measure the time vibrations of a bull
market phase it is simply a matter of measuring ratios of time forward from the con-
clusion of the bull market phase.

The chart below (FIG 7.2) of March Sugar shows graphically how to do this. One
should not become over anxious that each vibration forward will cause a violent reac-
tion to trend. Sometimes the market will be in a state of equilibrium and little
volatility will result. Obviously when the market has been in a volatile medium greater
reactions can be expected. Another problem arises when we inspect this chart and that
is forecasting whether to expect a high or low on future time vibrations. From past ex-
perience I have found great difficulty predicting highs and lows too far distant into the
future. However, with a thorough understanding of how to combine all of the time and
price methods to form an analysis this problem is alleviated to some degree. Be careful
not to go out on a limb in your expectations, just remember that a counter trend reac-
tion often occurs on these important vibration times.

BEAR MARKET CYCLE

Vibrations of a bear market cycle are measured forward in time in the same ratios as
demonstrated above. This chart (FIG 7.3) of March Sugar shows two reactions to trend
on the 50% and 61.8% vibration markers. In this particular instance the bull market
that followed this bear market was 61.8% in time duration of the previous bear
market. In Elliott wave terms this bull market could be construed as a bear market
rally since the time duration was less than the underlying forces that dragged the
market down from its previous high price. In the grand cycle of events this bull market
was merely a corrective phase to the previous major cycle, under Elliott wave theory
this bull market could be called a B wave cycle.

USING RANGE VIBRATION TIMES FOR TRADING SIGNALS

Range vibrations of cycles, half cycles, one and one half cycles can be extended for-
ward in the major ratios 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 100% and 161.8%. The important areas
for counter trend reactions will be highlighted by clusters of time vibrations falling
together. These areas are the natural vibration elements that abound in all free trading
markets. Carry forward vibration times of selected ranges on monthly, weekly and daily
charts. Follow the basic tenets of the Elliott wave theory of markets as a guide to the
type of counter trend reaction to expect on the time clusters. If a major price squaring
occurs on these time elements then both time and price amplitude has been satisfied
and a major change in trend is indicated.

The high on March Sugar of 45.50 cents in November 1980 occurred on two major
cycle vibrations mentioned above. At the same time a range retracement of 66% price
of the previous bear market decline was fulfilled. Another time period of importance
was 72 months (half 144) from the all time high of 66 cents when the double top was
formed and the next bear market got underway. This top was also 165 months (3x55)
from the low of 1.23 cents. You can clearly count five waves up from the low which fur-
ther helps confirm ones suspicions that a major change in trend would be forthcoming.

RANGE VIBRATIONS IN INTERMEDIATE WAVES

Once all primary cycle vibrations have been calculated and extended forward for fu-
ture recognition we can move down a wave degree and plot intermediate wave vibra-
tions in the same manner as with primary cycles.

The same mathematical ratios apply throughout the complete process for establishing
vibration time clusters of previous cycles and half cycles. Measurements are taken
from previous intermediate swing highs and lows, high to high, low to low and low to
high. When more than two intermediate time vibrations cluster on a future date a reac-
tion to trend is indicated for this time. Once again to confirm a price and time squar-
ing is taking place a price objective should be obvious, ie a retracement or projection
of a previous market move of primary or intermediate degree should be present to sig-
nal a counter trend reaction. Price retracements or projections in the same wave ratio
as time offer the most convincing squarings, yet is is not mandatory that time and price
actually fall in the same identical ratios only that they fall on the common ratios put
forward in this text.

DAILY CHART FOR ACCURACY OF TIME MEASUREMENT

DAILY March Sugar NYCSE #11 (FIG 7.6) is an example of the same vibrations
38.2% and 61.8% in trading days. The time of the range being projected forward was
518 trading days (3 days less than 521 Lucas). The 61.8% vibration calculated at
518*61.8% equals 320 (322 = Lucas) trading days. Exactly 320 trading days forward of
the June 1985 low a support in the market was reached as the chart shows. This was
the low of 2nd October 1986 at 5.75 cents (4x144).

The vibration of 38.2% of the same range signaled the high of 10th April 1986 at 9.64
cents. This was 1 day off the required calculation 518*38.2% equals 198 trading days as
the high fell 199 (Lucas) trading days from the June 1985 low of 3.34 cents.

CONFIRMING ORIGINAL FINDINGS

RANGE FROM APRIL 30th, 1986 HIGH 9.67 cents TO LOW OCTOBER 2nd, 1986
5.75 cents.

Time squared on a 50% vibration of the previous intermediate bull market range,
namely the time from the 20th June 1985 low of 3.34 to the high 9.67 on 30th April
1986 which was 213 trading days. Time in trading days down to 5.75 was 107. As seen
above there were now two important vibrations that squared out on the same day, 2nd
October 1986.

In terms of price retracement of the previous upmove from 3.34 to 9.67, which equaled
633 ticks, a 61.8% price decline of this range calculated out to 633*61.8% equals 391
ticks. 9.67 less 3.91 equals 5.76, the low made on the dual time vibration was 5.75
which I would consider close enough to confirm my belief in the geometry of markets
as a science rather than an art.

ALTERNATIVE CONFIRMATIONS OF TIME SQUARINGS

The last chart (FIG 7.8), to conclude this section, is further proof of the geometry of
time vibration. The time in trading days from the May 1983 high of 14.48 cents to the
top of 30th April 1986 (incidentally this was the day of the Chenoble disaster news
being released and one would have expected prices to rise rather than decline on the
fundamental news) was 731. [ 731 * .618 * .618 * .618 * .618] equals 107, .618 raised
to the fourth power equals 0.146, 107 divided by 731 equals a 0.146 time vibration.

The low of 2nd October, 1986 at 5.75 cents basis March futures came in on the 107th
trading day measured from the April 30th high.

THE BOTTOM LINE ON RANGE VIBRATION

The bottom line of this section is to leave one in no doubt as to the value of time vibra-
tion in markets. The technical signals using these methods to pinpoint the 2nd October
1986 low at 5.75 cents are too overwhelming simply to be a random coincidence. One
can only conclude that a natural force is at work in the subconscious minds of traders,
these forces dictate market patterns that once set in motion will reverberate well into
the future until some major shock overrides their strength and new patterns begin to
evolve from the new factors present in the particular market being followed.

The clearest indication to trade these signals is when both time and price relate
geometrically; the market can be seen to be overbought or oversold and volatility dic-
tates good risk reward ratios. Fortune will favor the astute analyst who is prepared
to put his money up against the prevailing opinion that usually abounds at such turn-
ing points in trend.

Extreme importance should be placed on vibrations of 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 100% and
161.8% in both time and price.

Vibrations of 127.3% (root Phi), 141.4% (root 2), 173.2% (root 3), 200% (root 4) and
223.6% (root 5) are also very important.

Begin by tracking the first group and then see how many cross confirmations you can
relate to the second group.

At every major swing high or low relationships will exist in the primary waves, inter-
mediate waves, the minor degree waves and the very short term waves.

8. CHART SCALING OF TIME AND PRICE

This chapter deals with the complexities of chart scaling. It is quite important that
chart scales are understood prior to explaining Gann techniques for squaring price to
time and Gann support and resistance angles.

Geometric charting implies what it means, the price scale must relate to the time scale
in a ratio of the square, circle or golden rectangle if we are to transpose one axis to the
other and expect measurements to hold a strict relationship.

1 UNIT OF PRICE EQUALS 1 UNIT OF TIME SCALE

FIG 8.1 Is an example of a daily 1 by 1 chart scaling using the Comex Gold market as
an example.

Time is the axis that is fixed. Time is uniform, we can plot 1 hour, 1 day, 1 trading day,
1 week, 1 month or even 1 year. Nothing arbitrary, time is a fact of life. Price on the
other hand sometimes causes a dilemma. Before we look at various forms of squaring
price scales to time scales we should understand that the correct scale of price to time
can only be 1 unit of time to 1 unit of price. This means we must plot 1 unit of price
to 1 hour, 1 day, 1 trading day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year if we are to work in
SQUARE ratios.

ALTERNATIVE PRICE TO TIME SCALES

Throughout the ages man has endeavored to introduce standard measurement scales
to all things. Land areas have been scaled in square feet, square meters, acres, hec-
tares, square miles and square kilometers. Produce has been measured in ounces,
pounds, kilograms, tonnes, tons, bushels and so forth. Financial instruments are
measured in rates of change to a contract specification. Time is fixed by the move-
ment of the Sun yet price is completely variable.

Chp.8 Page. 72
GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

Each commodity has its own psychological price unit that balances units of time. Over
years these units can change as inflation and deflation of price unfolds with economic
developments.

As a guide I am going to detail in this section the scales of price to time that I have
found useful for a base value of 1 unit of price to 1 day of time. These relationships
could change in the future yet at the moment they are appropriate to this subject.

STOCKS AND SHARES SCALING

Depending upon the trading value of each individual stock or share we can experiment
with the base value to associate with time.

Stocks trading below $ 5.00 should use 1 cent per day.

Stocks trading between $ 5.00 and $ 10.00 should use 2 cents per day.
Stocks trading between $ 10.00 and $25.00 should use 5 cents per day.
Stocks trading between $ 25.00 and $50.00 should use 10 cents per day.

Stocks trading between $ 50.00 and $100.00 should use 20 cents per day.

As price value increases so does the theoretical psychological unit of measurement
that controls volatility. Personal experimentation with individual stocks, based on
volatility, will help guide you to the correct value for your analysis. Price scale is an ar-
bitrary value, from time to time certain markets will require changes. It is better to un-
derstand this fact beforehand so that disasters in judgment can be avoided.

Chp.8 Page. 74
GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

BEST ADVICE ON SCALING

At all times where possible select a base unit that is a round number psychologically,
ie .01, .10, 1, 10, 100, 1000 et cetera.) ONE UNIT will always perform better than
variations of this theme although at times it is necessary to expand scales. A later chap-
ter on commodity vibration will certainly alleviate the major problems one has wres-
tling with this dilemma.

DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY CHARTS

The practice of scaling each different time frame back to a base price unit of ONE is a
strict prerequisite in geometric charting. At times the scale will be far too small for the
plotted price series, when this occurs instead of increasing the base unit to an arbitrary
figure we can increase the base unit used on the daily chart by square ratios so that
price remains in perspective.

If a unit price used on a daily chart causes the weekly chart to become unmanageable,
ie price scale is far to sensitive to time scale, then a ratio in square degree should be
used on the weekly and vice versa the monthly price series. By this I mean that assum-
ing a scale of say $ 1.00 per day is being used as a base price to time scale on a daily
chart then ratios of $1.00 x2 = $2.00 or $1.00 x4 = $4.00 or $1.00 x8 = $8.00 should
be used for price to time on the weekly or monthly charts so that price scales remain
square.

You may not appreciate the reason for this at this moment yet once we have discussed
geometric angles used by Gann traders and technicians it will become quite clear. The
same principle applies when we have longer periods of data to plot and it is physically
impossible to maintain the base scale due to vertical limitations of our worksheet.

GEOMETRIC ANGLES OF SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

Once a suitable scale of price to time is found for a commodity or stock we can use
geometric angles to monitor time and price squarings in the ratios of the square, circle
and golden rectangle.

Geometric angles take on the following form when drawn on a 1 unit to 1 day chart.
A 1 unit of price to one unit of time is a 45 degree angle (1/8 of the circle of 360 degrees).

A 2 units per day angle is an angle of 63.5 degrees, this angle will square price to time in a ratio of 2
to 1. Eg, a move of 288 points in the angle will take 144 days.

A half unit of price to 1 day angle is approximately 26.5 degrees, this angle will square price to time
in a ratio of 1 to 2. eg, a move of 72 points will take 144 days.

The Gann philosophy of markets assumes that the 1 by 1 angle is the strongest guide
to trend strength or weakness. Correctly drawn on a geometric chart this is the 45 de-
gree angle. When a 45 degree angle is drawn down from a major swing high and the
market trades below this resistance it is said to be in a weak state. Conversely a 1 by 1

Chp.8 Page. 76
GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

or 45 degree angle drawn up from a major swing low will signal the state of the trend,
if the market is trading above this angle it is said to be in a strong state, if below this
angle then it is in a weak state. At times reversals to trend will be signaled at points
along these angles, these are generally at times when significant time periods from
swing highs or lows elapse, ie. at say 144 points in 144 days, 89 points in 89 days.

ANGLE INTERSECTIONS AND TIME SQUARING

If the 1x1, 2x1 and 1x2 angles are drawn geometrically down from swing highs and up
from swing lows they will square time at their crossings. One Gann practice for measur-
ing time forward for a trend reaction area is this principle.

If each swing high and low of major degree on a geometric chart is related in some
strict mathematical degree, and the chart scaling reflects this, then it would be true
that intersections of these angles would signal a third dimensional squaring. This prac-
tice is known as the squaring of space. These intersections of angles do not necessarily

Chp.8 Page. 77
GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

need to coincide with price, yet their crossings are an important area in time as they
form triangular relationships with the past at these points.

FIG 8.6 BROKEN HILL PROPRIETORY LIMITED scaled at 2 cents per trading day demonstrates
some relationships that can be found in markets using geometric angles.

MY BEST GUIDE TO THE USE OF GEOMETRIC ANGLES

The 1x1, 2x1 and 1x2 angles are best used as a guide to trend strength, occasionally they will pin-
point a turn in trend by forming a support or resistance on the actual high or low point reached
before the trend reversal. This will only occur should an exact squaring take place in the ratios of a
square. More often than not time and price squarings will be made in other degrees, ie price 61.8%
and time 50%, price 50% and time 38.2% et cetera.

Third dimensional squarings of space seem to be one of the best uses for these angles so it is impor-
tant to keep up your geometric angles from major swing points and be aware of their specific use in
your analysis. As you become proficient at utilizing all of the various geometric techniques in this text
you will understand how each technique is also a variation of another method.

GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

ALTERNATIVE ANGLES USED BY TECHNICIANS

Students of time and price squaring have devised many alternatives to the original
theories passed down by the masters of geometrical charting over this century. Angles
of 1.5 units of price to time are considered important technical ratios to monitor, 1
unit of price to 1.5 units of time is also considered a strong geometric relationship.

FIG 8.7 of the GOLD chart below gives a quick pictorial view of the angles that can be
used by chartists to determine strength of trend. One must bear in mind that with the
volatility of markets today there is an increased need to find levels of price that are
within daily ranges to gauge support and resistance zones.

1.618 AND 0.618 ANGLES OF PRICE TO TIME

Technicians that work in Fibonacci degree also use 1.618 x 1 price to time, 0.618 x 1
price to time angles. These angles are in the ratios of the Golden rectangle. On oc-
casions, as price and time vibrations revolve through the geometric circle, these angles
pinpoint ratios of price moves in Fibonacci degree. For example, a 1.618 price to time
angle will measure units of price such as 144 points travelled in 89 days, a 0.618 angle
will measure the reverse such as 89 points travelled in 144 days. Any angle drawn in
strict mathematical degree to the square, circle and golden rectangle is important from
a technicians point of view. If price squares time in an ancient geometric relationship it
is important. Angles are purely a way of stating the obvious. If we wish to keep one
step ahead of the unfolding price patterns we need to be aware of all the techniques
that we can employ.

per day and 0.618 per day to measure future moves for support and resistance.

PERCENTAGE OF A PRICE SQUARING TO TIME

As an adjunct to this method of measuring price to time squarings it would not be fair
to dismiss percentage price moves from a high price or low price as insignificant. In
some commodity and stock indices, averages are used to determine the value for the
index. In cases such as these it is fair to assume that averages of previous price could
be just as important to geometric relationships as points moved. In effect this means
that some price series can be geometrically charted in percentages. This would at first
seem totally impossible, yet we do not need to concern ourselves with the problems of
day to day entries that do not reflect the true exchange value given out. All we need to
do is monitor price rises and declines in percentage increments of previous important
swing highs and lows. Examples of major bear markets terminating at 50%, 61.8 and
66.6% decreases in value to their highs has been demonstrated in an earlier chapter. ~
What was not demonstrated was the relationship of price decline per day, week or
month in percentage terms.

To begin with this type of analysis one should use an index of a group of stocks or a
group of commodities.

For my purpose of demonstration I am going to cite a major move in the ALL
ORDINARIES INDEX (The Australian equivalent to the American Standard and
Poors 500 stock index) over the past two years.

Firstly the ALL ORDINARIES made a low on 28th JULY 1986 at 1094.1 points, in El-
liott wave terms now that we have experienced the crash of 1987 we can safely label
this low as a primary wave 4. This means that from an analysis viewpoint any time
squarings emanating from this low are strictly written in stone. On 21st September
1987 the ALL ORDINARIES index made its final high prior to the October crash at
2312.4 this was exactly 293 trading days and 420 calendar days from this low, the rise in
points from 1094.1 was (2312.4 less 1094.1) 1218.3 points. In percentage terms the rise
from 1094.1 to 2312.4 fulfilled a mathematical ratio often overlooked by students of
this science 1.118 (the section of the square that goes to make the golden rectangle, ie.
0.5 plus 1.118 equals 1.618). 1094.1 increased in value by 111.8% equals 2317.3, The
exact rise in the ALL ORDINARIES was 111.4% very close indeed. Another factor
that should not be overlooked was the 2 x 610 (Fibonacci multiple) present at the com-
pleted primary wave 5 advance. The price rise fell only 1.7 points short, the 5th inter-
mediate wave fell 2 points short of 576 points (4x144) taking 89 calendar days exactly,
and terminated on the September equinox at the time of a solar eclipse.

Chp. 8 Page. 81
GEOMETRIC CHARTS AND ANGLES

From a time perspective the move up from 1094.1 to 2312.4 was 293 trading days (144
* root 2 plus 89) if we divide 111.8% by 293 we get an average rise of 0.38157% per
day.

This means that an angle drawn up from the 1094.1 low at 0.38157 % of 1094.1 per day
intersected the high price made on the 21st September 1987 at 2312.4. Obviously to fol-
low these particular calculations requires some thinking, I would rather think than suf-
fer when it comes to market analysis and trading decisions. INCASE ANYONE HAS
MISSED THE POINT .382 IS .618 SQUARED.

Of course before arriving at this brilliant deduction one would have looked at
numerous other methods to pick the top of the bull market, I have detailed many
other relationships that squared price and time at the 2312.4 top in other sections of
this text.

How do we plot angles off swing highs and lows in percentage degree? This is easy as
1% substitutes for $1.00, 1 point et cetera. In this instance 1094.1 reduced to 1%
equals 10.941 points per day. By emitting our Fibonacci angles up and extending our
times forward we would have been prepared to recognize a geometric squaring of
price and time at the 2312.4 top.

9. FUTURE TIME SQUARINGS OF PRICE

SQUARING PRICE UNITS FORWARD IN TIME FOR FUTURE AREAS LIKELY TO SIGNAL A
COUNTER TREND REACTION IS A METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED AND TAUGHT BY THE GRAND
MASTER OF GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS W.D. GANN.

There are three techniques used for this methodology:-

SQUARING A LOW PRICE IN TIME TO THE FUTURE

SQUARING A HIGH PRICE IN TIME TO THE FUTURE

SQUARING A PRICE RANGE IN TIME TO THE FUTURE

Since it is possible to transpose price units to future time units it is also possible to
reverse the procedure and transpose time units back into future price. An example of
this technique is demonstrated at the end of this chapter. (See FIG 9.6)

SQUARING A RANGE TIME TO FUTURE PRICE

SQUARING A LOW PRICE IN TIME

On a chart scaled at 1 unit of price to 1 unit of time, if we were to draw a square start-
ing with a vertical line up from zero to the low price to be squared, then horizontally
forward the identical units of time, then vertically back down to zero a square will be
formed. The forward vertical line will measure the first square of time of the low price.

A low price of $ 100 will square out in time 100 days forward from the date of the low.
On a weekly chart it will be 100 weeks on a monthly chart 100 months.

These squares of time to price are very important areas for Gann theory traders to
look for and expect a counter trend reaction to price movement. It does not stop
here, as depending upon the significance of the low (Major, History or Minor), their in-
fluence can predominate over many future squares as well as divisions of squares.

The strongest points to watch are at the 50% and 100% levels.

Chp.9 Page. 83
GANN TIME SQUARINGS OF PRICE

Next watch 33.3%, 66.6%, then 25%, 75%. Minor divisions such as one eighth could
be of importance. 141.4%, 161.8% and 223.6% of major squarings should also be
noted.

These technical methods are particularly useful for agricultural products such as
Soybeans, Wheat and Corn. They also help to confirm time squarings within the Gold
complex.

SQUARE OF THE 1982 LOW IN THE STANDARD & POORS 500

This weekly chart (FIG 9.2) is an example of Gann at work. The low of 102.41
registered on the S&P 500 cash back in 1982, worked forward, signaled many a sig-
nificant trend reversal on this weekly chart. Of course research will show that other
relevant technical information coincided with the major turning points. Squaring of
major lows in both time and price has proven to be a powerful technical tool for the
students of geometric charting.

SQUARING A HIGH PRICE IN TIME

On a chart scaled at 1 unit of price to 1 unit of time if we were to draw a square start-

forward the identical units of time, then vertically back down to zero, a square will be
formed. The forward vertical line will measure the first square in time units of the
high price.

A high price of $ 144 would square out time 144 days forward from the date of the
high. Ona weekly chart it will be 144 weeks on a monthly chart 144 months.

The strongest levels are at 25%, 33.3%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 66.6%, 75%, 100%,

GANN TIME SQUARINGS OF PRICE

SQUARING A PRICE RANGE IN TIME

As with squaring lows and highs in time we measure forward in units of price trans-
lated to time units. So we do the same when squaring a price range in time. First we
measure the units moved from either a low to a high or a high to a low and then we
calculate forward from the turning point of that range, squares of that previous move.

For this example | have used the price range from the high 196.25 and low 100.25 used in the first
two examples of squaring a low and a high price. The geometric relationship formed from the high to
the low is a right angled triangle. The vertical axis is price in this case 96 cents (196.25 less 100.25)
the horizontal axis is time in this case 107 months. The hypotenuse of the triangle formed by this
range is 144 units if we are using a 1x1 scale of price to time.

You may already be thinking that I have made liberal use of the number 144 in the
text so far. The obvious reason is that I consider 144 the strongest static number one
can relate to. In fact if you were to only trade when a vibration squared in 144 relation-
ships you would make a fortune. Any geometric vibration in a market that contains 144
is confirming the existence of natural law at work. 96 by the way is exactly 66.66% of
144, 108 is 75% of 144.

Chp.9 Page. 87
GANN TIME SQUARINGS OF PRICE

The two price measurements that are transposed to time and measured forward into
the future are the vertical range 96 cents and the hypotenuse calculation 144. On this
example I have only used 100% squares for ease of explanation, I also included the
100% anniversaries of the time of the range 107 months to show how each method of
squaring range can be worked forward.

FIG 9.5 This chart of Corn also demonstrates the price squarings in 100% increments of each axis of
the triangle formed by the geometric range.

Just for the record, the ail time high on this Corn contract was 400 cents which was reached in Oc-
tober 1974. From the methods of price squaring discussed to date this high fell on the 300% square
of the low 100.25 cents (100.25 plus 3x100.25 equals 401 cents), also another geometric relationship
with the previous bear market range of 96 cents was evident ( 96 by PI (3.141593 x 96 equals
301.5)). If you were to add 301.5 to the low of 100.25 where the 96 cent bear market decline ter-
minated you would square price exactly to the 400 cent all time high.

GANN TIME SQUARINGS OF PRICE

SQUARING A RANGE TIME TO A FUTURE PRICE

If a move from a high to low or a low to high of major degree has occurred, then to
Square out the time duration to future price we translate time units to price units and
add or subtract the value to the last turning price of the range.

The NYCSE SUGAR example below shows a range in time of 155 days converted to 155 tics and
added to the low price to calculate squarings in this fashion. {t is important to realize that these
relationships can repeat whilst time is still working out the first square. { feel happier using these
methods when they coincide with other calculations such as vibration angles and retracement levels.
This sugar chart nevertheless shows an accuracy for this technique that defies explanation using
"standard" charting methods.

USE OF THESE METHODS

As a guide to the effective use of these methods it will pay only to use highs or lows
that are higher or lower than the current wave of prices. Major market turning points
have an enduring effect on markets whilst the price is contained within that range.
Some knowledge of the Elliott Wave Principle will help define ranges into Cycle,
Primary, Intermediate and Minor degree and give a good guide to the influence that
specific turning points may have in the future.

A combination of time clusters coming from numerous squarings of lows and highs at
a future time will signal a stronger geometric influence for a change to the current
trend.

10. RATIO ANALYSIS OF PRICE RETRACEMENTS
AND PRICE PROJECTIONS

In this chapter we will cover the most important price range projection and retrace-
ment levels needed to be monitored for market support and resistance. This section
only deals with the price axis and is a more detailed explanation of range squaring
covered in chapter 6.

When price is plotted geometrically on a two dimensional chart it will be seen to move
in waves, as these waves unfold they are telling us a story. We know from experience
that the driving force behind any market is the balance between buyers and sellers,
when nobody is prepared to sell prices will rise and when everybody wishes to sell
prices will fall. Under normal trading conditions price will move in four stages, ac-
cumulation, advance, distribution, decline. At times the advances and declines will
overreact to the generally held view of what the fair price should be. These periods of
extreme are naturally caused by the mass psychological habits of market participants
and are commonly referred to as periods of fear and greed. Human nature, being
what it is, tries in many ways to justify why a market price is at a certain level yet in
the end supply and demand rules the day as prices retrace previous advances or

declines looking for support or resistance levels where the market can once again find
a logical balance.

Changes in economic patterns can produce extended moves in price, both up and
down in value. These periods are referred to as bull and bear markets. In a bull
market prices will advance and decline from a stable area in stages; as a bull move
progresses the retracements to advances will diminish in degree. A detailed descrip-
tion to this phenomena can be found in the works of R.N. Elliott. A fully fledged bull
market will normally contain three major advances interrupted by two adjustment
periods where prices retrace part of the previous advance wave. Retracements to ad-
vances can be measured with a great degree of accuracy as they are working to some
natural law. As a guide the first wave of a new bull market will normally be retraced at
least 50% and often 61.8% for a wave two. The third wave which is often the longest

PRICE RETRACEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS

in a bull market extends above the high price of the first wave and terminates at a
level in relationship to the first wave advance. Several common levels for a third wave
top are 61.8% of the first wave advance added to the high of the first wave, 100% of
wave one added to the wave one high and 161.8% of wave one added to the wave one
high. As the third wave reaches its peak distribution begins as the players who gained
from the long advance start to take profits, generally the mood is still optimistic and
declines are usually limited to between 14.6% and 38.2% of the third wave advance.
Fourth wave adjustments often unfold as triangles and the pattern of price adjustments
on a chart can give one a guide as to the extent of the fifth wave that has yet to unfold.
In a bull market third wave, new buyers are progressively entering the market and
volume is increasing, during a fourth wave the late comers see the adjustment as good
value compared to the established trend. By the time the fifth wave begins to unfold
old buyers, who were smart enough to have participated in the bull market so far, have
distributed their stocks to the latecomers and the market forces are being driven by
greedy uneducated traders. Fifth waves can have two characteristics, they can be wild
affairs that take the market to new extremes and cause even the most rational traders
to re-enter as buyers close to the top, or they can be very short lived upmoves that rise
only slightly above the third wave top. Bull markets generally terminate at levels that
relate to previous major low prices (see chapter 4) or projection squares of earlier
major ranges. Price levels for a resistance top can be easily calculated in advance, as
we approach these areas we monitor the risk, if the risk is real we take evasive action.

PRICE PROJECTION EXAMPLES IN BULL MARKETS

FIG 10.1 SYDNEY SHARE PRICE INDEX

Although this chart is of the last bull market advance from July 1986 to September
1987 of a 5 year bull market the wave tops terminated extremely close to ideal ratios
of the first wave price advance. The wave top labeled (1) reached a high of 1385 after
advancing from a low of 1058 (1385 less 1058 equals 327). 327 points was incidentally
only 5 points greater than the Lucas ratio 322. The wave top labeled (3) terminated at
1906 for a net increase from the low 1058 of 848. 848 less 327 was 521 (Another Lucas
number exactly) the net advance above the wave (1) high. 521 is precisely 1.618 times
322 which means that the wave (3) high terminated at roughly a projection of 1.618
times the wave (1) advance. Observation of this chart also shows a correction between
the wave (1) high and the wave (3) high occurring when the advance reached the
61.8% projection level of wave (1).

The correction from the wave (3) high terminated very close to the 100% projection
level of wave (1).

FIG 10.1 - SYDNEY SHARE PRICE INDEX - FINAL ADVANCE BEFORE THE 1987 CRASH.

If projéctio.. levels of waves from lows to highs can be used to anticipate new highs it
must follow that, if retracements to these price advances fall in precise mathematical

degree to natural law, then projections from lows to lows can be used to project future
highs.

FIG 10.2 SYDNEY SHARE PRICE INDEX

This chart is of the same time period as Fig 10.1. The all time high on this index fell at
2387.5 on October 2nd, 1987. From a base of 1058 the overall rise was 1330 points.
The wave labeled (4) terminated at 1723 a drop of 183 points from the wave (3) high
of 1906 (earlier I demonstrated that 183 was a root PHI relationship of 144 ie 144 *
1.272 equals 183 and is very important). The net ground gained from the 1058 low to
the 1723 wave (4) low was 665 points (666 is the number of man and holds an impor-
tant meaning in the study of numerology). Forgetting numerology for a minute and
sticking with basic mathematics, the advance from the wave (4) low traced out a 100%
price advance to the high of 2387.5 to terminate wave (5) and end this amazing bull
market.

Wave (1) related to wave (3), wave (4) related to wave (5), the overall advance from
the low 1058 traced out a geometric pattern based on the square and the golden rec-
tangle.

This chart graphically illustrates the relationships that can unfold in a long protracted
price advance. Across the lower scale wave points are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The price at
0 was $301.50, tops 1 ($357.00), 2 ($392.00), 3 ($446.00) and 4 ($501.00). The first ad-
vance terminated at $357 a move of $55.50.

$55.50 by 0.618 added to $357.00 equaled $390.30
$55.50 by 1.618 added to $357.00 equaled $446.80

$55.50 by 2.618 added to $357.00 equaled $502.30

All of these price levels were met within $2.00 before subsequent reversals in trend,
naturally projections taken from each advance top related in lesser degree ratios of Phi
as the expansion continued. One would have to seriously question the random walk
theory in markets after reviewing this price action. As it turned out, the expansion also

followed the Fibonacci and Lucas series in dollar value which made it even more con-

The wave advance from $301.50 to $357 was $55.50 in 23 days, the high was made on
the equinox of March 20th. The first decline was exactly $23 in five days which squared
the range time, a counter trend rally of $20 over two days failed to get back to the
high. Over the next seven days a further decline of $21 broke just below the first cor-
rection indicating lower prices to come. After rallying back another $20 over the next
12 days the market failed to go above the first reaction high indicating once again

lower prices to come. The next low at $322.80 squared time in two ways (1); 47 days is
a Lucas ratio, (2); 47 days was twice (200%) the time of the 23 day wave in the first ad-
vance. MAY 6th is also 45 degrees on the circle of 1 year from the March equinox.
Price squared a 61.8% retracement of the advance from $301.5 to $357. The fall in
price was $34.20 a Fibonacci multiple. The market then rallied $19.50 over the next 8
days. Recognizing this opportunity would have been worth a tidy profit.

In this chart I have used some Elliott wave labels to identify the corrective phases from
the $357 high. The price decline from the B wave high down to 3 was $31.20, 61.8% of
this is $19.30, $342.30 less $322.80 is $19.50 giving the wave 3-4 a 61.8% relationship
with B-3.

The high of $342.30 was made exactly 55 days from the $357 high giving a Fibonacci
ratio and a squaring of the price range from $301.50 to $357.

Wave C = $319 MAY 28th, 1985

Wave C of (2) on this chart was 69 days from the $357 top labeled (1), this was a 3 times multiple of
the 23 days rise. The ratio of price (1) to 4 was 38.2% of the decline from (1) to C. The decline from

4 to C was $23.30, 30 cents greater than (1) to A. Time of B to C was 62 days and a decline of $35.

Wave D = $339 JUNE 18th, 1985

Wave D rose $20 in 21 days. This wave alternated with wave B which also was $20. Wave D ter-
minated 90 days from the $357 wave (1) high, both 89 and 90 are important ratios of time.

Wave E for (2) = $315.50 JULY 2nd, 1985
Wave E fell $23.50 to complete a 75% retracement of the rise from $301.50 to $357 [Wave (1)].
Wave (2) contained 9 minor waves for a total decline of $41.50 in 104 days. Three waves equaled

each other at $23 to $23.50, five waves equaled each other at $19.50 to $21. The longest wave of
$30.20 was the 3rd wave of C, as expected under Elliott wave rules.

FIG 10.7 WAVE STRUCTURE UP TO $392 HIGH 16th JANUARY 1986

The main technical feature here was the expansion of wave (1) by 61.8% to arrive at
the $392 target price. Time in days from the start at $301.50 was 325 days (a few days
off 322 Lucas). The correction that immediately followed this high retraced 50% of the
rise from $301.50 before halting. You will notice that this correction unfolded in five
waves, a very bearish scenario. The third wave as usual was the longest and strongest
wave. Time between the $357 high and the $350.20 high was balanced at the $392 high.
Another interesting relationship between the high of $357 to the $315.50 low ($41.50)
and the high of $350.20 to the high of $392 ($41.80) becomes apparent with a little ex-
ploration. Everywhere we look we keep finding repetitive ratios in the total wave struc-
ture so far. Will this continue in the future?

This chart is a good example of how time overrides price in many instances. After the
first two minor waves from the $392 high unfolded in perfect ratios of time and price a
consolidation period set in that followed time rather than price for the next several
counter trend reactions. Time ratios in degrees of Phi of the first corrective wave

projected forward signaled numerous swing points during the consolidation phase.

FIG 10.9 WAVE STRUCTURE $301.50 TO $447.70

This chart should reinforce the concept of price relationships in wave structures. Most
of the major ratios have already been detailed, the only one I wish to point out here is
the retracement from the $446.50 high back to $376.50 ($70.00). The price advance up
to $446.50 from $301.50 expanded $145, as a ratio of the overall advance $70 did not
appear to satisfy a satisfactory level although $70 is [ $55 * 1.272 (root Phi)]. $55 as a
ratio of $144 is 38.2% therefore $70 interlinks somehow. As it turned out the total
ground gained from $301.50 to the low of $376.50 was $75. $75 * 1.666 equals $125,
$376.50 plus $125 equals $501.50 which was near enough the high of April 27th, 1987
at $501.

Using projections and retracements of previous ranges to gauge support and resistance
levels in geometric markets is quite simple. If a market turns at these levels and an im-
_ portant time ratio of some other wave structure concurs, a change in the current trend
should last for a while. Depending on the severity of the price and time signals and the
prevailing psychological factors present at the time, an astute experienced analyst can
evaluate profit making strategies.

PROJECTIONS OF 38.2% 61.8% 100% 161.8% and 261.8%

Following range retracement and projection levels

To remain abreast of important price retracement and projection levels of previous
ranges one should maintain long term weekly charts and mark out the important price
levels that could square price in the future.

Start with the history high to history low range.
Then the latest primary high to primary low range.

Next use the latest intermediate high to low range as this is normally the most impor-
tant unless a major change of trend has occurred.

In minor waves follow the equality of waves and how they relate to the overall struc-
ture.

Watch for triangular formations as these could signal trading opportunities. Triangles
generally form in fourth waves, this means one more impulse wave then a complete
change in trend.

VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

11. GEOMETRIC VIBRATION ANGLES

This chapter should clear up any misunderstandings regarding the geometric ratios
used to find technical support and resistance put forward in this text to date.

VIBRATION

Vibration is the key to the universe, all matter emits a vibration. Even though we can-
not see it, it is there. The human heart vibrates at around 70 beats per minute, if ex- —
cited these vibrations increase, as things settle down to normal the vibration decreases,
when we sleep the heart rate reduces. Each vibration fulfills a cycle and then adjusts
its momentum into another phase. This phenomena continues unabated throughout
our lives and follows a natural pattern. Markets vibrate up and down in the same man-
ner, continually increasing and decreasing their vibration rate. These vibrations are a
function of ever changing factors to do with supply, demand and speculator interest.

W.D. Gann used an arbitrary value of 1 to 1 to measure the vibration of price against
time. This is merely a guide to the overall concept of vibration as vibration is not static
in markets. Vibration of markets is a function of the players. These players fight a bat-
tle with each other and a markets vibration rate either increases or decreases depend-
ing upon the intensity of interest.

As a trend in a market progresses the vibration rate should increase until such time as
the driving force exhausts itself, once this occurs a counter trend move will evolve,
generally at the same vibration or intensity that led it into the situation of exhaustion.
Nature adjusts to its mistakes in an unforgivable way.

DISCOVERING MARKET VIBRATION

When I first began squaring price and time I would draw my daily gold chart on a box
scale of 10 cents per day. After some time it was becoming unmanageable and I had
to change the scale to gain any perspective of the price movement against time. The

Chp. 11 Page. 105
VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

scales being used by Gann traders went through an upheaval after the 1980 bull
market. When I asked my friend Steve Barrett how he coped with the scaling on his
daily, weekly and monthly charts his answer was a little vague so J realized he was wres-
tling with this same problem. Each chart had its own specific problem, WHAT WAS
THE CORRECT VIBRATION RATE TO USE FOR THE 45 degree angle? This was
even more of a problem when plotting the All Ordinaries Index which now had a
range of 800 points and was rising.

COMMODITY VIBRATION

Commodity vibration is the term used to describe the rate of price increase or
decrease per day, week or month between two extreme points.

Some analysts I have met talk of commodity vibration numbers, by deduction I see
they are talking about specific cycles observed as being regular. These are not vibra-
tions as they are static in value.

FIG 11.1 DEMONSTRATES HOW EACH NEW WAVE IN AN ADVANCING MARKET GROWS IN ITS IN-
TENSITY OF VIBRATION.

Chp. 11 Page. 106
VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

Extreme market turning points for measuring vibration could be a history high and his-
tory low, major bull market top to the next major low, minor top to next minor low
etc.,

If the vibration of a commodity was changing with each cycle then it seemed to me
that I must change my 45 degree angles after each move if I wished to keep in tune
with the market. This meant rescaling my charts after each major move. Taking this
concept one step further meant adjusting angles to suit even the shorter term vibra-
tions.

CALCULATING A VIBRATION RATE.

Geometric vibration angles are the true reflection of previous price ranges squared to
time and price.

The vibration of a price move can be calculated by dividing the points travelled in that
move by the time taken to complete that move.

Example of the calculation required when a price rise of say $144 occurs in a market
trend over a period of say 233 days.

144 divided by 233 equals 0.618

This means that the average vibration for the completed move was $0.618 per day.

In Fig 11.1 of the All Ordinaries Index, the vibration angle of the total move from the
1974 low to the 1987 high squared out at 3.15938 points per week, This can be read
out from the Box(GN). This value holds a mathematical property often overlooked by
students of geometric charting.

Root 2 (1.414) multiplied by root 5 (2.236) equals 3.162 QED

Also PI which is 3.1417 came extremely close to this vibration.

TIME OF THIS RANGE WAS 677 WEEKS - POINTS RISEN 1974-87 EQUALED
2138.9 (89x 24 = 2136).

Chp. 11 Page. 107
VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

DISPLAYING A COMMODITY VIBRATION GEOMETRICALLY

Once the vibration of a trend is established we can then represent this vibration as the
diagonal of a square, ie the vibration rate becomes the true 1x1 unit of price to time
and the 45 degree angle of that square.

This 1x1 vibration angle can now be represented in degrees of the square, circle and
golden rectangle as a guide to future market strength or weakness.

FIG 11.2 VIBRATION OF A MOVE REPRESENTED AS THE DIAGONAL OF A SQUARE

This chart is a little more descriptive of these methods. The corrective wave has been
squared to price and time. The vibration of this move is read off the scale/bar at
6.75652 unit per day, hardly anything like 1 2 4 or 8 units per day that a standard
geometric chart would use. This means that the 45 degree angle is vibrating at 6.75652
and that the next wave needs to remain above the 45 degree angle if it is to signal
strength. At present the bullish trend is in a touch and go position as the market is
trading just on the primary 1x1 angle. There is good reason for this as at the last high
both time and price were overbalanced by a larger degree vibration.

Chp. 11 Page. 108
VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

If a trend is intact then the next impulse phase will increase its vibration, however,
should the future vibration wain, then it will signal an end to the longer term trend in
progress. This is generally a sign distribution is taking place.

1x1 vibration angles have a particular purpose for determining the future trend whilst
prices remain in a counter trending move from the squared range.

The first square has the most relevance in both time and price, as prices move along
they will form new important ranges that require new calculations to be made. Major
market shocks will have a more enduring effect on the future as they take longer to
erase from the memory.

Range vibrations should be calculated for all important market moves. These
originate from the range of the history high to the history low down to the most recent
minor range of significance.

An understanding of the Elliott Wave Principle is very important when it comes to
selecting ranges for future vibration calculations, be they minor, intermediate, primary
or cycle vibrations.

If we wish to represent a support or resistance angle of vibration that geometrically re-
lates to both price and time of a past range in other degrees such as the golden rec-
tangle, it is only a matter of manipulative mathematics. The 1x1 angle of the squared
range is multiplied by the desired factor.

Using the same range illustrated in Fig 11.2, where the 1x1 angle was calculated at
6.7565 points per day, a quick calculation of the 1.618 vibration would be 6.7565 *
1.618 or 10.9352 points per day. Similarly a 0.618 vibration of the same 1x1 would be
6.7565 * 0.618 or 4.1755 points per day.

Strangely enough I can remember from an earlier chart presented on page 82 in chap-
ter 8 where the vibration of the overall move from the 1986 low to the 1987 high of
this same index had a similar vibration to the 0.618 angle ratio just calculated. This
move lasted 293 days for a gain of 1218.3 points, a vibration of 4.158 points per day.

VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

Careful observation of this chart (Fig 11.4) will explain the significance of vibration
angles. Where they intersect they measure time. Markets vibrate on time and price
relationships to the past. This market turned on cue at 61.8% time 100% time 161.8%
time and 250% time. Look at the confusion during the first square. The last high of
several days ago turned on the 25% retracement of price as well as the 250% of time
vibration.

You may well be puzzled by Fig 11.4 as I did not square the chart range to the vibra-
tion value yet all of the angles have been drawn geometrically to represent their cor-
rect values. You can see that, just the same, they are all mathematically perfect. As
long as one understands the underlying principle behind commodity range vibrations .
geometric angles can be represented on any chart time price scale.

VIBRATIONS IN TRENDS

As a general rule the ratios of wave vibrations will hold a solid mathematical relation-
ship throughout a complete trend in the market, this includes both a related bull
market and bear market reaction.

Once a trend is evident one should take readings from the first advance or decline
and project these forward. Then vibrations of previous waves can be projected to con-
firm clusters where vibrations of price and time in past waves coincide with progres-
sive vibrations as time and price move through an unfolding geometric series of waves.

Whilst the market continues to unfold holding a pattern of past vibration tendencies
we can be sure that the mass psychology of the participants is relatively unchanged and
future trend will continue to advance or decline along the same relationships.

Note how vibration angles in PHI degrees projected from the first wave advance seem
to fit the future unfolding wave patterns, also how the time vibrations measure the
pulse of the future turning points.

This wave pattern is unfolding in a very corrective pattern as the market is struggling
to maintain trend. I would think that this upward trend is very close to a completion.
An orthodox evaluation of the wave structure throughout the past several weeks indi-
cates a diagonal triangle formation unfolding, this implies that the end is in sight. Even
if this market were to stage one more advance I would not remain long after viewing
this formation, a collapse could occur at any time.

NOW THAT WE HAVE COVERED ALL OF THE GEOMETRIC CHARTING
TECHNIQUES FOR SQUARING PRICE TO TIME WE CAN PROCEED IN THE
ART OF USING THIS INFORMATION AS A GUIDE TO FUTURE FORECAST-
ING OF MARKET TREND.

Chp. 11 Page. 112
VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

MARKETS UNFOLD IN A SYMMETRY OF MATHEMATICAL DEGREE TO THE
PAST. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PAST TRENDS AND FUTURE TRENDS
WILL FALL INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES, ARITHMETIC, GEOMETRIC
OR HARMONIC VIBRATIONS. SOMETIMES MINOR MOVES ARE INTER-
RUPTED BY LONGER TERM VIBRATIONS, THESE VIBRATIONS COULD
EMANATE FROM PREVIOUS INTERMEDIATE, PRIMARY OR CYCLE WAVES.
SHOCKS ALONG THE WAY OFTEN PROVIDE NEW INGREDIENTS INTO THE
OTHERWISE PERFECT SYMMETRY THAT IS PRESENTLY UNFOLDING.

Arithmetic ratios are 33.3% 50% 66.6%
Geometric ratios are 38.2% 61.8% 161.8%

Harmonic ratios are 70.7% 141.4%

As analysts we must appreciate that we are only human and can get misled into believ-
ing as others do that all will work out as we now see it. Often because we are human
we have neglected to keep up our technical calculations. Failure to recognize a trading
opportunity mostly lies with this shortcoming not the method.

MARKET SYMMETRY

The main difference between using range vibration angles instead of standard
geometric angles on daily, weekly and monthly charts is that an equality with time and
price is always maintained between each chart of a different time series.

Some Gann analysts will no doubt be having great success using standard geometric
angles and I would not in anyway discourage the use of these angles as they hold their
rightful place in the art of time and price analysis. Before I illustrate vibration angles
on the Mount Isa Mines chart I have included a chart (Fig 11.6), illustrating standard
geometric angles on the weekly chart just so we can see their effective use. What I
wish to point out is that this chart has just had price values adjusted for an issue. The
1x1 angle at $0.025 per week would not have placed the angles in the same position
relative to future time and price previous to three weeks ago.

VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

FIG 11.6 = MOUNT ISA MINES WEEKLY WITH STANDARD GEOMETRIC
ANGLES AT 2.5 CENTS PER WEEK SCALE (2x1) (1x1) (1x2).

On the face of it they appear to be working quite well as an indicator of support and
resistance. The only anomaly is that this price series was just adjusted 7% in value 3
weeks ago and prior to that these angles would have been positioned quite differently
on the old price series. Whereas now the 1x1 vibration of the chart major low to high
is 0.04981 per week (equal to a 2x1 angle of 0.025) before it would have been (99 cents
to $ 3.80 in 53 weeks [ 380-99/53 equals 0.0530]).

FIG 11.7 = MOUNT ISA MINES WEEKLY - VIBRATION SQUARING OF THE
MAJOR RANGE.

The power of geometric analysis is now in high gear, both price and time have been
squared to the vibration of the chart low / high range and projected across the ensuing
price series.

A geometric relationship of price to time exists at every level from either the horizon-
tal price, vertical time or diagonal time price angles, intersections of the inner circle
with diagonal angles form some strict relationship of the circle to the square. The main
levels to watch are as stated earlier, the .382, .5, .618 and 100% areas as they are direct-
ly related to both the square and the golden rectangle. As one becomes proficient
using these methods the relationships of the lesser degree vibrations will tie in as con- -
firmations of the inter- relating range vibrations of multiple waves projected across the
same data.

FIG 11.8 = BULL RANGE VIBRATIONS OF THE SQUARE

In this chart I have endeavored to illustrate how accurately precise angle vibrations can
act as support and resistance within absolute values of the progressing price patterns.
In this chart an intermediate low and high of the market fell exactly on the 50% and
100% time levels of the previous range, the high on the 100% time level squared the
50% level of the previous range in price, this is a classic squaring of price and time in
Gann degree. The low made at the 50% time vibration was a 66.6% decline in value
from the high of the chart which also confirmed time and price intersecting at this
point. This is better illustrated in Fig 11.12

FIG 11.9 = VIBRATIONS OF BOTH THE BULL AND BEAR CYCLE FORWARD

The angles across this chart after the mid point of the square combine both the vibra-
tions of the bull range as well as the vibrations of the bear range. The angles down
from the high are in square ratios ie 50% and 100% vibration of the bull vibration and
Fibonacci ratios of the bear range ie 38.2% and 61.8%, (these ratios I use when I start
the angles from the beginning of the squared range). The angle up from the low is a
1x1 vibration of the bear range. The 1x1 up and the 0.618 down cross at the 0.618 time
of the bull market square and intersect price at the exact reversal point. This time
vibration of the bear market square is 0.236 (0.618*0.618*0.618).

The 0.382 angle down crosses the 1x1 angle up at exactly the mid point of the range of
the bull square, the upper angle that squares the 100% time and 50% price intersec- .
tion is the 1x2 angle of the bull market down from the high.

The low made at the 66.6% discount to the high price fell 131 trading days from the
high, this was in the 27th week forward of the high. The previous bull market range
shown on the earlier charts was 259 trading days and 53 weeks. Time missed by two
trading days but still fell in the right week for this low. The last high price at the end of
the chart where the reversal occurred at the 50% price level of the bull market range
was 256 trading days from the high and in the 53rd week, 371 calendar days forward of
the high exactly 53 weeks. The bull market range was exactly 372 calendar days, the
lesson here is that the major range of the bull market was overriding time of the bear
market range, meaning that the greater the range the greater the future influence.

This chart bears out how accurately these methods can track the symmetry of markets
over long periods of time.

When plotting vibration angles do so by weeks, trading days and calendar days. You
will find on occasions that time periods will balance out perfectly for all charts, these
are the times we can be sure of our signals to the exact day. At other times when a
slight variation is apparent revert to the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers as a guide to

VIBRATION OF PRICE AND TIME

Summary of important vibration ratios to monitor.

Watch the price levels reached at times when a market is squaring the time vibration
of a range at 38.2% 50% 61.8% and 100%. Anytime a price vibration of 38.2% 50%
61.8% or 100% is achieved at the same time means that the symmetry is perfect and a
counter trend reversal will follow.

These are exceptional areas from which to trade for fast profits. Remember there is no
necessity to overtrade. An educated trader only needs four or five major trades per
year to increase his trading account by 300% or more.

Throughout this chapter I have concentrated on the ratios 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and
100%. These ratios, are the most common used by technical analysts familiar with
these techniques. Before proceeding it would be wise to mention that 33.3% and
66.6% can be just as valid for a reversal in trend, also 70.7% half of root two.

Ratios of lesser importance are 23.6%, 25%, 27.2%, 75%, 76.4%, 85.4% and 87.5%.
Vibrations of past waves of lesser current significance often fall on these ratios at the
same time a major squaring occurs in 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% or 100% adding extra confir-
mation to the unfolding pattern.

Strongest signals for a reversal of the current trend will be when vibrations of
PRIMARY WAVES, INTERMEDIATE WAVES and MINOR WAVES square in a
cluster around a future date. A combination of 50% and 61.8% or 100% and 161.8%
or 50% and 100% are just a few to remember.

Study and observation of a single market will, in time, alert you to the recognition
and knowledge of which ratios are important.

Since one cannot be sure of the market volatility prior to important time signals, it
pays to monitor the market sentiment as a barometer of what to expect. I see the
markets as a chess game, we have valuable tools to use to plan our attack, but in the
final analysis if we are foolish traders we will never make any money from our
knowledge. No two traders are the same, each must have a plan that makes them com-
fortable. Develop particular strategies for specific market conditions; sometimes an op-
tion play can be extremely rewarding with low risk in a fast moving market, other
times a move will ultimately go in your favor, yet the time taken will be too long
making options worthless even when your analysis is correct. I have found several ap-
proaches are needed if one is to continually profit from the markets. Another word of
advice is too only follow a limited number of markets. Keep up with the fundamental
news for each market, when important news reaches the public and the chart price pat-
terns have already reflected this news, a counter trend reaction often occurs.

There are other disciplined ways to monitor market sentiment, the methods | use are:-
1. Bullish Consensus.
2. Relative Strength Indices.
3. Elliott Wave Analysis.

It may only take a limited time period to learn the methods outlined in this book, but to trade suc-
cessfully is an art and requires a professional approach.

BULLISH CONSENSUS

A bullish consensus poll is a good barometer of the mass psychological forces underly-
ing a particular commodity or stock. Expert advisors are polled for their opinion on fu-
ture market direction, overall opinion is rated between 0% and 100%. 100% readings
would mean that everybody thought the market was going up, 0% readings would indi-
cate everybody thought the market was going down. However these extremes are rare-

Chp. 12 Page. 125
CONFIRMING TREND TECHNIQUES

ly reached and 80% to 20% is the general range. The higher or lower the bullish con-
sensus reading when a change in trend is indicated, the more volatile the ensuing move
will be.

Many books have been published on bullish consensus and the power of contrary think-
ing. My advice is to purchase one for your library and refer to it regularly.

My logic, when it comes to the bullish consensus, is that if everyone is bullish then
they have all bought; who else is left to buy, only the uneducated public, whose funds
will soon be depleted at high prices. When the bullish consensus is very bearish
everyone has sold out and selling pressure is reducing. Sooner or later prices will ap-
pear to be at bargain levels and new buyers will emerge to reverse the downward path.
A study of past volume and open interest charts will confirm this observation.

RELATIVE STRENGTH INDICES

There are many different indicators that can be used under this heading, they are all
mathematical calculations based on the past market ranges over specific time frames.
From my experience it is only necessary to have one indicator as they all tell you the
same thing, some faster or slower than others.

To reduce the conflict of opinion I use the popular indicator made famous by J. WEL-
LES WILDER Jr. A 7 day, 10 day and 14 day RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX can
tell you all you need to know regarding the position of system traders and the strength
of trend.

The detailed interpretation for this index can be found in the book "NEW CON-
CEPTS IN TECHNICAL TRADING SYSTEMS" by J. Welles Wilder Jr. One of the
better features of this index is the way it diverges at major swing highs and lows in the
market. A divergence is seen when the price rises to a new high yet the oscillator fails
to make a higher reading than it did at the last peak in price.

The following chart (FIG 12.1) shows examples of the RELATIVE STRENGTH diver-
gence readings when the ALL ORDINARIES INDEX made its all time high and the
crash low in 1987.

FIG 12.2 of the Japanese Yen IMM against the US$ is a good example of the confir-
mation offered by the divergence in RELATIVE STRENGTH at important time inter-
vals in the market performance. The major high of December 31st, 1987 had so many
time calculations for a trend reversal it was a set up. Bullish consensus was approach-
ing 100% with many experts predicting a further 15% rise in the Yen to the dollar. A
banker whom I had told several days earlier that the Yen would not break 120 to the
dollar, was so impressed that he approved the purchase of my software package for his
technical analyst in January 1988.

and right at this time the bullish consensus for the dollar is nearing 85%. The RELA-
TIVE STRENGTH INDEX is diverging with price, several minor time periods and
price squarings have arrested the downward trend, and a double bottom has been
formed. All we need now is a specific time and price target to plan an entry for the
reaction to this downtrend when it is signaled. Maybe there will be one more
downward thrust to finish off this move from December. Only careful analysis of time

and price can give us this answer.

ELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS

The accepted expert on this subject is Robert R. Prechter, Jr. He has published two

books which are mandatory study for the student of ratio analysis.

"THE MAJOR WORKS OF R.N. ELLIOTT" Edited by Robert R. Prechter, Jr. and
"ELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE - Key to stock market profits" by Frost and Prechter.

Following is an outline of the important points that I have noted for my own use of the

ELLIOTT wave theory.

Chp. 12 Page. 128
CONFIRMING TREND TECHNIQUES

ELLIOTT WAVE STRUCTURES

To keep track of the stages that a bull or bear market moves through, Ralph Elliott
developed a lettering system for waves of varying degree.

Waves are broken down in stages from CYCLE - PRIMARY - INTERMEDIATE - MINOR - MINUTE.

The same principle applies in waves of minute degree as to waves of cycle degree. Im-
pulse waves have a minimum S legs, corrections have minimum 3 legs.

A minute wave structure when completed fulfills a completed stage of a minor wave
and so on. ie five minute waves will make up a minor wave one.

ELLIOTT WAVE STRICT RULES

As a general rule markets will advance in five waves and contract in three waves.

In an upward moving market there will be three major impulse waves and two corrective waves. The
impulse waves will have a minimum of five minor waves and the corrective waves will have a mini
mum of three waves. Trend can be established by the direction of waves containing five wave se-
quences.

During corrective waves a decline in volume will signal a relief to selling pressure and possible trend
reversal.

Corrective waves of a major nature in a five wave sequence will alternate. This means that a simple
correction will be followed by a complex correction. A simple correction is an a b c three wave

movement. A complex correction generally contains 5 movements. Complex corrections are forms
of a triangular appearance on a price chart.

Triangles are far more common in fourth waves.

The third wave in a five wave sequence is usually the longest wave, but never the shortest.
Wave four in a five wave sequence should not overlap wave one except within diagonal triangles.

Wave four corrections will most often than not terminate within the area of the previous wave four of
lesser degree.

Extensions can only occur in impulse waves, and are very common, this will give an impulse wave
seven to a maximum of nine waves.

Impulse waves always contain five waves minimum and up to nine waves with extensions.

CORRECTIVE WAVES WILL RELATE TO IMPULSE WAVES IN BOTH TIME AMPLITUDE AND
PRICE AMPLITUDE.

IMPULSE WAVES WILL RELATE TO IMPULSE WAVES IN BOTH TIME AND PRICE AMPLITUDE.

GROUND GAINED OR LOST IN MARKET ADVANCES OR CONTRACTIONS CAN BE ACCURATE-
LY MEASURED, WAVE STRUCTURE IS A FUNCTION OF HUMAN EMOTION.

WHEN A MARKET MAKES A SIGNIFICANT HIGH, BULLISH CONSENSUS WILL BE AT A MAXI-
MUM.

AT IMPORTANT LOWS BEARISH CONSENUS WILL BE AT ITS VERY WORST.

ELLIOTT WAVE CHARACTERISTICS

WAVE ONE OF A NEW BULL MARKET

Wave one will be either a slow basing type movement as accumulation takes place from the previous
downtrend, or a dynamic thrust caused by the large number of short traders covering positions in an
oversold market.

When evaluating the price level potential for a wave one advance | find it better to use percentage in-
creases of the bear market low. By squaring the low price to 25% 33.3% 50% 66.6% et cetera, will
nearly always tell one where this first wave will find resistance. The reason is quite simple, a bear
market terminates because prices have reached a level that even the bears consider cheap by pre-
vious standards. The low price becomes the new standard by which future prices are measured. It
really depends on how far prices were decimated in the previous bear market as to the possibility
and extent of a fast recovery. Any retracement in excess of 25% of the previous bear market is
generally a sign that a new bull trend is in the making.

THE BEGINNING OF WAVE ONE SHOULD COINCIDE WITH A MAJOR TIME AND PRICE
SQUARING OF THE PREVIOUS BEAR MARKET.

WAVE TWO OF A NEW BULL MARKET

Second waves often appear to be part of the previous bear phase as they often retrace
much if not all of the first wave up. They are not inspiring moves to create the atmos-
phere for a new bull market. Wave two will generally retrace 50% to 61.8% of the
wave one advance.

Wave structure in second waves is the best guide to the retracement level. A simple
zig zag correction can take on the following appearance; phase (a) corrects between
25% and 38.2% of the wave one advance, phase (b) retraces 61.8% of wave (a), wave
(c) for [2] terminates at the 61.8% or 100% projection level of wave (a). It will normal-
ly depend on the depth of the first (a) wave to determine if a correction of over 50%
to wave one can be expected.

A careful study of corrective wave structures is recommended because identifying wave
two bottoms is one of the best ways to become rich trading leveraged markets. Option
premiums are virtually given away as a wave two terminates.

WAVE THREE OF A NEW BULL MARKET

Third waves are often long and broad. The trend is unmistakable. Fundamental news is
entering the market and instilling confidence in the future. As they progress market
sentiment will be so high.one would think there will never be an end to the current
trend. Third waves are the best waves to identify and trade for the long haul. Minor
corrections are often very shallow affairs as the move really gets going.

Third waves, IF SIMPLE, usually advance to the 161.8% level of the wave one ad-
vance, either measured from the wave two low or the wave one high. 61.8% advance

on the wave one expansion is a minimum target.

WAVE THREE TARGETS BASED ON WAVE ONE PROJECTIONS SHOULD BE
61.8% THEN 100% THEN 161.8% THEN 200% THEN 223.6% THEN 261.8%

FOURTH WAVES IN THE OLD BULL MARKET

Fourth waves are predictable in as much as they see the sentiment turn from one of hope to one of
despair. The bullish index will fall to the lowest readings seen for months. Soothsayers will be
predicting the end of the bull market and further falls as the fourth wave terminates. Johnny come
latelys to the market will be in a state of nervousness. The public have usually entered at the late
stages of the third wave.

Fourth waves often take on a triangular appearance due to the fight backwards and forwards be-
tween the longer term trend and the frightened traders. When the local share market (Australian All
Ordinaries Index) was distributing this year (1987) before the final advance, a head and shoulders
pattern emerged as the previous intermediate fourth wave low was tested. Many chartists were trick-
ed into believing that the top had been attained, instead the next advance gained 33% in value from
the wave four low. A word of warning regards the count in a fourth wave is this, sometimes wave (1)
of wave five will double bottom with the wave four low giving the appearance that it is part of the
fourth wave structure, this can often leave you a wave short on your fifth wave count. This can be dis-
astrous when you believe a market has one more upswing to complete a valid Elliott wave count. To
quote a friend “Elliott wave analysis is similar to a love affair with a beautiful woman! Until something
goes wrong."

Fourth waves usually retrace only 14.6% or 23.6% of the upmove of the third wave or sometimes of
the total range from the bull market start. A 38.2% retracement in fourth waves of lesser degree is
common.

Whenever you identify a triangular formation it is nearly always signaling a base for one more ad-
vance. This is the distribution phase catching all the latecomers. Once a fifth wave breaks above the
third wave high even the traders who exited through the distribution phase are attracted back into
the market.

FIFTH WAVES THE END OF THE BULL MARKET

Fifth waves can be either dynamic or mild. The market will be pessimistic to the future and the first
wave of the fifth will be a laboured affair as the so called experts continue to sell into the advance,
refusing to believe that the bull market is still intact.

Fifth waves can fail to reach the high point of the third wave, this will be signaled only if a clear five
wave count can be identified.

Once a fifth wave breaks above the previous third wave top the fundamentals will be changing yet
the market is not listening. Human nature will be buying the market as greed becomes more ap-
parent. No one will be predicting the top, quite the contrary, the so called experts will be advocating
that the market is headed for even more ridiculous highs. The public will be fully invested and the
commercials will be distributing as much as they can. The local taxi driver will have an opinion on
the market due to the latest interest being created by the media. No one will listen to sensible ad-
vice when it comes to investments, brokerage houses will be recording huge profit results.

A dynamic fifth wave will expand 161.8% of the first three waves above the third wave high.

WAVE A OR ONE OF THE NEW BEAR MARKET

A waves are usually viewed as corrections to an overheated market they are generally
short and swift, it depends upon the volume of trading that takes place that determines
the amount of panic that they create. The A wave will generally take out the bull
market fourth wave low, this is the confirmation of the new bear market. At the con-
clusion of the A wave the regulatory authorities and the media will make all the ex-
cuses about the place for the sudden fall. Before the bear market can continue a size-
able retracement to the crash wave must be completed. As the retracement progresses
it will seem to the casual observer that all is well. [FAR FROM IT]

USEFULNESS OF ELLIOTT WAVE

Elliott wave analysis is an extraordinary tool when used in the manner discovered by
Ralph Elliott in the early thirties. On the other hand, if you believe that each wave will
fall into the same pattern as the theory you will become horribly disillusioned with the
whole concept.

The Elliott wave theory was formulated around the Dow Jones Industrial Averages,
primarily Elliott intended its use in determining price levels of support and resistance
in the stock market. The stock market is an ever growing monster of capitalization
and as such will continue to advance as long as the civilization behind that market is in-
tact. This is not the case with commodities as they are expendable and prices rise and
fall during periods of over and under supply. Substitutes become more viable at times
of high prices and this in turn keeps the lid on further advances. Wave structures in
commodities unfold obeying the basic tenets of time and price, but more often than
not, many Elliott wave rules have to be broken if one is to apply a long term wave
count over more than 10 years. Another characteristic common to commodities is that
they move in the more complex wave structures outlined in the theory.

The best guide to a wave count on commodities is the mass psychology readings taken
at extreme turning points in trend, if you label your waves accordingly you will have a
better chance at forecasting the future direction of that market.

FIRST PINPOINT TIME VIBRATIONS IN MARKETS

Before ever making a trade you must evaluate the prospects of a timing signal that is
strong enough, based on your knowledge of market timing, to signal a reaction to the
current trend. Once all the fundamentals are known the technicals will obey natural
law.

Once these future areas of time are calculated and they interrelate with other vibra-
tions of time we can evaluate the prospects for a successful trade.

If you accept that all minor, intermediate and primary swing highs or lows are related
in time in relationships of the square, circle or golden rectangle, your discipline will
never be questioned.

CONFIRMING TREND TECHNIQUES

The following six charts show how the Australian stock BHP LTD made highs and
lows in perfect time relationships to past cycles. Study each chart and see if you can
piece the structure of this market together. It is important that you understand the
mathematics that go into calculating the vibrations if you are to excel in this method of
analysis. Many students may find that they have a mental block due to lack of mathe-
matical knowledge, this is not a problem if you just admit to yourself that you can
learn, some will take longer than others. It is not any impossible task if you are dedi-
cated and patient. Once you have mastered this area of understanding your whole ap-
preciation of markets will take on a calm approach to the future. You will never be
afraid of the markets when it comes to making a trade. Always remember that TECH-
NICAL ANALYSIS is a SCIENCE, profitable TRADING is an ART.

DATA BASE CONSIDERATIONS

13. RECORDING STOCK OR COMMODITY PRICE

Charts are prepared from past records of stock and commodity price history, if we wish
to correctly analyze a chart then it is imperative that our data base is correct.

COMMODITY PRICE HISTORIES

There are numerous ways to plot commodity prices correctly.

1. CASH PRICES
2. 1st MONTH FUTURES continuous

3. SEASONAL DELIVERY MONTH continuous

W.D. Gann discovered that seasonal commodities maintain geometric relationships
with the past when plotted on a continuous basis. For instance you will have seen ex-
amples earlier in this book for the NYCSE SUGAR MARCH delivery or the
COMEX GOLD DECEMBER delivery, each of these charts were constructed using
only prices from their respective contract months.

To maintain a seasonal history for a particular contract delivery month we must gather
the price history for that contract on the active delivery month. This means that for 12
months out from delivery we are geometrically relating forward price. On long-term
charts we are relating previous years of continuous price history for a particular
delivery month.

To correctly maintain a COMEX GOLD DECEMBER chart requires data only from
the December delivery, ie. we start the chart when the exchange first began trading the

Chp. 13 Page. 145
DATA BASE CONSIDERATIONS

December contract, this was in early 1975. At the end of December 1975 when that
contract expired we continue with prices from the December 1976 contract, when that
expires we plot December 1977 and so on until our chart is up to date.

CHARTS CONSTRUCTED IN THIS STYLE ARE TERMED GEOMETRIC
CHARTS, commonly referred to in the industry as Gann style charts.

With commodities, forward prices can run ata
premium or discount to the cash price, this will
mean that a geometric chart could have its
important highs or lows on different dates to the
cash market. When working with a particular
commodity it is important to keep at a minimum two
geometric charts, for instance with Gold | keep both
DECEMBER and JUNE continuous. The best idea is
to keep two contract delivery months 180 degrees
apart (six months), this way you will always have a
reasonably active market to trade. When it comes to
trading signals work only from your geometric
chart. Other price series such as CASH or 1st
MONTH FUTURES can be used to confirm ones
opinion derived from the geometric data.

Do not mix data from two exchanges or different locations, if you wish to stick strictly
to these rules.

Chp. 13 Page. 146
DATA BASE CONSIDERATIONS

If a contract specification is ever changed then all previous prices will need to be ad-
justed to remain geometric. This seldom occurs these days but the case I had in mind
was COCOA, originally prices were quoted in cents per pound, currently prices are
quoted in dollars per tonne.

STOCK PRICE HISTORIES

The geometric relationship for particular stock prices is their ratio of value to market
capitalization. For instance on inception a company could issue 10 million shares at
$1.00, for a capitalization of $10,000,000. Whilst these shares are trading above or
below the original $1.00 they are registering the perception of that companies value in
relationship to the $10,000,000 capitalization.

When an issue changes a companies capitalization, past share price data must be ad-
justed to maintain the true geometric relationship of past price to future price.

Companies can change their market capitalization by issuing bonus shares to
shareholders in several ways.

Shares can be issued at no charge, for example as a 1 for 4 bonus. This will mean that
in future we will now have 5 shares for every 4 that existed in the past. All prices prior
to the issue will have to be adjusted by 20%. If a share was trading at $1.00 prior to a 1
for 4 bonus issue that price when adjusted would equate to 80 cents.

To explain this further so there is no confusion, 4 shares at $1.00 equal $4.00, now 5
Shares equal $4.00 since each shareholder has been given 1 extra share for every 4 pre-
viously held. $4.00 divided by 5 equals 80 cents.

Another way a company can raise extra capital is to have an issue at a price. Generally
they strike the issue price below the market value of the existing shares. A form of
issue could be 1 for 4 at 50 cents, when a share is trading at $1.00. This means that 4
shares are worth $4.00 at the moment and after the issue, 5 shares are worth $4.50,
slightly more complicated.

Chp. 13 Page. 147
DATA BASE CONSIDERATIONS

The correct procedure is to calculate the BONUS content implied by the issue.

Before issue 4 shares at $1.00 equals $4.00 or $1.00 per share.

After issue 5 shares now equal $4.50 or 90 cents per share.

Bonus content is $1.00 divided by 90 cents equals a 1 to 1.1111 stock split with the past.

Past prices must be adjusted accordingly, this means that for every old 10,000 shares
we adjust their value as if there were 11,111. A reduction of 11.11% per share.

PRICE IN TIME FROM PAST SHARE PRICE

I have found that if a stock has split regularly, as happens on the Australian share
market then it is not such a good idea to place any faith in converting static price
values to time. All other methods of analysis are valid as the percentage relationships
between past and future price maintain strict geometric relationships. Best results in
any analysis are achieved through the use of range vibration techniques in any case.

CORRECT DATA MEANS ACCURATE ANALYSIS

Before embarking on a career of speculation using the methods outlined in this text be
sure that you have your facts straight. Double and triple check your data base for ac-
curacy, correct price history and no days missing. A workman is only as good as his
tools.

Chp. 13 Page. 148
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

14. STEPS REQUIRED FOR COMPREHENSIVE
TIME & PRICE ANALYSIS

The first section of this chapter uses Australia’s number one company BHP LTD to
demonstrate the steps I would take to create a base for future analysis.

Before we can undertake any analysis we need to procure long-term monthly price his-
tory for at least 20 years, longer if the information is available. In this case we will be
making a study of a stock that has had many share splits and bonus issues throughout
its history so it is imperative that the data be free of any errors. If you do not have ac-
curate data then it is impossible to implement time and price analysis with reliability.
Do not take someone else’s word that new data is correct until you have checked its ac-
curacy yourself, this may involve some research but I have learnt through bitter ex-
perience that this must be done.

STEP 1. RECORD ALL IMPORTANT HIGHS AND LOWS

The first thing we need to do is record all cycle and primary waves high and low turn-
ing points, actual traded price, current adjusted price and the date of each swing point.
As we approach current times we can record intermediate and minor wave swing highs
and lows of importance.

A major swing high or low market day is the day that the psychological imbalance be-
tween buyers and sellers reached its zenith. The price recorded is a measure of buyer
support or resistance that is extremely important for the future, examples throughout
this text attest to this fact. The time period between each swing of cycle and primary
degree is even more important for our future calculations.

Creating a history fact file can be done quickly if you have the tools, run a percentage
change swing chart on your daily data. You could use monthly data, but this will re-
quire extra work in locating the exact date the market made its high or low. Primary
waves and cycle waves should be generated on swings greater than 15%.

An initial observation I have just made is this. The highest physical price BHP LTD
has ever traded was $25.75 in June 1968, the second highest level was $17.60 in Novem-
ber 1980. Both of these levels will retain a psychological barrier for the future, irrespec-
tive of the current price dilution caused by share issues and splits.

CYCLE PHASE I-II

The major bear market from 1968 concluded on 30th September 1974, here a new
cycle began so I have started a fresh wave count. In my opinion the bull market cycle
that started in 1974 and finished in 1980 was a cycle I. The 1982 low at $ 1.44 over-
lapped the primary wave [1] of I high of $1.64 which normally (under Elliott strict

rules) discounts this low being a cycle IV wave.
The loss in value from the 1980 high to the 1982 low was 65.5%

days against a bull market period from 1974 to 1980 of 2241 cal
age terms 33.5%.

an ideal ratio between
61.8% and 66.6% for a second wave. The time period for the fall was 752 calendar
endar days, in percent-

CYCLE PHASE III_ 1982-1987

The next cycle phase from 1982 to 1987 unfolded in five major waves. Cycle high III of
$11.10 fell exactly on the second price square projection of cycle I ($0.72 to $4.17 =
$3.45), ($11.10 less $4.17 = $6.93), ($4.17 plus 2 times $3.45 = $11.07). [See FIG
12.18 page 144] :

The crash wave of 1987 followed a bull market from 1974 that ran 13 years, a 50%
retracement of the overall advance from $0.72 to $11.10 calculated to a price target of

Chp. 14 Page. 155
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

$5.91, the low at [A] was $5.98 and the low at [4] was $5.93, these waves were nearly
100% square in price and both equal to 50% of the 1974 to 1987 range.

My conclusion to date is that this particular option is either in a new bull market or a
[C] wave of cycle IV. Considering that the cycle II wave from 1980 to 1982 was a
simple zig zag formation, then under the Elliott wave interpretation of alternation be-
tween corrective waves in a sequence, we should be expecting a triangular formation to
unfold. So long as the low at $5.98 holds then a cycle degree V wave should take this
option to new highs sometime in the distant future.

The test will be to see how long prices continue to trade above the $5.91 mid point of
the 1974-1987 range. If we project the time of the 1982-1987 range forward 38.2% we
get July 1989, if this stock continues to trade above the [A] wave low up until this time
it will be fairly certain that this count is the correct one.

You will notice that I have not labeled the last high of $8.90 of June 1988 as a [B] as
yet, it is possible that $8.90 is a (1) of a V, we will discuss this as we move on.

FIG 14.4 ALTERNATIVE WAVE COUNT FOR CYCLE Ill

Chp. 14 Page. 156
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

The weekly chart (FIG 14.4) shows even more interesting time and price relationships
unfolding between the primary and cycle waves. The range of the 1982 low (II) $1.44
(which incidentally was 100% square in price with the 1974 low of $0.72) to the wave
[3] high of $6.27 was $4.83. $4.83 added to $6.27 gave a price range square target of
$11.10 (which was the exact high made on the 16th September 1987).

Wave [A] or IV ($5.98 871211) of my cycle IV has held above wave [4] of III (fig 14.1)
indicating that the long-term trend is still intact.

Also this may just be a coincidence but the range of the 1974 low $0.72 to the [3] of III
at $6.27 in 1985 (fig 14.4) was $5.55, this range doubled ie $5.55 times 2 equals $11.10
(the III wave high price).

WHERE TO FROM HERE

Firstly we must verify all of the support zones post Cycle wave III. This will surely tell
us what the possibility is of another crash wave emerging in this wave series.

We need to identify the last intermediate swing high and low. From there we can apply
a short term Elliott wave count and evaluate where we are likely to go from here.

Secondly we can calculate all of the cycle and primary wave SQUARES of PRICE and
RANGE for future support and resistance estimates.

Thirdly we calculate all time vibration measurements forward so we have an idea
where to expect trend changes.

Fourthly we will conduct research on Minor and Intermediate waves to evaluate which
vibration ratios this option tends to vibrate around in lesser degree waves.

Fifthly we can examine the fundamental position of this company as a guide to its fu-
ture standing among investors.

Some chartists (who are not true technical analysts, and most often hopeless traders) will probably
not bother with the last exercise as they believe this information will be reflected in the price. Please
don't follow their guide, if you intend to trade your own advice and expect to make a profit.

Chp. 14 Page. 157
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

FUNDAMENTALS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE PRICE LONG BEFORE THE NEWS HITS THE
STREET, SO THINK AHEAD. STUDY THE LONGER TERM FUNDAMENTALS, NOT THE DAY TO DAY
NOISE.

Treat each commodity or stock that you trade, AS A BUSINESS.

MARKETS CAN ONLY DO THREE THINGS, MOVE UP IN PRICE, DOWN IN
PRICE OR SIDEWAYS IN PRICE.

WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR A CHANGE IN TREND WE WILL KNOW
FROM OUR TIME VIBRATIONS - IT WILL ALSO BE AN ASSISTANCE IF WE
CAN CONFIRM A PRICE SQUARING AT THE SAME TIME.

WAVE STRUCTURE POST 1987 HIGH $11.10

Once we have formed a long-term opinion on the state of an option we can proceed to
analyze the closer in price action to see if it is telling the same story.

By running a percentage swing chart in ratios that reflect the Minor degree waves we
can see the shorter term market vibrations unfolding in a very clear manner.

This chart Fig 14.5 certainly has a message that is important to the longer term cause.
The low of $5.98 (December 11th, 1987 formed a double bottom with the primary
wave [4] of III low) which lies on the 50% level of the 1974-1987 RANGE, this
CHART is indicating strong support at this level. It is always possible that this market
could trade below this level, yet since the rally to $8.90 we have had 4 lows registered
at $6.60, this level is now indicating major support. Another thing is that the rally from
February 1988 expanded in five waves. (See Fig 14.6)

4 found support at the iv wave low of lesser degree before the 5 wave blasted up to
$8.90 (50% square with $5.91 [50% of the 1974 to 1987 range]).

Is the high of $8.90 a [B] (primary bear market rally in a sustained bear market or a
(1) wave of a new expansion), looks more like a (1) to me, even though the wave 1
has been overlapped at the last low of $6.60 indicating a large diagonal triangle. The
importance of this will of course be found out in the near future. An important point
worth mentioning is the discipline that we can now apply to these findings. If $6.60
breaks then we will need to reassess the present scenario I have put forward and ac-
cept the alternative. If $8.90 is broken on the upside then we can project new highs
forming at a rapid rate, as fund managers and traders who have been sidelined, rush to

FIG 14.7 HOW STRONG WAS THE LOW AT $6.60 ON DECEMBER 5TH 1988

If you were to use the supports previously mentioned, $6.60 for a wave (2) seems to be
an impenetrable barrier at this time. By combining standard charting practice and
drawing a trend line, you find that this aspect also added to the geometric support.
What was even more important was the time duration from $5.98 to $6.60, low to low,
at twelve months (360 days exactly [degrees in a circle]) and 985 calendar days from
$4.97 (right on the Fibonacci number [give a day or two] 987). Time was present at this
low, this adds an almighty weight to my analysis at any time.

The alternative of course, should the market break below $6.60, is for support at $5.90
(50% of the 1974-87 range) or $5.55 (50% square of the 1987 high $11.10).

LAST INTERMEDIATE AND MINOR ELLIOTT WAVE SWING POINT

To remain on the conservative side, at least until we receive more conformation, I will
assume that $8.90 (880601) is still a [B] of primary degree. To disprove this analysis
$6.60 (881205) would need to be confirmed as a (2) [intermediate wave two].

question.. What would need to happen to confirm $6.60 (881205) as a (2)?

answer.. A retracement greater than 38.2% of the range $8.90 to $6.60.

reason.. If we are currently in a [C] (primary bear market impulse wave) then $6.60 (881205) has to
be counted as a (3) [intermediate wave three of five]. It then follows that we are now in a (4) [inter-

mediate wave four]. Wave four (normally) in an impulse wave sequence should not retrace more
than 38.2% of its advance.

ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

The moment of truth is close at hand, it is now January 13th, 1989 and the market has
traded within 2 cents of the 38.2% retracement level.

More importantly this market appears to be impulsing, study the wave formations un-
folding in the minor wave from the low. It may of course come to pass that a correc-
tion will occur here just to keep us in suspense for a little longer.

The final outcome will be known for sure just as soon as the downtrend angle is
broken (see fig 14.9). We are either, in a bull market on a convincing break of $7.48 or
in a confirmed bear market on a break of $6.60.

Careful observation of this wave count will illustrate an anomaly mentioned in R.N. EI-
liott’s thesis. A-B formations can form between the end of a bear market and the
begining of the new bull market. Mention is made of this wave form in "THE EL-
LIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE" Frost and Prechter 1981 (page 48).

To accept this wave count and of course to have arrived at it in the first place, one
needed to experience the pschological factors present at the time both the bottom
labeled IV and B were registered.

This market was in proverbial tatters on the days both bottoms were recorded. Bullish
concensus was reading ZERO. Every indicator was hard down. This still did not stop
me from buying a parcel of 50 call options in another stock at the February low (wave
B) on this chart (fig 14.9). My profit was $5150 for an investment of $2972 in 6 weeks.

STEP 3. RECORDING SQUARES OF PRICE SUPPORT AND

SQUARES OF PRICE

1. HIGHEST RECORDED PRICE IN CURRENT CYCLE WAVE SERIES - $11.10
2. LOWEST RECORDED PRICE IN CURRENT CYCLE WAVE SERIES - $0.72

4. MOST RECENT CYCLE OR PRIMARY WAVE HIGH OR LOW - $5.98
The high at $11.10 is covered by selection 1.

SQUARES OF RANGE

1. HIGHEST AND LOWEST CYCLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS - 1974 to 1987

3. PROJECTIONS OF RANGE (0)-(I)

4. PROJECTIONS OF RANGE. (0)-(III)

Chp. 14 Page. 163
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

These prices and ranges would be the most important to monitor for the future. Of
course recent ranges, minor highs and lows can be calculated as the market moves

along.

SQUARES OF PRICE

The simplest way to continually monitor these important levels is on long term month-
ly charts. I have several cork boards strategically placed around my office walls, on
these I keep updated long term charts for the stocks and commodities I wish to trade.
After a while support and resistance levels in markets are committed to memory. This
way it is highly unlikely the markets can arrive at these levels and be overlooked. The
first rule when it comes to trading is, KNOW YOUR BUSINESS.

Now that we have recorded all of the major price levels we can move on to major time
vibrations that may square in the near future.

STEP 4. RECORDING MAJOR TIME VIBRATIONS FOR THE FUTURE

Fundamental input and investor psychology determine the strength in price rises or
falls, yet, time is the ruler of markets. Time has only one axis, always moving forward.
Experiences from the past vibrate forward under cover of the mass subconscious ac-
tions of investors. Once time is overbalanced a reaction to trend will be almost certain.
The universe vibrates about three major ratios, Arithmetic, Geometric and Harmonic.
In terms of cycles (total time of an action and the reaction) we can use these ratios to

Chp. 14 Page. 167
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

determine a logical end to a current trend. Of course within all markets the vibration
of minor, intermediate, primary and cycle degree CYCLES are going on at all times,
strongest areas for a reaction to a current trend are when clusters of vibrations fall
around a future date. For instance the most important event that is imprinted in the in-
vestors memory is the crash of 1987, this will take time to erase. Each time a market
begins a correction to any upward move nervousness will abound, this will continue
until all of those jittery stock holders have quit the market. It then follows that vibra-
tions of the crash wave are the most important to monitor. Fig 12.14 on page 142 gives
a pictorial view of the Geometric vibrations signaling successive lows, in the unfolding
wave structure post 1987 crash in BHP Ltd.

VIBRATIONS OF RANGE TIME THAT I WOULD TRACK WITHOUT DEVIATION:-

1. Squares of vibration of 1987 high (Ill)[$11.10 870916] to crash wave low (IV) [$5.98 871211].
2. Squares of total vibration from 1974 [740930] to 1987. Low $0.72 (0) to high $11.10 (ill).

The first vibration of this report falls on 7th August 1989, when we review the report
for the crash wave vibrations (previous page Fig 14.17) we find that also on 4th
August 1989 we will run the 7th vibration of that range.

This means that a cluster of timing vibrations is being formed in the first week of
August 1989. It is not so important right at this moment, but when we get closer to
this time we can investigate lesser degree vibrations from the Minor wave formations
that will unfold between now and then.

BINGO two clusters with the crash wave vibrations (Fig 14.17 page 169). These are
12th May 1989 and 22nd July 1989.

1.382 is a Geometric relationship and 1.414 (root 2) is a Harmonic vibration.
On July 22nd 1989 to the exact day the crash wave (Fig 14.17) runs a 6.85 Geometric

vibration as this wave runs a Harmonic. I would consider July 22nd an extremely im-
portant vibration point even at this time.

Nothing on this report exactly fits the previous reports (Figures 14.17 to 14.19) al-
though the 0.382 vibration falling on July 12th, 1989 is an important benchmark for the
future. Should the price of BHP LTD stay trading above $ 5.98, I am positive that my
expectation for a new expansion will be correct. 666 is the number of man and this
date is 665 days from the HIGH $11.10, the period July 12th to July 22nd seems to be
an extremely important time period to monitor.

One interesting aspect | have noticed is the reoccurence of November 18th, anniversaries of the
1980 bull market high, form, vibrations on this report at the .666 vibration and a 1/6th vibration on

the report Fig 14.18 page 170.

MONITORING STATIC TIME AND VIBRATIONS ON A DAY TO DAY
BASIS

By preparing a fact file using the details from my price swing charts I can keep track of
long term market vibrations as well as short term vibrations easily.

I have already prepared a long term fact file using the details from the swing chart FIG
14.1 page 153.

For the shorter term I am now preparing a 10% price swing file back to the pre-crash
high $11.10 (870916). This is illustrated in Fig 14.21, Elliott wave analysis made easy.

This report makes the necessary calculations for static time periods and vibration
ratios of previous swing points and time ranges that we should monitor. It needs to be
viewed in two parts. Firstly, time is measured forward from the swing points to the
date of this report. Secondly, squares (Gann methodology) are calculated on the actual
time elapsed. Thirdly, approximate trading days elapsed are calculated, a quick perusal
by a trained eye would alert an experienced analyst to any Fibonacci or Lucas relation-
ships falling close at hand. Fourthly, the next possible important number is selected
from the number bank and the date calculated for its due day.

Interesting position, this market has now formed more than three waves (normal in a
correction phase only 3 waves should form) from the $6.60 low. This certainly does not
appear to be a (4) as the conventional count FIG 14.8 page 161 would have us believe.
However my bullish scenario still has several technical obstacles to overcome before
my preferred count can be substantiated. January 25th will most likely signal a swing
high that will usher in a correction that will terminate on or about February 13th, the
major time frame illustrated in FIG 14.17 - vibration 5 of the crash wave. If the picture
unfolds this way then we could expect the next expansion to last until the major date of
May 10-12 as per Fig 14.17 and Fig 14.19.

FUNDAMENTAL OUTLOOK FOR THIS STOCK

Most pure chartist’s would shudder when I mention fundamental analysis! They con-
sider it is not at all necessary, don’t make their mistake. Markets are vibrating from
shock to shock on the pschological action of traders, underlying all of these price ac-
tions a basis of value exists. What are the general economic conditions? Has this stock
a solid balance sheet? Is it earning profits on a consistent basis? What are the future
prospects for continued growth and profits? Is the management secure and in tune
with investor needs? What is the long term history of this stocks performance? Poor?
Mediocre? Good? Excellent?

THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE!

BHP LTD has managed to fragment the share holding and increase capitalization at
every share offering it has ever made, investors have long term confidence in this
enterprise. Continually it increases it’s earnings and divests it’s holdings.

During the past several years it has been a target for takeover offers, its management
has fought, dealt with and resisted all such attempts.

BHP LTD is now well positioned since the crash of 1987, two record profit performan-
ces of over one billion dollars per year.

Australia’s number one company, large holdings in producing oil fields, mining iron
ore for export, producing steel and other building materials, together with diversified
investments in many other areas, the most prominent of these being a 50% plus hold-
ing in the new Gold producer BHP GOLD LTD which has 3.7 million ounces of Gold
in proven reserves (December 1988) and presently geared to produce 250,000 plus oun-
ces per annum.

Most important BHP pays a dividend that includes imputation tax.

At current price levels I would assume that downside risk is at a minimum, this con-
clusion certainly helps sway me in the direction of my preferred wave count.

There is no point investing in anything unless it has a pedigree, forget about get rich
schemes that presumably will work overnight, the secret to the business (investing for

Chp. 14 Page. 178
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

profit) is investing and trading for the longterm. Search out ships to trade that always
remain afloat, even after capsizing in a storm.

One lesson in investments I have learnt over the years, having participated in the 1970-
74 bear market, the 1981-82 bear market, thankfully through knowledge and good
judgement not the 1987-88 bear market, is that when the proverbial shit hits the fan or
the wave breaks over the ship no amount of hope will ever recover your money. You
will have to rely on the ship uprighting itself and adjusting to the new environment.

If you lose all of your capital you will be bankrupt and out of business. Don’t let this
happen to you. Plan, study, analyse, prepare and attack. If it becomes necessary
retreat and attack another day.

If you wish to trade in speculative areas, make sure that you continually monitor these .
investments, trade only for the short term when every fundamental, be it real or im-
aginative, is in your favor.

No matter what you see, read or hear, unless it is an atomic bomb, markets will con-
tinue to expand and contract on the expectations of traders, as economic conditions
basis the supply and demand laws of nature dictate.

These rules have been with us for several millennium or longer, they will not desert us
now just because it is 1989. The technical approaches I have outlined in this book and
chapter will hold good ad infinitum. They have already stood the test of time.

Always remember this, whenever things are confused, or not going according to plan,
you have not been doing enough analysis work! Start again from scratch and replan
your attack.

Throughout this chapter I have been discussing BHP Ltd, before concluding it will be
necessary to outline my approach to commodity futures contracts. For this I am going
to discuss the Comex Gold complex. In fact I am so fascinated by the gold market I
will probably make this the sole subject of my next book, I am at present writing a bi-
monthly Wave Trader Digest on the day to day technical events that come to pass,
together with future price and time projections, based on the methods outlined in this
text. (call me if you are interested in subscribing).

ANALYSIS PROCEDURES FOR COMMODITY FUTURES
CONTRACTS - COMEX GOLD FUTURES

Refer back to Chapter 13 starting on page 145 for information on how to keep correct
geometric data records for commodity future contracts.

The Comex Gold futures market is the primary world market for Gold. It is important
that one studies a primary market for any commodity that you wish to speculate in.
The beauty of Gold is that since 1974 there has been no possibility of insider trading.
This market is completely free of governmental interference (at least for the time
being). Gold has held a fascination to man over past, present and I expect future
civilizations. For this reason its price trends should obey a natural law, examples
sprinkled throughout this text already testify to this fact.

As a store of wealth, Gold has an intrinsic value, in times of crisis the gold price will
adjust to its correct value in terms of the worthless paper that has been issued world
wide by the controlling central banks.

Present statistics indicate that there is well over 100,000 tonnes (possibly 180,000 ton-
nes) of gold above ground and production is adding approximately 2000 tonnes per
annum. 1 tonne equals 2000 pounds, 2000 pounds equals 32,000 ounces. 2000 tonnes
equals 64 million ounces. At US$ 400.00 per ounce each years production is worth
only US$ 25.6 billion. This value divided into the trillions of dollar debt that exists
(that will never be repaid) is infinitesimal and argues that the only way out, is for gold
prices to inflate. Gold held in reserve by world central banks is estimated as ranging
from 18% to 30% of total above ground stocks.

In the early 80’s the Aden sisters issued a report predicting that gold would rise to
US$ 3000.00 per ounce - this to me is not a silly proposition, the only flaw in their ar-
gument has been the time frame. A valid case can now be made that gold could even-
tually be valued at US$ 5000 per ounce in a hyper inflationary environment.

The present world central banks monetary expansionist policies are creating money
out of thin air by simply running their individual printing presses day and night. The
currency notes on issue are only promises, promises for what? Since most world
central banks abolished the gold standard, currency notes are really IOU nothings. As
more and more paper is circulated at an exponential rate, gold via free market forces
or governmental intervention, in any crisis, will have to inflate.

Chp. 14 Page. 180

All it will take is several years of bad weather or drought. Disruption to food produc-
tion will send food prices into an inflationary spiral. The only beneficiaries will be the
sensible producers who refuse to accept more book debt and demand payment in the
only hard currency that exists; GOLD.

In any case I am diverting from the subject, we are here to learn to identify the techni-
cal signals that will protect and enhance our investments.

This swing chart (FIG 14.26) will probably help clear up my statements on Elliott
waves in commodities, made in chapter 12, page 140. Swings in the larger degree wave
formations tend to be more random in appearance than with stocks or stock indices.
Nevertheless strict ratios exist between each move as the "principle" suggests. I prefer
to count waves in three phase ABC type counts for ease of understanding. When
swings are reduced as I shall show, wave counts become more in tune with the general
perception of the theory see Fig 12.12 page 139.

In January 1970 the free world gold price was trading at a base of US$35.00 per ounce,
this was in times of fixed exchange rates and gold backed currency. On 15th August
1971, President Nixon closed the gold window, this in effect left the US$ without any
redeemable value at all, only paper and whatever anyone else is prepared to give you
in return for this paper. This lack of obligation now extends to most all central banks.

Chp. 14 Page. 182
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

Commercial banks can create money out of thin air as well, did you know that for each
dollar you deposit at the bank they are allowed to (create) lend out 8 against their new
asset. You may wonder how they manage to make such massive profits considering
how inefficiently they are run.

After the major nations floated their exchange rates in 1971 the US$ remained the
worlds reserve currency even though it is now only a promise. Lesser industrialized
countries with suspect credit ratings, in an effort to adjust to the new system, were
forced to borrow US dollars (and mortgage their assets) or pay for international trade
in gold. To accommodate the new system massive loans were made out of newly
created paper (by private banks) to plaster the whole imbalance together. You would
be aware that Russia indirectly pays in gold or oil, not paper, where international trade
is concerned. They have now seen the error of their communistic ways and are intent
on turning to capitalism (this way they can join the IOU system) as an easy way out.
The end result is that Latin American and third world indebtedness has decimated
living standards.

Another by product of monetary expansion is inflation, a political battle has been
waged between governments and central banks to reduce this inflation, less the masses
revolt. Socialist policies abound (need more money? lets print it) to keep the masses
(who know little of what is going on) in their place. Throughout the past twenty years,
debt, inflation, money supply (creation of paper) has accelerated at an unprecedented
rate. This debt has now mortgaged future generations, at the same time destroying the
seeds of past generations. Future generations will not accept this inheritance, this debt
will never be repaid in a million years, it must be written off. The world central banks
monetary system can be compared to a balloon that now needs air at an exponential
rate - how long now before the bubble bursts and gold becomes the judge of paper as-
sets? Fundamental deduction leads me to believe that we are heading into an era of
hyper-inflation, my charts will guide me as we progress so that I will know how to act.

When it comes down to the truth, those pretty looking currency notes (affectionately called green-
backs, marks or yen) really do not have a value, unless someone is prepared to take them in ex-
change for goods. Stay out of debt and invest every dollar you get your hands on. Buy some form of
negotiable asset. Better still invest in a country property near a river or the sea (buy a fishing rod),
this could provide your family safe haven and an opportunity to remain self sufficient. Stock up with
plenty of provisions. It could become extremely hard living out a depression in a large city, especial-
ly if food is in short supply and prices skyrocket. In the mean time get to work and learn how to use
these techniques as a means to get your hands on more assets. Don’t hoard paper (cash) its future
is limited, gold is the only true currency recognized throughout the ages, so make sure that you
have some stashed away for a rainy day.

ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

In an earlier book "Time and Price Analysis of Stock and Commodities" (now out of
print) that I wrote, as a bridge to this text and to get Wave Trader users started. I had
a chart of June Gold with an expected price target of US$404 and US$375 (this was an
update written in March 1988 when it was trading at $470 thereabouts) see page 138
T&PAS&C if you have it. We are now fairly close to the first target as gold has made
lows basis June at $411.20 (890118). December gold traded to $395.50 (880926) and
spot gold made it down to $391.80 (880926) a 50% retracement of the 1985-1987 range
$281.60-$502.30. (which was the case I had in mind for the June contract at the time I
outlined this projection)

Lets prepare a fact file for both June and December contracts. We can then use them
to monitor important time frames for the future.

A careful study of the past 6 swings (FIG 14.28) would have this market in a 6 year
reverse head and shoulders formation, technically the current outlook is that we are
very close to a major low. The next advance could be as explosive as the 1978-1980
bull market.

When looking for time clusters in commodity markets it pays to use all three charts,
ie., In the case of Gold, the spot, December and June contract swing highs and lows.

Time must be kept up for all charts if you are to confirm squarings in advance.

Chp. 14 Page. 186
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

PRIMARY DECISION CHART

When the June chart for instance is your primary analysis source, ie., from January to
June, use it as your primary decision maker. From July to December use the Decem-
ber chart as your primary analysis tool. Along the way continue to confirm all findings
by double checking the spot chart and the secondary geometric chart.

THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO ADD TO THIS CHAPTER EXCEPT MORE ADVICE -

ONCE AGAIN!

Markets have a way of deceiving the majority of players, most of the time. Research
the past for a concrete understanding of what is possible, when history repeats itself
jump aboard. Sometimes you may need to sit aside for long periods, if this happens
make good use of your time, write a book or something just so you will keep your
mind on the job at hand. Markets move in several phases as we have discussed (ad-
vance, distribution, decline and accumulation), approximately 70% of the time they are
distributing or accumulating. When this action occurs markets tend to screw up your
long term projections, don’t deviate on an opinion unless overwhelming evidence
refutes your previous analysis. Set guidelines for price supports and resistances that
will reverse your opinion should they be broken. Most of all maintain your discipline
to remain flexible. When a position is working nicely stay on top of it, when it fails to
go your way step aside, don’t hope. Learn all of the methods and techniques outlined
in this book and apply common sense to your analysis, even if you fail to become a
“hot shot" trader your analysis services will be keenly sort after in the corporate arena,
this could be just as rewarding and less stressful, especially if you don’t have that ag-
gressive killer instinct a good trader requires and even thrives on.

Technical analysis is now a science - trading for profit is an art.

FIG 14.31 CURRENT POSITION AND FUTURE GOLD PROJECTIONS

The low registered on spot gold at the September equinox 1988 is proving to be a long
term market low. The only reservation I have is that the rally from September 26th to
December 3rd retraced 38.2% of the total decline December 1987 to September 1988.
This could indicate a fourth wave correction, meaning that we still require one more
down wave to complete the current bear market.. This market is dangerous if you
don’t keep in touch with it, so remain alert. If the trend line were to be broken, sup-
port would not be reached until the US$ 376 level basis spot and June contracts. Time
will not be over balanced until May 8-12th, 1989 (50% anniversary of the 1985-1987
bull market range).

Downside is limited, upside is unlimited. Major waves are vibrating to form a sig-
nificant high projection for early APRIL 1990. A minimum target for June gold is US$
576. Longer term projections indicate that gold will at least reach 1980 highs.

15. RULES FOR CONFIRMING IMPORTANT
MARKET VIBRATIONS

Market activity has three dimensions, TIME, PRICE AND SPACE. These "VIBRA-
TIONS" are graphically represented by the sides of a triangle that adhere to a sacred
geometric form.

As the circle or wheel of time continues forward, reactions to the past occur as both
time elapsed and price moved either attract or repulse themselves from one gravity
vortex to another.

The cycles of the universe are already programmed in nature, the cycles of 1 year, 1
month (lunar cycle), 1 day or 1 week should be considered as wheels within wheels.
The effects of these cycles will balance out in the longer term, yet along the way we
will see distortions or imbalance occur.

Market swing highs and lows are points in time, price and space where the
PSYCHOLOGICAL imbalance of supply and demand dictated by traders reaches its
zenith. The variables in the mathematical equation can fall into three categories, these
strict ratios are known as the trinity of trinities. A cycle move could be considered as
low to high and back to low or high to low and back to high. The ratio of time or price
or both to each wave movement should fall into one of three categories if it is to signal
a direct relationship of equality in degree.

The relationships known as the trinity of trinities are the divisions of 1 unit in ARITHMETIC,
HARMONIC and GEOMETRIC MEANS.

The ARITHMETIC MEANS of 1 are .333 and .666 (1 to 2).
The HARMONIC MEANS of 1 are .414 and .586 (1 to 1.414).

The GEOMETRIC MEANS of 1 are .382 to .618 (1 to 1.618).

TIME calculations that can balance vibrations of previous trends are measured by ex-
tending ratios of previous ranges or cycles, as well as high and low prices forward on
the chart Y axis.

Chp. 15 Page. 189
TIME PRICE & SPACE

PRICE calculations in terms of range retracements and projections, percentage in-
creases in value from lows and highs of importance, percentage decreases in value
from past highs of importance are all necessary to follow. These are easily plotted on
the chart X axis.

SPACE calculations are third dimensional and may not necessarily be easily recog-
nized.

The first important area to watch is specific times of the year which are historically im-
portant, static seasonal anniversaries such as Equinoxes, Solstices, Perigees and
Apogees, Solar eclipses and interplanetary aspects such as conjunctions and opposi-
tions.(see chapter 16 for further detailed explanation) Strangely these times can be con-
firmed usually by squarings of time of previous trend vibrations as they are repetitive
and cyclical in nature.

The second method of identifying space squarings are at the crossings of time and
price vibration angles of previous trends. Some may be quite obscure but as each in-
dividual method will confirm clusters at strong points in the future we should work all
methods in unison. It is not necessary that vibration angles actually pinpoint a price in-
tersection to be valid although if they do they are more convincing.

The third method of confirming a space squaring is when price or time of a previous
trend squares in reflection. Ie., a price range in units squares to the future in time. For
instance a previous trend may have advanced 144 points, when 144 days has elapsed
from the change in trend that price range will square 100%. Conversely a previous
trend may have lasted 144 days so that when the new trend has advanced or declined
144 points from its new beginning it will square price 100%. These methods of
monitoring space are extremely important and should not be discounted under any cir-
cumstances.

TIME AND PRICE VIBRATIONS of a move MUST SQUARE out in definite
proportions to past waves of SIMILAR DEGREE if they are to signal the completion
of that market phase and the beginning of a new trend.

IMPULSE WAVES generally expand and contract in direct relationship to the Golden
Mean (PHI 1.618) or 100% levels in time and price, ie 38.2%, 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%,
200%, 261.8% et cetera.

Chp. 15 Page. 190
TIME PRICE & SPACE

CORRECTIVE WAVES generally move in square ratios, ie 25%, 33.3%, 50% and
66.6% both in time and price.

OVERLAPPING CORRECTIVE WAVES in a move signal weakness of trend, these
are usually a forewarning of exhaustion and an imminent reversal. These formations
are commonly known as diagonal triangles.

CYCLES IN TIME OF TRENDS are not static, cycles expand and contract in direct
relationship to the subconscious involvement of traders. In a bull market phase correc-
tions will be much swifter and shallower as the expansion progresses. The same prin-
ciple applies in reverse to a fully fledged bear market. Bear markets start off fast then
make labouring protracted corrections before entering their final phase.

FILTER DAILY NEWS

It is most important that intermediate, primary and cycle time and price squarings are
accompanied by overbought or oversold sentiment readings. Besides using mathemati-
cal equations to monitor these conditions it is also important to actually identify them
in the true sense. Never act without thinking. Sometimes oscillators can remain over-
bought or oversold for weeks on end as a move virtually doubles previous gains, the
only filter will be your perception of the prevailing market strength. This area alone
could decide whether you win or lose when it comes to placing money on the line.

Let the market tell you where it is going, don’t you tell the market where it has to go.

THE MARKET WILL EVENTUALLY SQUARE IMPORTANT RATIOS OF
TIME AND PRICE WITH THE PAST, WHEN IT DOES AND YOU ARE COMFI-
DENT IT HAS! THEN TRADE- NOT BEFORE.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MARKET TURNING POINT OF IMPORTANCE
THAT I COULD NOT JUSTIFY TECHNICALLY, USING THE METHODS OF
TIME AND PRICE RATIO ANALYSIS.

This price retracement ratio is perhaps the strongest psychological force one will ever encounter.
This is an arithmetic mean - by adding the total value of the move up (in this case 110) and the
total move down (in this case 55) you have a total round trip of 165.

55 as a percentage of 165 = 33.3% : 110 as a percentage of 165 = 66.6%

TIME RELATIONSHIPS OF EXPANSIONS AND CORRECTIONS
MUST RELATE TO PAST WAVES OF SIMILAR DEGREE.

The major ratios of time are strictly determined using ancient geometry. The Circle,
Square and Golden Mean are the only means of explaining the irrational connection in
this regard.

Unity of a cycle is 1, 100% time periods forward from high to high or low to low that
mark a new high or low are convincing areas for a reversal of trend.

Because CYCLES ARE NOT ALWAYS STATIC, divisions and expansions of 1 in
strict natural ratios must always be monitored.

Most Important ratios are :-
PHI(1.618) and 1/PHI(0.618)
Square root of PHI = 1.272
Square root of 2 = 1.4142
Square root of 3 = 1.732
Square root of 4 = 2.000

Square root of 5 = 2.236

At every major turn in market trend a natural triangular relationship between time and
price will exist in strict ratios. These relationships may at first seem difficult to recog-
nize. Only study and a clear appreciation for the aesthetic side of the market will be
the answer to this problem. The right brain (which has the intellectual capacity to iden-
tify patterns in space) will recognize these situations once we have the knowledge, all
we need to do is convince the left brain (the emotive and analytic side of our intel-
ligence) that action is required.

The book "SACRED GEOMETRY" by Robert Lawlor. Goes into great depth explaining natural ratios
and their history, this should be considered a must for any student of market analysis.

TRACK UNFOLDING RATIOS OF CYCLES WITHIN CYCLES

Each completed two phase cycle, ie., High-low-high-low OR Low-high-low-high,
should contain relationships in waves of similar degree.

For instance if we were to label cycle turning points as A=start of first impulse,
B=first exhaustion point, C= reaction exhaustion point, D =end of next impulse.

Relationships in strict ratios could exist in the following way :-

PRICE RANGE OF WAVE C-D as a percentage of B-C range, A-B range or A-B + B-

C range. Price at point D as a percentage increase or decrease of price at points A, B
or C.

TIME RANGE OF WAVE C-D as a percentage of time range A-C, A-B or B-C.

Always investigate each option, waves may be impulsing or alternating depending upon
the market forces at work. Practical experience will guide you in the long term to ap-
preciate what is important.

16. HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY CYCLES

This book would not be a complete work unless I were to publish my findings in this
area. In modern times there has been a popular trend towards market analysis using
the age old art of astrology. Astro-economics as it is known remains in my view a sub-
jective subject. Although the basis of astrology, (the movement of the planets in their
respective cycles), holds an intriguing connection to the numbers and ratios put for-
ward earlier in this text.

I am not convinced from a market analysis viewpoint that one needs to know more
than the basics in this area as the methods and procedures already discussed will pin-
point areas for change in markets more precisely. In the interests of a better under-
standing of time cycles and human nature it is better to include this section rather than
leave it out.

Firstly, it would appear that the planetary positions are important in as much as the
psychological factor they generate. This alone warrants watching their progressions.
Astrology in its various forms is probably the most written about subject in this world.
Passed down through the ages, records of events have been connected with the aspects
of certain planets in the universe. Some aspects are interpreted as having favorable
meanings whilst others portray adverse meanings. The belief, by so many indivuals,
that planetary aspects have a bearing on the the day to day events causes one to at
least investigate this phenomena.

ASTRO ECONOMICS is the study of regular economic cycles as they relate to
planetary positions. Some schools of thought have devised ways of weighting
planetary aspects as either positive or negative, by using a cumulative total an oscil-
lator can be plotted and compared with the past. Future predictions are based on
past observations.

MUNDANE astrology is the study of planetary aspects for a particular place or in-
stitution, ie., a town, country, stock exchange et cetera. Astrologers prepare a birth
chart to interpret the future effects of planetary aspects in general relationship to
the masses of a town or country in a similar way to NATAL astrology.

HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY CYCLES

ELECTRO MAGNETIC FORCES

Scientific evidence exists to say that ELECTRO MAGNETIC forces surrounding the
EARTH?’s surface go through regular periods of change associated with the movement
of the MAJOR planets. The SUN SPOT cycle is also another area of interest to stu-
dents of ASTRO ECONOMICS. The SUN SPOT cycle goes through two phases in
each 22 3/4 year period, the popular belief that a cycle only lasts 11.11 years has been
disproved by Dr G. E. HALE who discovered the MASTER sun spot cycle. 2.5 cycles
is very close to 55 years and the KONDRATIEFF 54 year cycle, also 5 half cycles
make up an important harmonic vibration.

HELIOCENTRIC ASTRONOMY

From a scientific viewpoint and the study of cycles the approach I have made is in the
area of HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY POSITIONS. Heliocentric means the
relationship of the planets to the SUN. These cycles of planetary movement are not
distorted by retrogression of planets as occurs in GEOCENTRIC ASTRONOMY.
Geocentric astronomy tracks the position of the planets relative to the planet Earth.
One of course needs to keep an open mind as these periods of retrogression could
have some psychological effect on the masses, in fact some work to light compares the
stock market corrective cycles each year with the phases of retrogression experienced
by JUPITER and SATURN.

The planets of our universe, which is SUN centered, are positioned in the following
order:-

SUN - MERCURY - VENUS - EARTH - MARS - JUPITER - SATURN - URANUS - NEP-
TUNE - PLUTO

The relative distances of the planets from the SUN are measured in Astronomical
Units (A.U.), with one A.U. equal to the mean distance of the Earth to the Sun. The
exact distance of a planet from the Sun is called the Radius Vector by astronomers.
As each planet moves through its orbit around the Sun it travels in an ellipse, this
causes variations in its radius vector. The shortest radius vector is referred to as the
Perihelion of the planet whilst the Aphelion is the point of greatest distance from the
Sun. The shortest and longest distances are known as PERIGEE and APOGEE. As a
planet moves through each orbit its velocity varies in proportion to the area of the el-

Chp. 16 Page. 200
HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY CYCLES

lipse that it transits (KEPLERS LAW) and these velocities can be calculated with
amazing mathematical accuracy. The exact time of each orbit around the Sun is con-
stant yet the time of each transit through a star sign (12 signs of the Zodiac) will vary
depending upon the radius vector at that time. Planets travel at their slowest as they
approach their Aphelion and at their fastest as they approach their Perihelion. There
is some thought that planetary aspects that occur at times when velocity is at its
greatest have a stronger effect.

My current research is based on the planets VENUS, EARTH, MARS, JUPITER and
SATURN. To give you an idea of the variations in these planets velocity one needs to
understand the star signs that the progressions move through.

Looking from the Sun a planet will travel through 360 degrees for each full planetary
year, one orbit. If we assign 0 degrees to the entry point into ARIES (as viewed from |
the Sun) then each 30 degree progression will have the planet progressing into another
star sign. .

In order from 0 degrees ARIES we have TAURUS, GEMINI, CANCER, LEO,
VIRGO, LIBRA, SCORPIO, SAGITTARIUS, CAPRICORN, AQUARIUS and PIs-
CES. The orbit is complete as the phase has then returned to 0 degrees ARIES and
starts again. An EPHEMERIS plots the planets positions as viewed from 0 to 30
degrees of each star sign.

I have found that the average speed of a planet through each star sign will give its posi-
tion within +1 or -1 degree thus allowing simpler calculations to be made to find the
relative aspects of each planet to the Sun. I make my studies by viewing the planetary
aspects below a bar chart to determine if any regular price trends are associated with
the important aspects.

ORBITAL TIME -The actual time of the following planets orbits around the SUN are again as follows:-

VENUS 224.695 days (0.618 years)
EARTH 365.2403 days (1.000658 years)
MARS 686.936 days (close to 34x20)
JUPITER 4331.242 days or 11.86 years
SATURN 10736 days or 29.394 years

A quick observation will reveal that the Aphelion of EARTH occurs in the transit of
Capricorn (as viewed from the Earth the Sun would be in Cancer, this is between June
21 and July 22). The Perihelion of EARTH occurs in the transit of Cancer (as viewed
from the Earth the Sun would be in Capricorn, this is between December 22nd and
January 20).

SIMPLE PICTURE

If you could stand on the SUN and observe the rotations of the EARTH (heliocentric
astronomy) in relation to the INNER and OUTER planets you would at regular inter-
vals observe what is known as planetary CONJUNCTIONS and OPPOSITIONS. Con-
junctions are the times when the planets line up outwardly from the SUN, oppositions

Chp. 16 Page. 202
HELIOCENTRIC PLANETARY CYCLES

occur at times when the Sun is between two planets. There are other configurations
known as SEXTILE, SQUARE and TRINE used by astronomers. A planet is SEX-
TILE with another in heliocentric terms when the angle between the radius vectors
from the Sun are at 60 degrees. SQUARE is 90 degrees and TRINE is 120 degrees. I
feel from my research that other aspects such as 51.5 degrees SEPTILE (one seventh),
72 degrees PENTILE (one fifth) are areas that should be given consideration when
studying cycles.

Relationships of the planets in any of these values are said to form hard and soft
aspects. _OPPOSITIONS and SQUARE are said to be hard aspects, CONJUNC-
TIONS can be either hard or soft, SEXTILE and TRINE are soft aspects. Donald
Bradley in his book STOCK MARKET PREDICTION offers a table on the relative
meaning of planetary conjunctions.

The planetary conjunctions of the SUN and planets with which EARTH participates
are very regular in length and in fact Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto’s con-
junction cycles and opposition are between 13 months and 1 year.

Considering the number of OUTER planets that conjunct in roughly 1 year to 13
months or 55 weeks to 60 weeks or 367 to 400 days we have a solid foundation for the
annual cycle of market performance. Gann theory explicitly tells us to watch anniver-
saries of previous major turning points for a change of trend. Both astronomically and
psychologically these times have a sound basis.

Before we run off and program these time periods we must remember that these are
average times only. Because of the ellipse type orbits of the planets we have them
traveling faster and slower through their respective orbits as they are approaching their
perigee and apogee (closest and most distant from the Sun).

This of course means that cycle times for future conjunctions and oppositions will be ir-
regular. The correct manner of observation for these phenomena should be followed
by a table from a HELIOCENTRIC EPHEMERIS. THE AMERICAN
HELIOCENTRIC EPHEMERIS 1901-2000 prepared by Neil F. Michelsen is recom-
mended.

OBSERVATIONS THAT SUPPORT FURTHER STUDY IN THIS AREA

FIG 16.1 - DOW JONES HIGH 1987

As an aside it is worth mentioning that the DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE high that occurred
on August 25th 1987 at 2746.7 points intraday fulfilled a price projection target in Fibonacci degree
of 1.618 times the rise from 1932 to 1973. Many other time factors were present such as 55 years
from the 1932 low, 13 years from the 1974 low, 5 years from the 1982 low, what was absolutely
amazing was that the number of days from the BULL MARKET HIGH of September 3rd 1929 to the
high August 25th 1987 was exactly 21175 days or the square of 55 in weeks. 55x55 = 3025
3025x7 = 21175 55 as we know is a Fibonacci number and for two such important highs to fall to
an exact time period of a natural square is perplexing to say the least. Just the same what is even
more thought provoking is the fact that also on the 23rd, 24th and 25th of August 1987 we had an
EARTH SUN VENUS opposition, an EARTH SUN MARS opposition, a SUN VENUS MARS conjunc-
tion and a NEW MOON.

For a graphic picture of the planets positions at the time of the Dow high we can look at the follow-
ing charts.

GOLD MARKET DECLINE - 14th DECEMBER 1987 TO 26th SEPTEMBER 1988

Whilst | have been working on the manuscript for this book | have been actively trading the Gold
market. Its been very interesting following this decline and looking to pick the bottom. The low oc-
curred on Monday 26th, September 1988 at $391.50 basis Comex 1st month futures, $395.50 basis
Comex December futures and made a double bottom on the Comex June futures at $412.00 (a low
of $412.00 was made two days earlier on the Equinox). The ist month futures completed a 50%
retracement within $1.00 of the total rise from 1985 to 1987, December futures made a 61.8% retrace-
ment of the same rise. Two standard price and time angles on the December chart at 50 cents <é
week emanating from the February 1985 low and the 8th October 1986 intermediate high crossed ir
that week at $395.00. A week prior to the low day | addressed a small band of analysts at a WAVE
TRADER demonstration and alerted them to the time and price supports that were just around the

corner. It took most of them several weeks before they acknowledged the accuracy of this form of
analysis but | am used to that, in any case | positioned myself right at the bottom of the market and
that what counts.

If one is patient all the signals for an imminent trend change will be telegraphed at the
right time.

Using standard time and price procedures was ample in identifying this bottom. The total decline
lasted 287 calendar days (2x144), trading time was 198 (lucas series), the price decline of the last
wave down on the December contract was $89.50 (Fibonacci) and the three wave corrective forma-
tion adhered to a .382 and .618 relationship of GEOMETRIC mean which probably means that the
next rise will unfold in an ARITHMETIC or HARMONIC relationship (see Sacred Geometry by Robert
Lawlor page 84).

Insofar as the planetary observations were concerned the bottom was marked by a Mars-Earth-Sun
conjunction which would have been common knowledge to any student of astronomy.

What I found extremely interesting about the whole corrective phase was the relation-

If you look at the heliocentric overlay for the top on December 14th, 1987, (See FIG
16.5) you will see that Earth was SEPTILE Jupiter at a vector of 51.8 degrees (this is
the angle of inclination of the Great Pyramid of GIZA). Also Saturn was in orb of op-
position to Earth, we must not overlook that aspect.

Whilst working my way forward to investigate when Earth and Jupiter reach SEPTILE
again (I have a notion that the planetary cycles once in motion give a clear insight into
the workings of Fibonacci numbers and cycle ratios amongst other things), I came
across this planetary aspect on the 13th January 1989. Mars-Jupiter conjunction with
Venus in opposition. I was alerted to several important time squarings falling in the
Gold complex over the next week. This prompted an early issue of WAVE
TRADERS DIGEST on the 12th January, 1989, which stated, QUOTE "Decline that

began December 2nd, 1988 to end Monday 16th January 1989", "Maximum downside
target US$ 392 (basis spot) - double bottom with 26th September 1988".

The date of the next SEPTILE Earth-Jupiter was 17th January, 1989 and a period of
113 calendar days from September 26th, 1988. This time has balanced 100% of the last
wave down in the December 1987-September 1988 bear market. Wave (B)-(C) refer
FIG 16.3 page 204. On cue a series of lows came in throughout the early part of this
week at the US$ 400 level (basis spot), by Friday the 20th close, two days ago the
market had made a respectable rally to US$ 408.50. All momentum indicators have
now turned up.

My long term forecast for gold as you probably have read (Chapter 14, page 188) is for
Gold prices to enter an inflationary spiral, the next major squaring of time, in cycle de-
gree, will not be balanced until early April 1990. During the period from now until
then I expect to see fireworks in the Gold market and the financial system generally.

COMBINING PLANETARY CYCLES WITH CONVENTIONAL TIMING
AND ANALYSIS TOOLS

I have developed a practice of tracking heliocentric planetary cycles as a secondary
timing tool. I would never try using the planets as a stand alone tool to forecast market
highs and lows as some do; mostly with limited success. I have seen the same strong
planetary aspects coincide with major turning points in two entirely different markets,
the dilemma was that each market was trending in a different direction, one bearish
the other bullish. The end result was that they both reversed and both went on to
make extreme highs and lows. Who’s to say whether a particular planetary aspect is
hard or soft under those circumstances.

If you develop an opinion based on mere expectation of what an aspect may mean
(this is pure astrology) you leave yourself open to miss a profitable move.

WAVE FORM, MARKET SENTIMENT and GEOMETRY OF TIME AND PRICE
should be your primary guide to market direction. If the planets help identify a major
SUPPORT or RESISTANCE zone in TIME then all the better.

STUDY THE PLANETARY CYCLES AS A SCIENCE

Even if you never understand how to interpret planetary aspects you have lost nothing.
The knowledge of ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE will be lesson enough to enrich your
life.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, without it we are mere sheep. Sheep follow each other
unwittingly, they allow themselves to be manipulated, they feel comfort in numbers

and so long as they are all being treated the same, they are happy with their lot.

A Lion on the other hand is the master of his own destiny, he is a king, he can provide
for himself and has no equal. The king of the jungle controls his own realm.

We live in a financial jungle.

GEOMETRY OF MARKETS - EPILOGUE

Understanding this text may at first seem difficult and complex to new students. I can
assure you, you will become a LION in regards to the financial markets, if you can
grasp the principles outlined in GEOMETRY OF MARKETS. The techniques of
analysis put forward here are within the grasp of any human being, given that they
apply themselves and work for the knowledge. I wish I could have had an introduction
such as this, it certainly would have saved me many years of hard work.

Trading commodity and stock markets for profit is akin to competing in a formula one
motor racing championship. If you have the best car, any mishaps can only be due to
your own lack of control and incompetence.

A champion driver smooths out the course by anticipating, when to accelerate, when to
slow down. A novice or fool bounces from kerb to kerb until he either learns the cir-
cuit or the wheels fall off.

Spectators who have little knowledge of the skills involved, watch on, never realizing
the work and effort a champion must go to in fulfilling his ambitions. I have realized
this and so should you, hard work, study, common sense and dedication is the only
answer.

The competition is ever changing, we must adapt to each new environment if we are
to succeed. Every course is a little different, constant pressure is upon us to calculate
the odds and act accordingly.

To be a winner we must be trained and knowledgable, we must also be flexible and
evaluate future events using known experiences from the past.

There are only three ingredients required for success, these are KNOWLEDGE - ABILITY
- APPLICATION.

Good luck and successful trading,
