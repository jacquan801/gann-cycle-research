INTRODUCTION

If one is very fortunate, once in a lifetime a eureka moment strikes.
Following in the footsteps of W.D. Gann, in search and discovery of the
Universal Clock is such a moment. However, the word ‘moment’ should
be replaced by ‘years.’

1 believe that W.D. Gann used the Universal Clock for his personal
trading and for most of his now famous predictions. The Clock
functions as a Master Timing Device. The easy proof of this is the fact
that his predictions pan out accurately on the Universal Clock.

Book | is intended to introduce the reader to the multifaceted use of
the Universal Clock. It is but part of a mammoth research project. This
book contains my major discoveries, after being seriously involved for
some 30 years in Astronomy, Astrology, Archaeoastronomy and 12
years in the Futures Markets. Each chapter, in fact, describes a very
different tool. Each chapter has been a step along a multi-year foumey.
Yet they are from the sare Universal toolbox.

To obtain the maximum benefit from this book, study and work with
each chapter ONE AT A TIME. Until you master, not just the concept,
but the actual workings of each individual technique. If you try to
understand and use all the tools at once, only confusion and frustration
will result.

Those of you who are prepared to put in the effort required to master
these new (ancient) discoveries, wil! find rewards beyond your
expectations. (Like everything else in life; nothing succeeds like
purpose, effort and perseverance!) Traders and analysts who truly
want to understand how the Universal Clock works must make sure that
chapters 4 & 5 are totally clear to you before you aitempt using the
information to forecast Time and Price. All six Astrotechniques covered
in this book “work” in the Real Market Place. | use them in my trading, in
combination with my own valid technical tools. 1 suggest you do the
same,

Book 1! will expand on the examples shown here and go into greater
detail on the specifics of timing.

The words that are capitalized throughout the book are meant to draw
your attention to that word or point.

The symbols used at the beginning and ending of each chapter
range from early pictograms to Classical Sumerian, Old-Babylonian and
Neo-Babylonian cuneiform script. The word ‘star’ in Classical Sumerian
cuneiform is used to start Chapter 1.

The W.0. Gann quotations are mostly from his book “Tunnel Thru
The Air.”

| have really tried to make these discoveries and information practical
and usable. | hope you will find it as heipful in your trading as | do.
CHAPTER 1

FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF W.D. GANN

By studying past history and knowing that the future is but a repetition of the past,
you can determine the cause according to the time and condition, Sometimes it is necessary
fo go a long way back to determine the cause. WD. Gann.

In the early part of this century the famous market trader W.D. Gann spent a number of
years traveling in Europe and India in search of the Holy Grail.

His attention was focused on ancient geometry and archaeoastronomy. A good portion of
time was spent at the British Museum in London studying Egyptian artifacts and Sir Leonard
Woolley’s discoveries from the ancient city of Ur in Mesopotamia. Of special interest were the
clay tablets with astronomical writings. From these tablets he gained some major insighis into
archeoastronomy and its relationship to price and time. Most of his discoveries regarding this
material was never revealed to the general public. {tis only through backtracking that the true
story finally unfolds.

In order to understand how W.D. Gann made certain market predictions and how he
developed his ideas, | followed in his footsteps. In 1991 | went to the British Museum to view
the Egyptian displays and the artifacts from Ur, some dating from around 5000 years ago. Like
W.D. Gann, of special interest to me were the clay tablets with the cuneiform writings
describing the astronomical phenomena of the time. These tablets not only gave the
planetary information but also predicted the events expected to occur at the specific time.
Some tablets referred to the price of wheat in relationship to the planets Mercury and the Sun.
It immediately became clear to me how W.D. Gann saw this as repetition of similar conditions,
repetition of cycles and even repetition of price.

My first step on the road to discovery was to check out the Mercury/Sun dates in
relationship to price. However, at that time | was not trading wheat and therefore not familiar
with its particular trading patterns. My favorite commodity is soybeans so | quickly put all the
Mercury/Sun dates on my soybeans charts. To my surprise | found that the Mercury/Sun
dates did indeed have a great deal in common with price.

For example, | noted the price of soybeans on a Mercury/Sun date and then noted price
on the next Mercury/Sun date. With amazing regularity the price was the same. The
relationship of Mercury/Sun to the price works just the same in the 1990’s as it did 5000 years
ago when those clay tablets were written!

See Chart 1A.
All dates marked with an arrow on Chart 1A are Mercury/Sun dates. The first thing that
stands out about these dates, in fact hits you right in the eye, is that price on dates A and B are
the same and price on dates C and D are also the same! In other words, the trading ranges of
dates A and B overlap. The same is true of dates C and OD.

The Mercury/Sun dates work in pairs, how these pairs form will be discussed later in this™
chapter. The fact that they do work in pairs means that once you know the price range of date
A, you then automatically know the price range of date B, which occurred six weeks later in this
example. The same is true to dates C and D. Date D occurred approximately 8 weeks after
date C, therefore at the close of trading on date C, you could then predict the price range for
cate D.

The bottom line is that once you have the price range of dates A and C, you also have the
price range for dates B and D.

Besides amazing your friends by forecasting price on certain dates, how can this
information be used to assist trading? Firstly, note how price had moved up over a period of
two weeks prior to date B. Therefore, two weeks prior to date B, with the knowledge that price
had to move up approximately 15¢ by date B, indicates that you wouid definitely be looking to
buy. Any reasonable technical system can be used to initiate a buy signal in the 510 area.
Profit could be taken on date B in the 520 to 525 area. Or if you are confidant with your
technical exit signals, you can use them to exit the trade at the appropriate area.
Date D could have been traded in exactly the same manner. Your favorite technical tools
would have initiated a buy approximately one week prior to date D. The knowledge that price
will be trading in the 510 to 513 range on date D, enabled an order to be put in for profit to be
taken in that predicted range on date D.

The above suggestions for trading are just that - suggestions. They are used to give
examples of ways to take advantage of this material. | certainly do not recommend trading the
predicted dates without a valid technical system to ensure proper entry and exit signals.
However, when combined with your favorite technical tools, predicted dates can prove to be
extremely valuable. As you proceed through the book you'll find the predictability of dates on
certain other commodities truly valuable for trading options too.

The future Mercury/Sun dates are easily found in a book called an ephemeris. 100 years
of planetary listings are available for the small price of $19.95. A more informative ephemeris
for 10 years (1990-2000) is available for the novice for $9.95. How to read an ephemeris and
where to buy one is discussed in Chapter 2.

How to determine Mercury/Sun dates.

MERCURY/SUN CYCLE
The relationship of Mercury/Sun on dates used for price repetition on the Soybeans.

This illustration shows a frozen moment in time. When viewed from Earth
(Geocentrically} Mercury and the Sun appear to be together in the sky. This is known as a
conjunction of Mercury and the Sun. The dates of the Mercury/Sun conjunctions are the

dates used to predict price and time. Each arrow on Chart 1A is the date of a Mercury/Sun
conjunction.

There are two types of conjunctions, the Superior and the Inferior. One of each of these
two types of conjunctions make up the pair used in the Soybean examples. The Superior
conjunction sets up the first date, while the Inferior conjunction sets up the second date.

The following illustration shows the Mercury/Sun cycle for 1993. At point A, Mercury is in
a conjunction with the Sun (Jan. 23, 1993). in the following days Mercury moves forward,
ahead of the Sun to point B. Mercury is now at the tarthest distance from the Sun that it will
get in this part of the cycle. {It can at times be almost 28° away, as for example, at the
beginning of April 1993}. At point B, Mercury reversed direction and moves backwards
towards the Sun, At this time, when viewing Mercury from Earth (Geocentrically), it appears to ~
have a backwards motion which is called Retrograde" motion. Mercury makes a second
conjunction with the Sun at point C (March 8, 1993}, while still in Retrograde motion. Now
Mercury falls behind the Sun to point D, where it appears from Earth to start moving forward
again, called Direct motion. From paint D, Mercury will move forward to the conjunction with

the Sun and to répeat the whole cycle again.

For simplicities sake, on this iHustration (and on the example Charts 1A to 1D), | have

called the Direct (Superior) conjunction at A, #1. The Retrograde (|nferior) conjunction at C is

#2. The price on the #2 conjunction date is compared to the price on the #1 conjunction he |

in all of the Soybean illustrations. The price range on the #1 conjunction date will predict the
price range for the #2 conjunction date.

There are approximately 6 Mercury/Sun conjunctions per year, since we are comparing
pairs this gives 3 pairs of conjunctions in all. This then only affords 3 opportunities per year to
predict price when using the Mercury/sun conjunction. However, many other planetary
combinations can be used to predict additional prices. This information will be clearty
illustrated in the following chapters.

* Retrograde: From time to time Mercury appears to be moving backwards, called Retrograde
motion. Mercury never actually moves backwards in its orbit around the Sun. However, when
Mercury is viewed from the Earth, Geocentrically it has a periodic apparent backwards motion
due to the fact that ihe Earth is also moving.
The easiest way to visualize this phenomena is to think in terms of two moving trains.
When the faster train passes a slower train going in the same direction, the slower train, fora
short period of time, has an apparent backwards motion. Even though the slower train never
actually moves backwards, it appears to do so. The exact same thing happens with the

planets. All of the planets except the Sun, when viewed Geocentrically (from Earth) can have
Retrograde periods.

NATURAL CYCLES

What we are actuaily tuning in to can be called the natural cycles of planets and therefore
the natural cycles of price. Planetary cycles are of unequal length, making them extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to discover without the astronomical information to define them.

Once the planetary dates are determined the predictable dates of the natural price cycles
are no longer a mystery.

W.D. Gann wrote quite extensively on cycles of equal length, such as the 90 day cycles or
the 144 day cycles. However, he never mentioned unequal length cycles, even though some
of his predictions of future prices clearly demonstrate he was using these unequal cycles.

CYCLES OF EQUAL LENGTH
Easy to identify

— —- . —— ee

ri ee ee

Se ee eee OO re

CYCLES OF UNEQUAL LENGTH
Difficult to identify. Natural cycles like market cycles are of unequal length.

Further examples of the Mercury/Sun price cycles are shown on the following charts. In
illustration 1B, once the trading range has been established on date one, we can then predict
the trading range on date two. Note that price traded up as high as 625 approximately two
weeks prior to date 2. Knowing price had to trade at 540 to 553 two weeks tater certainly
should have enabled the trader to sell Soybeans with a technical signal somewhere near 610.
What a deal! To know in advance that the market was going to make a 60¢ move. Profit could
easily be taken on predicted date 2. Or if you are using a good technical system, you would
probably wait for your exit signal to occur at a lower level before you were out of the trade.

Chart 1D illustrates that on the close of June 17 (date 1} the price range was 607 to 614.
Immediately we could predict the price range for 9 1/2 weeks later on August 21! The price
movements on this chart after June 17 were extremely volatile. However, with the expectation
of price reaching 607 to 614 objective long before August 21 the lows in July could have
been bought with your favorite technical tools. Since price reached the 607 to 614 objective
long before August 21, and shot through it to new highs, you would obviously be looking for a
technical signal to sell with the anticipation of price dropping back to the predicted level by
August 21. Price then shot down through this jevel long before the predicted date, now
indicating that you had to look to buy any technical signal that brought price back to the
predicted range by August 21. In other words, once date 1 has occurred, anytime price
swings a considerable distance away from the predicted price range for date 2, you must use
your technical signais to take trades in the direction of the predicted price level. Often, as
shown on Chart 1D, several profitable trades are achieved. It is imperative to use a technical
system with proper entry and exit points to take advantage of these types of swings, as there
are a few occasions when the price of Soybeans does not meet the expected range on date
2. This does not mean that suddenly our planetary cycles have fallen over and stopped
working. In fact, it is quite the contrary. You will find on these occasions that geometrically and

mathematically price is still right on target. Full details of changing price levels will be covered
in Chapter 4.

So far | have covered the Mercury/Sun conjunctions only. | have also exptained that the
conjunctions are easy to locate, because they are listed in the ephemeris. However, in the
beginning the ancient astronomers did not have the luxury of a book listing the planetary
conjunctions. They had to do it the hard way, they had to look up at the heavens and visually
find the planetary phenomena.

What they saw at the time of a Mercury/Sun conjunction was that Mercury seemed to
disappear into the glare of the Sun, and become invisible. A couple of days later Mercury
reappeared out of the glare of the Sun, this was cajled the ‘heliacal’ rising of Mercury. The
disappearance was called the heliaca! setting. So in actual fact the ancients did not see the
conjunctions.

The ancient astronomers/astrologers used the heliacal rising and setting dates as the
signals to predict events. The heliacal rising of mercury for example occurs one to two days
following the Mercury/Sun conjunction. | have found that the conjunction dates seem to give
the repetitions of price more accurately in today’s markets. Although, as you will quickly notice
when you work with this information, price often comes into the predicted range on the day
before the conjunctions, or is frequently stil! in the predicted range the day after the
conjunction. This certainly takes the heliacal risings and settings into account. More
information on the 3 day period around the conjunction date is given in this chapter under
‘Requirements for overlapping price ranges’.
REQUIREMENTS FOR OVERLAPPING PRICE RANGES

By . ;

A B Cc D

Each of the above examples constitute an overlap of the two price ranges of date 1 and 2.
When predicting the price range on date 2, you will simply state the price range of date 1.
However, date 2 will seldom be the exact same range as date 1. Price range on date 2 can
form in any one of the examples shown above. (A, B, C or D.) But the price on date 2 must
touch some part of the range of date 1, even if it is only the low of the day 2 touching the high
of day 1.

Often you will find that price comes into the predicted range on the day before day 2. Or
price will still be in the predicted range on the day after date 2. Therefore, within the 3 day time
frame, price generally trades completely through the predicted range. The reason for this is
that the planetary signal does not always occur during trading hours on day 2. | can happen
atter trading hours, or even in the middle of the night. The ephemeris lists the exact time that
the two planets come into alignment.

| strongly advise that the novice of astronomical phenomena does not complicate life by
worrying about pinpointing the actual time of the Mercury/Sun conjunction on date 2. Just
know that price comes into the predicted range on date 2, and that more often than not, price
will trade through the predicted range between the 3 day period of day before, day of and day
after the Mercury/Sun conjunction (date 2).

The complications the beginner encounters by trying to pinpoint the exact time, is that
the planets in our solar system do not function in a vacuum. There are often other
connections between planets occurring on date 2. On this date, for example, say the
Mercury/Sun conjunction is at 8:20am, then later that same day, say at 3:15pm, the Moon
moves into an alignment with the Mercury/Sun conjunction, this would alter the timing for the
original Mercury/Sun conjunction. This additional information with the Moon is good to know if
you are trading intraday. However, for predicting price ranges on dates several weeks in
advance, the additional information can more often than not be confusing. The bottom line is
that your ability to take advantage of the predicted dates is not in the least bit hampered by just
taking the day rather than the exact hour and minute of date 2.

When the predicted date 2 falls on a weekend, the following rules are helpful. If the
predicted date is a Saturday, expect to see price come into the predicted range on Friday. If
Sunday is the predicted date, look to Monday for price to come into the predicted range. But
you will not be surprised to find that with great regularity, both Friday and Monday prices trade
in the predicted range. This confirms our 3 day range information previously discussed.

CHAPTER 2

THE ARCHAEOASTRONOMY LEGACY

This makes it plain that everything works according to past cycles, and that history repeats itself.
WD. Gann.

Man has a long history of observing the sky and planets. It is impossible to determine just
when the observations actually began, but bone markings from prior to 10,000 BC suggests
notation of Moon cycles.

The study of the heavens was not isolated. It developed in China, India, Egypt, Britain and
Mesopotamia. However, it is the astronomical/astrological data inherited from the
Mesopotamians that laid the foundations for the modern western astrology that we use today.

in Mesopotamia, around 8000 BC, the beginnings of cereal cultivation was underway inthe
fertile alluvial basin between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. This area is the sight of modern
Iraq.

The ancient farmers realized that it was beneficial for agriculture to keep track of time by
observing the stars. They found that the heliacal risings and settings of the stars and planets
could easily be correlated with the time of the year.

By 5000 BC the expanding population of the early Mesopotamian inhabitants led to the
building of cities and the development of crafts, pottery and metalwork, and so civilization was
born. Record keeping by the Sumerians of Southem Mesopotamia began somewhere around
3500 BC. Clay tablets were used to document sales of cattle or crops, first in pictographic signs
and later in cuneiform script. Tablets with astronomical data chronicled the omens for the King
and nation. Although the Sumerians political power failed by 2000 BC, fortunately their
astronomicaV/astrological practices were not lost, but were absorbed into the Babylonian
culture.

Over the next several thousand years the Babylonians refined and expanded their
astronomical/astrological knowledge. The cuneiform writings onclay tablets detailed astrologi-
cal omens that not only predict specific events for
the King, but also foretold dates of plagues, fires,
crop growth or failures and even predict future
crop prices. Many of these tablets have survived
the rigors of time and can be seen today in
museums around the world. The clay tablet | saw
inthe British Museum was much smaller than the
one illustrated below. It described the astronomi-
cal event as the heliacal rising of Mercury. It
predicted the price of wheat in terms of what was
in the past will be in the future.

BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM

It is not necessary to do an indepth study of astronomy/astrology to use the information in
this book. You need to do only two things. First, familiarize yourself with the planets in the
. solar system. Be aware that for the exercise in this book, the planets work in pairs. | have
already given examples of the Mercury/Sun pair and in the following chapters | will illustrate
more other planetary pairs. The second requirement is to be able to find the predicted dates
for the various planetary pairs. This can be easily done by using the ‘Trader's Astrological
Almanac,’ it’s written especially for Traders who have little or no knowledge of
astronomy/astrology.

On the example page of the 1993 Trader's Astrological Almanac below, the Mercury/Sun
conjunction is listed in a very clear fashion on January 23, 1993. For the convenience of the
trader, all times, where times are listed are given in Eastern Standard Time. As you can see
there is a lot of planetary information on this page. You'll also find clear instructions of how to
use it.

The Trader's Astrological Almanac, which is published yearly, lists all of the aspects for
each year. For more extensive research the American Ephemeris, compiled by Neil F.
Michelsen, comes in 10 year increments. This can be ordered from Astro Communications
Services, P.O. Box 34487, San Diego, CA 92163. You may tor example, want to order 1981
to 1990 and 1991 to 2000, combined they will give ample opportunity for past and future
research. Do not order the 100 year Ephemeris unless you have astrological knowledge as
this one does not list the aspects daily, you have to calculate them for yourself!

On the following page is an example of an ephemeris page from the back of the 1993
Trader's Astrological Almanac. This page not only lists the date of the Mercury/Sun
conjunction on January 23, 1993, but also lists all other planetary relationships during the
month of January. Under the Daily Aspectarian section, the time of 3:43pm given for the
Mercury/Sun conjunction on January 23, is Greenwich Mean time.

The planetary information in the ephemeris is given using the planetary symbols. It is
necessary to learn the symbols in order to use the ephemeris efficiently. You will find the
symbols detailed under the next section subtitled ‘All About the Solar System.’

Chapter 3 will discuss the need for the ‘Daily Aspectarian’ section at the bottom of the
ephemeris page. This section lists all relationships (like Mercury conjunct Sun) between all of
the planets for a period of one month. In a later chapter we will be looking for a specific
relationship between pairs of planets. A quick scan of the Aspectarian section will give the
dates any planets contacted each other during that month. Once you recognize the symbols,
it then becomes very easy to use the wealth of information the ephemeris presents.

For those who do not want to learn this new planetary language, all is not lost! Computer
software is available and will print out planetary data in plain English. You'll find a list of software
vendors at the back of this book

The Trader's Astrological Almanac for 1993 and 1994 is available from P.A.S., Inc., 757
SE 17th St., #272, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33316.

The format of the ephemeris pages in the Trader's Astrological Almanac is exactly the
same as the format in the 10 year ephemeris.

GEOCENTRIC VIEW OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Geocentric means Earth centered. The geocentric planetary positions show where the
planets are placed in the solar system when they are viewed from Earth. The planets on the
example ephemeris page are geocentric positions. The symbols of the planets, as shown
below, are the same as the ones you will find on the ephemeris pages.

There are 8 planets in our solar system plus the Sun and the Moon as well as our own
planet Earth, making 11 in all. Eleven planets afford a multitude of combinations of pairs.
Since they are all traveling at different speeds, the planetary combinations set up a variety of
time cycles.

This book is all about correlating the natural cycles of the planets to the natural cycles of
price. Just as each commodity has its own peculiar characteristics, so does each planet. Itis
for this very reason, that one certain planetary pair will play an important role in creating the
repetition of price for a specific commodity. Soybeans, as we have already seen, relate well to
the Mercury/Sun pair. The British £ has close ties with Mercury/Satum.

The Mercury/Saturn cycle with the British £ functions somewhat differently to the
Mercury/Sun cycle with Soybeans. For example, there are approximately six Mercury/Sun
conjunctions per year, while there is only one Mercury/Saturn conjunction. When using
Mercury/Saturn it becomes necessary to have a whole series of other contacts between the
two planets, since one contact per year has little value for the trader. The contacts are called
‘aspects.’ There is a whole series of aspects that two planets can make with each other as they
move through the 360 degrees (one full circle). The series start with the conjunction and

ends at the next conjunction.
For example, after two planets make a conjunction, the faster planet (Mercury) then

moves quickly away from the slower planet (Saturn), as they continue their orbits. As they
separate they make a series of aspects to each other. See examples below,

1. Conjunction 2. Semi-Sextile 3. Sextile 4. Square

Mercury
Mercury Mercury Mercury

The inconjunct #8 is the same as the inconjunct #6. Making 7 aspectsin all. The aspects
repeat after the opposition in order of the inconjunct, trine, square, sextile, semi-sextile and
back to the conjunction where the whole cycle starts all over again. All 7 aspects were used to

determine the dates on Charts 2A through 4C.

The above demonstrates aspects between Mercury and Saturn, but any pair of planets
can be used in exactly the same way. For example, the same 7 aspects were used with the

Sun and Pluto on the Oil Charts examples 6A to 6D.
ASPECT SERIES

360° = 1 circle

As you can see, the aspects fall at regular intervals. The circle is divided up into segments
of 30. The divisions or aspects are always the same, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° and 180°.

60° — Sextile Symbol >

120° ‘Trine Symbol AA
150° Inconjunct Symbol 7

The symbols for the aspects shown on this page, along with the symbols for the planets

illustrated on page 14, are to be used when looking up planet positions and aspects in the
ephemeris.
CHAPTER 3

PRICE REPETITION PATTERNS

In order to forecast future cycles, the most important thing is to begin right, for if we
have the right beginning, we will get the right ending. If we know the cause of the effect
there can be no doubt about predicting future event or effect. W.D. Gann

The Soybean examples in Chapter 1 correlated with the Mercury/Sun cycles, which is a
simple cycle, with an uncomplicated pattern, therefore easy to understand. All agricutturals
(Wheat, Corn, Soybeans, things of the Earth) follow the natural cycles and work well with the
simple patterns of the Mercury/Sun relationship.

Other commodities are much more complex therefore the cycles are also more complex.
instead of just conjunctions as used with Mercury/Sun, it now becomes necessary to use the
whole series of aspects between two planets as discussed in Chapter 2. For the currency
charts (British £, Deutsche Mark and Swiss Franc) the Mercury/Saturn pair creates price
tepetition dates. All 7 aspects between this pair are used. This offers about one date per
month. (Just to clarify, whenever Mercury and Saturn are 30° away from each other, or in
multiples of 30° from each other an aspect is formed.) The aspect dates equal price repetition
dates.

See example Chart 2A, British £, March 1992 futures contract. All Mercury/Saturn dates
are marked with an arrow. On this chart we have the simple 1-2 format, exactly the same as we
saw on the Soybeans. Price repeats on date 2. How do you know which is the first date and

which is the 2nd date when putting planetary data on your own charts? Quite simply, after
inserting 6 or 7 dates, you will immediately see the pattern and be able to follow it on from
there. The dates of course, are found in the Almanac or the ephemeris. At the end of the
book ! will list some computer programs that give printouts of planetary data for those who
don’t care to look up the planetary positions manually.

Chart 2B, British £ is not as clear cut as Chart 2A with a simple 1-2 format. This is where
the more complex patterns surface. The arrows have been marked M.N.O.P. Notice that M
and N are the 1-2 format while O and P are not. If you now look to Chart 2C, which is a
continuation of 2B, you will see that the 1-2 format has now turned into a 1-2-3 format with O,
P and Q. Note that P lines up with M and N and Q lines up with O. This type of pattern is not
an aberration, it forms with some regularity, but fortunately the 1-2 format is the most common
pattern. Chapter 7 gives information on when to expect the development of the 1-2-3 format.

There are other factors that occasionally create aberrations in market patterns. These
include man’s desire to manipulate the currencies (especially the Japanese Yen). However,
even under these conditions the natural cycles always win in the end.

The 1-2 format is back again at R and S on Chart 2C. Fortunately, the 1-2 format occurs
with sufficient regularity, so that if you never did any further study of this book, just used the
predicted date information alone, you would be correct with your predicted dates 70% of the
time.

The predicted dates work even better on the cash charts. | have included a supplement
of 6 cash currency charts. These can be taped together (something that cannot be done with
futures charts) into a long term chart. In this way you'll have an even better understanding of

the development of the planetary cycles and the geometric patterns that form over the jong
term.

| have used futures charts in the book mainly because | personally trade the futures
markets as do most of my trading friends. All of my research is done on the futures charts too.
Therefore, for people in the U.S. these charts are extremely useful. Many of my overseas
trading friends work in the cash markets, especially cash currencies, so the supplement charts
will be extremely useful to them. However, as you work through the book you will realize the
importance of viewing the long term picture and planetary patterns. In other words, there is
more to this than just the 1-2 format, which is just the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately, you will see
that certain 1-2 formats relate to other 1-2 formats, creating repetitions within repetitions within

repetitions. This information will be discussed at length with the DOW Jones Industrial
Averages charts.

You could have made three perfect price predictions on the 2nd date of these examples.
Char 2E again gives the simple 1-2 tormat we ail love to see.

While Chart 2F does not cooperate, it forms part of a series of 1-2-3 formats.

Deutsche Mark and Swiss Franc
Mercury/Saturn dates also work extremely well for price repetition on the Deutsche
Mark and the Swiss Franc as the following charts clearly demonstrate.

Chart 3A illustrates the Deutsche Mark with the simple 1-2 format at E and F while an even
more complex pattern forms at G, H, 1 and J. This new format is a 1-2-3-4 pattern. You can see
this 1-2-3-4 format again on Chart 3B. Looked at in the context of long term charts, the
1-2-3-4 format will become clear. In other words, if you put five years of repetition dates on the
cash Deutsche Mark charts you will see the major jong term patterns forming and will then
know how often the 1-2-3-4 format occurs in the overall pattern. | have tried to make a simple
presentation. This was easy to do with the 1-2 format. However, the other formats which
occur 25% of the time, are not simple. They are complex formats and can only be understood
by studying the long term repetitions and by the information given in Chapter 7.

Chart 3C is a very simple 1-2 format. Chart 3D gives the 1-2-3-4 pattern again.

Chart 5E is a series of 1-2 patterns, but notice how the pairs often relate back to previous
pairs. The long term cash charts show clear examples of price year after year coming backto.
the same areas on repetition dates. This is very important for future prediction of correct
prices.

The Oil Charts 6A, B, C and D show examples of 1-2 tormats and 1-2-3-4 pattern. The
planetary pair for Oil is Sun/Pluto.

HELPFUL HINTS

Some clues to help you with repetition dates.
1. When price starts moving to new high or low price levels, after several months of not
trading at those levels, look back to the last repetition dates in the area price is now moving
into. Example at A shows the last repetition dates in the same price area.

A B
— _ an
i -
1 2 in | I" 2
| 0 lly a,
and date 2 |
1 2

You will find that price at B will correspond to price at A. This means that under these
circumstances, you can actually predict the price on date 1 {B) which you have never done
before! And of course, you can predict price on date 2! This is the true benefit of looking
back over the longer term.

2. Chapter 4 also provides information on prices moving up and down to new levels.

3. Chapter 7 illustrates the individual aspects, showing which ones most often pair up to
create repetitions with other price repetitions.

CHAPTER 4

THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK

In making my predictions I use geometry and mathematics, just as the astronomer does,
based on immutable laws. W.D. Gann.

The ancient Mesopotamians figured out the measurements of time and space. Their
measurements were based on the 360° circle and the 24 hour day, both of which are still used
today. W.D. Gann recognized the importance of 360 and 24, not only from his studies of the
Babylonians, but also from his indepth studies of mathematics and geometry. He wrote about
the “24 Revolutions of Time and Price” in relationship to the 360° turn of the Earth, and
devised a wheel based on 360 and 24, see illustration below. He called this wheet his “Price
and Time Chart.” Gann stated that the wee) should be used for grains, wool and stocks.

er

W.D, Gann’s
Price and Time Wheel
for Grains and Wool

However, after several years of working with this particular wheel, | have found that it works for
allcommodities and stocks. I'm not surprised that Gann left so little information about how to
use the wheel, since it was probably his own personal trading instrument.

W.D. Gann's wheel is a very complex calculator without instructions. At the same time the
numbers on the wheel are difficult to see and read, thereby rendering it almost useless to the
average trader. In order to make the wheel more user friendly, | have not only simplified it, but
have given clear details of how to use it too. | have called the new wheel the “Universal Clock”
because that is what it really is.

The Universal Clock is based on the movements of the Earth and the movements of the
planets in our solar system. The Universal Clock has a daily, monthly and yearly timer, similar to
the clock we use every day which has divisions of hours, minutes and seconds.

The daily timer on the Universal! Clock is based on the Earth’s rotation of 360° in 24 hours.
The yearly timer is based on the Earth making one complete trip around the Sun in one year.
In other words the Earth travels 360° in 365 days. (It appears to us here on Earth that the Sun
is moving around the Earth, while the Earth appears to be standing still, when in fact just the
opposite is happening.)

DAILY CLOCK YEARLY CLOCK
360°
Earth
200 @)
Earth
365 days

360° = 1 day
15° = = hour 360° = 365 days*
1° = 4minutes 1° = approximately 1 day

(* 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes
and approximately 46 seconds,
we add 1 day every 4 years to
align the yeariy clock.)

The Earth's daily rotation is 360° in 24 hours, 15° in 1 hour, 1° in 4 minutes. This makes
360, 24, 15 and 4 very important key numbers. They have other uses besides the ones
described in this book. They can be used for price counts as well as day counts. They create
natural cycles of even length, W.D. talked about those particular cycles with regularity. Use the
numbers to multiply or divide with. Or just try a 4 minute bar chart and you'll see what | mean.
In order to complete the Universal Clock it is necessary to combine the daily clock with the
yearly clock. This is done in exactly the same way as the hours, minutes and seconds are
combined on a regular clock. For example, even though the face of the regular clock is
numbered 1 through 12, it actually covers a 24 hour period. Therefore, it is necessary to go
twice around this clock in order to cover the full 24 hours. This twice around the clock clearly
explains how to combine the daily and yearly time frames on the Universal Clock. The basic
face of the Universal Clock is numbered 1 to 24, which means there must be fifteen trips
around to reach the 360 of the yearly clock.

INNER WHEEL/TIME WHEEL

The numbers 1 through 24 move in a counter clockwise direction on the Universal Clock,
this is the same direction the Earth travels around the Sun. Inthe Universal Clock illustration,
Figure 4, note that the ist circle is numbered 1 to 24. The second circle 25 to 48. The 3rd
circle is 49 to 72, and so on, until 15 circles are completed and 360 is reached.

These 15 circles are called the ‘inner wheel of the Universal Clock. The inner wheel is the
planetary wheel or planetary clock, it is also the Time wheel. Chapter 5 will demonstrate how to
place the planets into the inner wheel in order to correlate with price. Before moving to that
point however, it is necessary to construct the Price wheel or outer wheel. This will be the

~ Price Clock.

| have separated the Price Wheel from the Time Wheel, W.D. Gann had both Price and
Time on the same wheel. The reason for separating the Time Wheel from the Price Wheel is

to minimize contusion when using the wheel. It also clearly establishes when time and Price
come together.
HOW TO CONSTRUCT THE PRICE WHEEL

The prices of commodities and stocks etc., will be determined by the numbers in the
outer price wheel. A space is left between the ending of the inner wheel and the starting of
the outer wheel. The numbers are then inserted into the ist circle of the price wheel, 1
through 24, as shown in Figure 5. Note that the numbers fall into exactly the same segments
as they do on the time wheel. In other words 1 is aligned with 1, 12 is aligned with 12, 24 in
the outer circle is in the same segment as 24 in the inner circle. The placement of the price
numbers is extremely important, they must correspond to the time numbers exactly. The price
numbers can continue on to infinity, or at least as high as where your favorite commodity is
trading. The DOW Jones Industrial Averages are now trading around 3500, if you were doing
a price wheel for the DOW you would need the numbers to go a little higher than 3500.
However, a wheel from 1 to 3500 is going to be pretty large, and cumbersome too. Therefore,
it is not necessary to insert every number on the wheel, in fact, only the numbers that cover

the most recent trading ranges are really needed for what we are working with in this chapter.
{if you want to do a longer term review of a particular commodity or stock you would then want
to have a larger range of numbers to cover the highs and lows of specific years. But that is

another chapter and another book.)
For the shorter term trading purposed discussed here, only the numbers that include the

recent months highs and lows are needed. First establish the recent trading range that your
favorite commodity or stock has traded in for the last 9 to 12 months. For example, if it has
traded between 375 and 480, those numbers and ail numbers in between are needed on the
wheel. Figure 6 shows how to insert these numbers onto the price wheel. Note that | have
started the outer wheel at 361, then continued out to 480. Why start at 361? There is a very
special reason for this, which is to emphasize that the outer price numbers must always follow

inthe correct order and be put in the correct place. It is easy for you to see that 361 follows
360 which is the last number on the time wheel. It is important that the price numbers
correspond to the time numbers. That is easy to see and do when the price numbers are
under 360, but since the time wheel numbers never exceed 360 and the price numbers do,
special attention must be paid to keeping the price numbers in the proper sequence.
Therefore, 361 can only be placed in the 1st segment of the outer wheel. 362 or 364 can
never be placed in that 1st segment. Other numbers that can fail in the 1st segment are 385,
409, 433, 457, 481 etc. These are all numbers that when placed consecutively on the whee!
would fall in that exact spot in segment number 1. The reason | stress this point, is that when
making your own wheels, if the numbers are incorrect then prices will also be incorrect. Price
and time can only come together when the correct number sequence is used.

Let's do an example on the November 1987 Soybeans Chart 1B from Chapter 1. Note,
the price range on this chart from April to August was 500 to 625. These are the numbers
needed on the outer wheel. We find that 481 is the closest number to 500. 481 will start the

Soybean price wheel in the correct number sequence as shown in Figure 7. To include 625,
the last number on this wheel has to be 648. This Soybeans wheel can now be used for
everything related to Chart 18, both time and price wise. For the rest of this chapter | will
concentrate totally on the price wheel, in order for you to become totally familiar with it before
moving on to incorporate the planets into the inner time wheel in Chapter 5.

The best way to utilize and mark on the wheel is with colored pens. You'll need a handful!
| color code everything, it makes it real easy for me to see the complete picture. Since | don't
have the luxury of using colors in this book, what I'm showing you will not be clear unless you
color it. Figure 7 is left unmarked for you to make copies for the exercise to follow in Figure 8,

and of course, for your own use at a later date.

SOYBEANS CUSTOMIZED TIME
& PRICE WHEEL FOR CHART 18

THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK™

by Jeanne Long

Chart 1B from Chapter 1, Soybeans 1987 will be used as our first example of putting price
onto the outer wheel of the Universal Clock. Let's take our old friends the predicted price
dates and find the price ranges for each of those dates. For simplicities sake | have rounded
out prices to even numbers.

Date 1 price range = 539 to 554

Date 2 price range = 544 to 549

Take a colored pen and circle 539 and 554 on the outer wheel of Figure 8. Now, in the
same color draw a line between them to connect them so that you can see the whole trading
range. Next, take another color of pen and circle 544 and 549, again connect them to each
other. Note, that they overlap on the wheel. The overlap is important. This overlap of price

could have easily been seen on Chart 1B without going through this exercise. So why is it
important? Chart 10A and Figure 9 will answer this question. Figure 8 and Chart 1B are just
used as an example for your future reference of what you will be looking for on the price
wheel. You are looking for an overlap of the two predicted dates price ranges. You will note
that on Chart 10A, the two predicted dates do not overlap as we expected they would. in
Chapter 1, | talked about how this occasionally would happen. It does not mean that the whole
geometric set up of the market has fallen apart. In fact quite the opposite is happening, the
price is still trading in a mathematically correct range as Figure 9 will demonstrate.
Take the trading ranges of both of the predicted dates.

Date 1 price range = 599 to 609
Date 2 price range = 557 to 565

With a colored pen circle 599 and 609 on Figure $, and connect them. With a different
color circle 557 and 565 and also connect them. Now you can see there is an overlap of price
range on the price wheel, even though prices are not in the same circles, they are in the same
segments of the wheel, therefore are considered overlapping price ranges. This means that
even though price on Date 2 has moved into new trading territory, it has done so in perfect
geometric order.

What this means for Soybeans is, when the price moves up or down in this manner there
will be 24¢, 48¢ or 72¢ difference in the price of Date 1 and the price of Date 2. Remember
units of 24, they are the mathematically correct numbers for Soybeans to move to new levels.
In other words price can only move up or down within a certain mathematical framework.
Therefore, if price is not overlapping in the same circle, it will be overlapping but from another
circle. What triggers this type of price move up or down. Planetary timers!

The true value of this information will become clear as you look at more charts. You will find
that not only do these two particular price ranges overlap, but that predicted date price ranges
over a several year period, all overlap in what | call ‘families of aspects.’ More on that later. You
can only look at several years of price ranges on the cash charts, the futures charts will not
work for this.

KEY NUMBERS FOR COMMODITIES AND STOCKS

We have already determined that the key number for Soybeans is 24. You'll find that 24 is
the most important number in all markets. Whenever any market has moved 24 points up or
down, price will usually congest or reverse.

However, divisions and multiples of 24 carry weight too. This is simply understood in
terms of all markets are not equal in price. For some, 24 points would be a large move, while
others it is only a small move. It becomes necessary, therefore, to put 24 into the proper
perspective for each individual market. The general rules are as follows. Markets that trade in
price ranges of 450 to 700 work well with 24 as their key numbers. Markets with price trading
250 to 450 do better with 12 (24+2) as their key number. Markets and stocks trading between
50 and 250 work well in units of 6 (24+4). When a market that generally moves in units of 6
has made four 6 point moves for a total of 24 points, it has then reached a strong area of
resistance or support.

The DOW Jones Industrial Averages is now trading in the 3500 area. Making the number
24 appear to be insignificant for the DOW. The key number therefore must be much higher.
You'tl find 240 (24X10) works extremely weil.

These are general guide tines, remember markets are living and breathing things,
constantly changing and moving. The numbers therefore need to be adjusted as new highs
or lows are reached. But, however you adjust the numbers, you will find that 24 and multiples
and divisions of it are always constant.

THE PRICE WHEEL AND THE S&P

On predicted priced dates the S&P will trade 12 points higher or lower, if this happens to
be one of the times it fails to trade in the expected or same range. On rare occasions the S&P
will trade 24 higher or lower than the previous range, or 36 higher or lower than the previous
range. A good example of this is shown on Chart 10B. The move from the predicted date
12/6 to the predicted date 1/5 was 36 points. This is easy to check (even without the wheel),
take the high of 12/6 = 388 + 36 = 424. Look at price on 1/5 and note the high was 424! (1/5
was a Sunday therefore, 1/6 is the date to use.)

Since the S&P works in units of 12, notice that whenever the predicted date prices are 12
points or 36 points from each other, they will fall opposite each other on the Universal Clock
price wheel. If they are 24 points apart they will overlap on the price wheel. See example on
Figure 10, circle high and low of 12/6, 381 and 388, connect them. Now circle low and high of
1/5, 422 and 425 and connect them. Note that they are opposite each other. The prices are
opposite each other just as they should be for perfect mathematical order in the S&P.

FAMILIES OF PLANETARY ASPECTS AS RELATED TO THE PRICE WHEEL

The Sun and Jupiter are the two planets used for the repetition of price dates/predicted
dates on the S&P. In the course of approximately one year, the Sun makes 12 contacts with
Jupiter, known as aspects. (If necessary, review Chapter 2.) Several years of Sun/Jupiter
trines can be isolated and reviewed as a group. For simplicities sake, | call a group of trines
aspects a family of trines.’ All square aspects are of the same family, and so on. in the past we
had just compared the prices of the last two predicted dates, we have not until now
differentiated between the types of aspects. Now we want to isolate one family of aspects and
compare prices on those dates only.

The fact that the family of trines created a move of 36 points twice is not a coincidence.
Just as the individual aspect date creates price repetition in pairs, families of aspects also work
in pairs. This is another clue that will enable you to hone in on the correct predicted price
‘range. In other words, when predicting a price for date 2, check the following things.

A. Take price range of date 1,to give the price range for date 2. A large percentage of

the time you will be correct.

B. Next, note the planetary aspect that will occur on date 2. (Is it a trine, for example.) Go

back to find the last 3 dates when that same family aspect occurred. Take the price ranges

of these dates and compare them to each other to determine if price is moving in a

specific amount from one date to the next (example: is price the same, or in increments of

12 points, 24 points or 36 points). If it is moving a specific amount, add this amount to the

price of the very last aspect of same family. Having done this, does the result equal the

same price as date 1 (A) is predicting? {f so, you have a double confirmation of the long
and the short term geometry coming together.

| realize that this process is now becoming quite complex, and it gets more so as we
continue on. With the information given so far you can do a pretty good job of predicting date
2's price range with approximately 70% accuracy. To do better, you have to be willing to take
the time to untangle the many wheels within wheels that are operating within the Universal
Clock. If you invest the time you will be richly rewarded.

THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGES AND THE PRICE WHEEL

The price wheel for the DOW Jones Industrial Averages has to incorporate the latest
trading ranges of the DJIA, which as of May 1993 is approximately 3500. The key number for
the DJIA is 240 (24X10).

Figure 13 illustrates the DJIA price wheel. Note that the inner wheet is still 1 to 360.
While the price wheel is 1930 to 3600. Each segment of the price wheel increases by 10
points. This wheel will handle all the price ranges on the DJIA from 1988 to 1993. Figure 13
can be used for copies for all your DJIA work.
Chart 10E will demonstrate how to transfer the data from the graph to the price wheel,
Figure 14. The Sun/Jupiter dates are used forthe DJIA.

Take the two dates from Chart 10E, where price had a big move up. Date 1 = 12/6. Date 2
= 1/5 (1/5 was a Sunday), so 1/6 is the date used for price.

Date! = 12/6 price range 2860 to 2925
Date2 = 1/6 price range 3165 to 3230

With a colored pen circle 2860 and 2925 on Figure 14, then connect to each other. Next,
circle 3165 and 3230 and also connect. Note, that the high of 12/6 touched the low of 1/6.

Meaning that the DOW moved up the correct amount of 240. If you add 240 to the trading
range of 12/6:

2860 2925
249 240
3100 to 3165 = same as low on 1/6

Remember that this planetary alignment occurred over the weekend. We noted in a
previous chapter, how often the Friday and Monday ranges, under these circumstances, are
both in the expected range. Friday's (1/3) trading range was 3155 to 3220. The important
point to note here is how price got up to 240 higher just as the Sun/Jupiter aspect was due!

All of the other Sun/Jupiter dates on Chart 10E were the regular types of price overlap.

FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS ON THE DOW PRICE WHEEL

The following is an example of the ‘trine family’ only. Since 12/12/87 to 2/3/93 there
<were 11 trine aspects formed between the Sun and Jupiter. Therefore, price on 11 dates are
now to be compared.

if prices were chosen at random from 11 dates in a period of 5 1/2 years, you would not
expect a correlation or any relationship to occur between those prices. However, the 11 trine
dates form a very important relationship. The fact that there is a relationship between these
dates, clearly confirms the truth of long-term market geometry at work.

The 11 Sun/Jupiter trine dates are listed below, along with the high and low of the DJIA
on those dates. The prices were taken off the DJIA charts and therefore in some cases they
may be one point in error. However, for the exercises on Figure 15, notice the DOW price
wheel numbers increase at 10 points per segment, so 1 point will not make a difference.

1. 8/23/87 12678 H2730
2. 12/12/87 L1838 H1889
3. 9/28/88 L2070 H2096
4. 1/16/89 12215 H2236

10. 4/24/92 L3305 H3381
11, 2/3/93 _L3325 H3400

On Figure 15, take a colored pen and circle all of the low prices on the dates. For example,
#1 on 8/23/87 the low is 2678, the closest number on the price wheel is 2680. Circle this
number. Where the DJIA price ends in 5, | have always gone to the lower number. See #4,
Low of 2215, the closest number is 2210.

You will note immediately that the lows fall in clusters of 3 to a cluster. (Three is interesting
in that the trine is 1/3 of 360!) How can random prices fall into these patterns unless there is a
specific geometrical framework to prices? If you take the midpoint of each high and low and
insert these numbers on the wheel, you will see that they form pretty much the same pattern
as the lows form. If you add in the highs and color each high/low pair in a different color you will
notice an even larger pattern setting up of cycles working within cycles.

The point being made here is that in the short term, intermediate or long term there is a
mathematical sequence within in which market prices operate. The knowledge and
awareness of this can help you make better price predictions on the repetition dates and
becomes even more valuable when you combine all of the tools presented in this book.

This Chapter has covered overlaps of prices when placed on the outer wheel. It is
necessary to be familiar with how the price wheel works before introduction to the planetary
wheel can begin. This information will be combined with the inner wheel in the next chapter.

PLANETS IN ACTION

The mingled influence of the stars can be understood by no one who has not previously
acquired knowledge of the combinations and varieties in nature. Ptolemy

This chapter will explain the time wheel and how to use it. | will also introduce the planets
into the inner wheel of the Universal Clock. One of the easiest ways to work with time (planets}
and price is to start by illustrating how the planets correspond to price in the form of channel
lines on the regular bar charts.

The first step is to insert the planets into the inner wheel. To do this, take the position of
Saturn for January 1, 1992, see Figure 16 below. You will notice the symbol for Saturn is
circled. The date is also circled along with Saturn's position on the 1st. The listings in the
ephemeris are always shown in symbols. Unfortunately for those of you who are not familiar
with the symbols, you now have to learn 12 new ones. The backdrops of the solar system is
divided up into 12 equal segments of 30° each (30 X 12 = 360 the full circle of the solar
system). It is divided up in this manner for easy identification of a planet position on any given
date.

The 12 segments are called the ‘signs of the zodiac.’ They are listed below in their
natural order along with the symbols assigned to each one.

Aries ve 0° to 30°
Taurus Q 30° to 60°
Gemini itt 60° to 90°
Cancer BS 90° to 120°
Leo ft 120° to 150°
Virgo me 150° to 180°
Libra past 180° to 210°
Scorpio M, 210° to 240°
Sagittarius £ 240° to 270°
Capricorn V3 270° to 300°
Aquarius baal 300° to 330°
Pisces x 330° to 360°

In the ephemeris, the planets will always be residing in any one of the 12 signs. On
January 1, 1992, for example, Saturn is listed as being in 5° 51’ (5 degrees and 51 minutes} of
Aquarius (3%). The question now is, how do we take Saturn's position from the circle of the
heavens and place it into the wheel of the Universal Clock? If the Universal Clock was a flat
circle of 360° just like the circle of the heavens, then placing Saturn into the clock would be
easy. Since the Universal Clock is not a flat circle, it becomes necessary to do one more
calculation. This calculation is to convert 5° <= 51’, which is a division of 360°, into its whole
number on the 360° circle. This is easily done by looking at Aquarius on the list above and
Noting its position on the 360° circle is 300° to 330°. Therefore 300° is the start of Aquarius,
Saturn is at 5° 51’ = 300 + 5 = 305° 51’. Perfect! There is only one small step left and that is to
round out the minutes (51') to the nearest degree. There are 60’ to 1°, therefore 51’ is closer
to being one full degree, this 1° is then added to 305° = 306°. (In the following examples, if
the minutes are Jess than 30' the number will be rounded down. If the minutes are more than
30' they are rounded up to the next whole number.)

You can also use the Conversion Table for this same process, Figure 17. The top line of

the table lists all of the signs. Look across this line and find Aquarius { =), circle it. Next look
« atthe first column on the lett, it is numbered 0 to 29, find the number 5 and circle it. Next, look

across on line 5 until you reach the column under Aquarius (=), take that number = 305!
(+51° = 306).

Finally, Saturn at 306° is ready to be placed into the time wheel of the Universal Clock!

Actually this whole process doesn't take more than a couple of seconds once you are familiar

with it.

Use Figure 18, the Universal Clock for the DOW Jones Industrial Averages. On the inner
wheel circle the number 306. To find the price that correlates with 306, look outwards to the
price wheel in the same segment as 306. There you will find 7 DOW prices listed. Reading
from the center out, there are 2100, 2340, 2580, 2820, 3060, 3300 and 3540. These are the
DJIA prices that correlate to Saturn at 306.

So, how do we know which number to use? Simple. Look at Chart 11A of the DJIA
January 1992 to August 1992. Make a note of where the price is trading in January 1992.
Approximately 3025 to 3300. Now take the two numbers off the price wheel that are the
closest to the trading range in January. These two numbers are 3060 and 3300. Therefore
they are the numbers we will use. On Chart 11A, mark a small dot on January 1 at 3060 and
another small dot at 3300. So far all your work doesn't tell you much of anything, because now

it is necessary to complete this exercise by finding the Saturn numbers for February through
August and place them all on Chart 114.

On Figure 19 you will find the ephemeris with positions of Saturn on the first day of every
month through to August.
1. Take the position on the first of each month.
2. Convert it to a whole number on the 360° circle. (Use the conversion table Figure 17.)
3. Place the resulting number into the time wheel.

4. Look out to the price wheel and find the two price numbers that are the closest to the
trading range in that month.

5. Place these two prices in the form of a dot on to Chart 11A.

For your convenience | have listed Saturn's position on the 1st of each month, along with
the conversion number. However, going through the whole procedure yourself will not only
familiarize you with the process, but at the same time it will give you the idea of how Satum
moves, This is important for later.

Place these numbers Place these numbers on
on the inner wheel, Chart 11A in the form of a dot.

When all the dots are placed on Chart 11A, connect them to form a channel. Chart 11B,
has the completed channel lines. WOW! How about that, price was contained by the
channels for the whole time period! That looks pretty impressive to me. It is easy to see that
price is contained by the Saturn boundaries. What caused breakouts from one channel to the
next? Planetary aspects of course, see Chapter 7. Notice how price works its way from one
side of the channel to the other and then back again. When price is on the actual channel line
this means that price and time have come together. This is very important, because when time
and price come together, price will either reverse or move to new levels. It is time for a change
to take place. The Saturn channels can also be projected out to the future enabling you to
know future resistance and support areas in advance.

Chart 11C illustrates the Saturn channels on the DJIA through to November 1992. Notice
how Saturn caught the low in April, the high in June and the high again in August and
September. Finally, Saturn snagged the low in October! And the beautiful part about Saturn
channels is the fact that you can project them out into the future, as shown by projection to
December on Chart 11C. This is such a great way to monitor the DJIA.

Chart 11D brings the prices up to June 1993. Lo and behold, Saturn is still right there
holding the highs! Again, the Saturn channets are projected out into July 1993. | usually
project my Saturn lines out a full year. This gives me a good understanding of where the
market can go in the coming year.

For your convenience, | have listed Saturn's position along with ail of the price equivalents
used for Charts 11C.and 11D. Do the work for yourself to become familiar with it.

Note, as of the July listing, Saturn was moving backwards in Retrograde motion.

The Saturn channels can easily be used for monitoring the market. They combine
beautifully with technical tools, especially when price reaches the Saturn line, look to your
technical tools to givé you a signal to buy or sell. Watch how price closes around the channel
line. If the market is about to reverse and move quickly away from the Saturn line, generally it
will not close through it. A good example is shown on Chart 11C in April, June, August and
October. Price never closed through the channel line! At other times, price congests on the
Saturn line, again watch the closes. If price should close through the line, it is generally never
more than 30 points over the line, if congestion is to set up. The rule of thumb is as follows: if
the high of the bar of the first close above the Saturn line is taken out (by price trading above
it), expect the market to go higher. Look at Chart 11D, end of May, note the close above the
ling by about 15 points. [f this bar's high is now taken out, expect the market to go much
higher. If during a congestion at the Saturn channel line, one bar forms an isolated high (or
low} during a period of several trading days, then look to use the isolated high bar to give the
signal for the market to move higher, if price takes out the isolated high.

The same principal holds true for prices reversing after touching the channel. Example as
on Chart 11C, April, June, August and October. When prices close past the bar or bar that
touches the channel line the market will be reversed.

When a Saturn line is broken and price moves through this is generally shown by a close
of more than 30 points past the line. Once price is on the other side of the line, if for instance
the price went up through the Saturn Jine, watch for the line to now become support.

These are general rules, to give you ideas of how to use the channels on your own charts
or incorporate them into your own trading plans. | am reticent to give firm rules or trading plans
when what we are talking about here is only one part of the puzzle. The astro-tools all work
together and it is necessary to have them all and study them ail before an astro-trading plan
can be formulated. However, | realize that many of the readers will not want to get into an —.
indepth study of the planetary information. Therefore, | always suggest using the astro-tools
with a competent technical system. Under these terms you will find them to be an excellent
addition to your trading tool box.

CHANNEL LINE WITH OTHER COMMODITIES

The Saturn channel lines offer support and resistance on other commodities too. Chart
12A (March 1992 Contract) shows the British £. In July and August 1991 the price of the
British £ touched the Saturn line. Notice in August how price suddenly fell to be caught by
Saturn on August 19. On that day time and price were reached! Price immediately shot back

up.

To place the Satur lines on the £ chart, it is necessary to determine the position of Saturn
in July and August. The ephemeris in Figure 20 shows Saturn on July 15 to be at 4° 3s 23' =
304. Look to Figure 21, the Universal Clock for the currencies, circle 304 and note the prices
that are the closest to the trading range in July, see Chart 124. The chart shows the prices
would be 160 and 184. Make a dot at 160 on Chart 12A.

. To find where the Saturn channel is by August 19, again take the position of the planet
from the ephemeris, Figure 20, = 1°23=52' = 302. On the time wheel 302 equals a price of 158
or 182. Bingo! 158 was exactly the low of price on August 19. This means time and price
came together and price shot up. Where will price go? Once it has started to move away from
one channel line, it then tries to go to the channel line above. The channel line on the top
side as we have already determined is at 182 in August 1991.

Chart 12B illustrates price reaching the upper channel line in December 1991.
Once price traded at the 184 area on the Saturn line, it then fell very quickly back down to the

172 area by January 15! .
The halfway point between the Saturn channels is another important stopping point for

price. Note how price fell to the halfway paint {shown by a dotted fine on Chart 12B) and this
line held as this support to price in January. In February and March price tested it again and
once through the dotted line, went on to where? You guessed it, the lower Saturn channel ~
ine!
* chart 12C is another example of price falling to a Saturn line, which held as support for
approximately one month before other planetary energies propelied price through the Saturn
line to make new jows.

lt Saturn creates channel lines, wnat about the other planets, do they create channels
too? The answer is yes!

The planets move around the Universa! Clock just like the hands move around the regular
clock. The everyday clock has 3 hands, for hours, minutes and seconds. The Universal Clock

others slowly. The faster planets create short term cycles and short term channels. The
slower planets form long term cycles and channels.

The Sun, Mercury and Venus have short term cycles. Mars and Jupiter have intermediate
cycles, and Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are fong term indicators. The Moon is an
extremely short term planet and well suited for intraday trading among other things. The Moon

« will not be covered in this book. There is too much data for one chapter. Several chapters may
do or even a whole book.

Chart 13A shows the Deutsche Mark in October of 1992 as price reached a Neptune
channel. Neptune was at 16° V$ 12' on October 5, 1992 = 286°. On the currencies wheel,
Figure 21, note that 286 placed on the time wheel correlates to 70 on the price wheel! Note
how quickly price fell down after touching the Neptune channel. Chart 13B, December 1992
Silver, illustrates how Saturn, Neptune and Uranus congregated around the same point on the
time wheel between March and July 1992. See Figure 22. This also means that the channel
lines are grouped together on the chart. This created a strong resistance area. Note that the

Look how well Saturn and Neptune work together on the DJIA. Usually if price is
overshooting Saturn it is because it is reaching out to Neptune. Another example of Saturn

« and Neptune working together is shown in Chart 13D. This chart illustrates Neptune at the
high of the DJIA, while Saturn held the low. However, price sliced through three Saturn lines

before coming to rest on the 4th one. The energy behind the market moving in this manner
will be covered in Chapter 7.

Chart 14A shows Saturn and Jupiter working together on Oil. Firstly notice how price
traveled up the Saturn channe! from February 17 to March 30. By April, Saturn had carried
price up near the Jupiter channel line. The Jupiter line picked up the price and carried it
through April, then Jupiter boosted price up to the Saturn channel at the top. This is rather
like a relay race. Price is handed over from one planet to the next. Price now traded at the
Saturn line for about a month before dropping down to touch the rising Jupiter line bouncing
quickly off it to retreat to the upper Saturn line. This again is an excellent example of price
trading from one planetary line to the next.

Charts 14B and C illustrate Sugar trading with the Pluto lines. Sugar likes to trade around
the Pluto lines, just moving back and forth over the line. If price gets too far away from one
Pluto fine, it then moves up or down to attach itself to the next one. Chart B shows the weekly
long term Sugar chart with a series of the Pluto channel lines. Look how long price traded
between the two lower channel lines, from late 1990 to 1993!! Pluto certainly defines the
long term cycles for Sugar.

Finally, Chart 15A. The British £ illustrates a combination of planetary lines. Saturn,
Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Mars lines are all placed on this chart. Price came down from
higher levels to support on the rising Saturn line trom December 28 to January 27. At which
time Mars came into the price range and carried price down with it to the next level of planetary
lines on a lower level. Get the picture of price playing tag with the planetary lines? Price traded
under these lines and they became resistance, until price broke through the Jupiter line took
off up chasing the Mars fine. Two important things happened on February 15, 1993. Firstly,
Mars has been retrograde, as can be seen by the falling Mars line. Whenever a channel line is
moving down it means that the planet involved is in Retrograde motion, when the line is
moving up the ptanet is in Direct motion. On the 15th Mars started moving forward again. That
in itself signaled a reversal of price. However, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune all came into
the same segment otf the time wheel on that day. See figure 23. Mars was almost at a
standstill because of reversing direction and the other planets are slow moving so they stayed
in this connection from February 14 through February 23. On the futures Chart 15A you can't
appreciate what this gathering of planets really did. But if you refer to Chart 158, the cash chart
for the British £, you will see that as soon as Mars changed direction on February 15, price
immediately came up to trade in the 1.46 area. 1.46 is of course, the price equivalent of all of
the planets. See Figure 23 . In other words, price and time came together again at a very
important turning point, shown by four hands of the Universal Clock coming together at the
same time. The cash charts always adhere to the price and time numbers more accurately than
the futures charts do. But you will generatly know when the futures chart price comes close to
the time and price number, then the cash chart is probably right on it.

Whenever two or more planets come together in the same segment of the time wheel,
look for market reversals. More about this in Chapter 7.

Some study of the planetary lines on your favorite commodity should enable you to see

the importance and usefuiness of these lines for monitoring the trend, as well as determining
the end of a trend.

Once you understand the procedure of putting the planets onto the graph, it becomes
really quick and easy to do. But for those who don’t want to go through the learning curve, |
will have a computer program finished by the end of 1993, it wilt puae all the planetary lines on
the charts for you.
CHAPTER 6

THE DIVISIONS OF THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK

My calculations are based on the cycle theory and mathematical sequences. History
repeats itself. That is what I have always contended - that in order to know and predict
the future of anything you only have to look up what has happened in the past and get a
correct base or starting point. W.D. Gann

The Universal Ciock has other useful applications. The actual ctock itseif has areas of
extreme sensitivity to price and time (planets}. On Figure 24 (1) note the heavy lines dividing
the clock into four equal quadrants marked A, B, C and D. These division lines are highly
sensitive to price traveling over them. When price reaches the divisions, it generally reverses
or congests. B

A = 24-LINE THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK™

by Jeanne Long

Of the four division lines, the most important one is the line marked A, called the ‘24-line.’
Price and time on the Universal Clock start and end at this line. It is the beginning and end for
all circles of 24, and it is also the start and finish of the 1° to 360° circle. Therefore, whenever
price reaches the 24-line, an important price cycle can be starting or finishing.

To place the 24-line on your graph see Chart 16A. First, determine the whole range
where price has traded on this chart = 1.58 to 1.72. Now look on Figure 25, with a colored pen
circle 1.58 and 1.72, draw a line to connect them. You will immediately see that the price
traded over the 24-line at A. In fact, when price was at 1.68 and 1.69 it was exactly at the line,
since these two numbers straddle the line. 1.68 - 1.69 are called ‘key price numbers’ for the
British £. Be aware that in the future, whenever price reaches the 1.68 to 1.69 area it will
experience some difficulty in getting through it. Price will congest or reverse there. The other
‘key price areas’ to be watched tor the British £ are 1.44 to 1.45 and 1.92 to 1.93. Notice
these numbers also straddle the 24-line at A, on Figure 25.

HOW TO PLACE THE 24-LINES ON THE CHART

Chart 16B shows how to place the key numbers 1.68 - 1.69 on the graph. They are
simply drawn in as two straight lines. Once placed on the chart, the 24-lines are constant, they
are always there, they never change. 1.68 - 1.69 will always be an area of support or
resistance on the British £ graphs. On chart 16B, note how price traded up to the 24-line and
then traded around it for a full two months. So how can we use this information for trading?
We can't until we complete the chart. Look at Chart 16C, | have now added another set of
lines. These are taken directly from the intermediate division of the Universal Clock at D, see
Figure 25. 1.62 - 1.63 straddle the intermediate line in the lower quadrant of the clock. This
line, when placed on chart 16C gave support to price from late July to September. A
congestion formed at the intermediate line area. The market took a breather there.

Chart 16D shows even further divisions. | have drawn a dotted line halfway between the
24-line and the intermediate line. The dotted line illustrates just how far through the major
lines price generally trades, without moving on to higher or lower levels. | have also shaded
Certain areas of the graph to show how the majority of the price bars on Chart 16D were in the
areas between the major lines and the half way fines! In fact, there was very little trading out of
these areas.

On the British £, when price comes to the 24-line or an intermediate line, watch it congest
and hold within the 3¢ area of the line.

Chart 16E is a continuation of the previous chart. Notice how price, once it was ready to
leave the 24-line area, moved up very sharply as of November 4. Price moved into the higher
trading area between the next intermediate line up and the dotted line, where it traded for
over a month. Look back to Chart 16D and see exactly the same price action on September 5.

The intermediate lines on Chart 16E are taken directly off Figure 25 at the B and C
divisions. Again the dotted lines were placed halfway between the intermediate lines to give
you a reference or just how far price trades on either side of the major divisions.

The 24-line and the intermediate jines can be incorporated in a very simple way with your
own personal technical tool box. For example, on Chart 16E, take any sell signal from your
technical tools as price comes back below the intermediate fine into the 1.80 area in January.
My son, Danton S. Long, has written a book in which he illustrates technical methods for
entry/exits and stops at these major lines. He shows how to set up a trading system using
these lines alone. If you want to get in touch with him you will find his name and address at the
back of the book.

The ‘second test’ of the 24-line or intermediate lines is always a useful signal, indicating
the market can now make a push to another Jevel. See Chart 16& at areas marked 1 and 2.
Example 1 was a ‘second test.’ November 18-25 was the first test of the intermediate line,
price fell from there down to the dotted line by November 26-29. The dotted line held, price
bounced up again to the intermediate line for the ‘second test’ of that line on December 5.
Price did not linger on the intermediate line this time, instead on December 6 price gapped
over to the other side of the line. The direction of this gap gives a clear signal for the direction
of price on the coming move. Watch this pattern, it forms with regularity on the British £.
Example 2 on Chart 16E is also a ‘second test’ of the intermediate line. The first test was the
congestion in December and January at the 1.80 to 1.82 line. Price then fell to lower levels,
but came back up to make this second test on February 7th. On February 10 price moved
away from the intermediate line to the down side, February 11 price gapped down. The gap
was a clear signal that price was heading lower. A trade can be initiated on the open of these
second test gaps. The risk is small, because if the gap is closed, what you were expecting to
happen is not happening. Look to combine the second test and gaps with your own personal
technical tools.

How do you know if an intermediate line or a 24-line is going to create congestion, reverse
or kick price through? The following general rules may help.
1. Price is drawn to the intermediate and 24-lines. If price is not going to reverse right away it
generally stays within the confines of the lines and the dotted line area on either side. Once it
breaks the dotted line it will then try to go on to the next level.
2. Price is in congestion when it is trading at major lines and inside the dotted lines. The first
signal that price is breaking out of congestion is the closing over the dotted line or gapping
over the dotted line. Look for the high of the bar with the first close over the dotted line to be
taken out by several ticks. This then gives a good entry signal for a move to a higher level.
Illustrated below are some examples of the price breaking out from the dotted line. Obviously
there will be some patterns that do not fit the examples, but the majority will.

$08 Chart 16E al H seo Chast 16F

3. When price sails straight through an intermediate or 24-line, you know the market is
extremely strong and it’s heading on to the next level.

4, The second test, example on Chart 16E, shows how the 24-line or intermediate lines
create reversals.

see Chart 16D Sept 30-Oct 7

Chart 16F illustrates price gapping over the dotted line. This happens with regularity on
the British £. Note these gaps are marked 1, 2 and 3. Under these circumstances a trade
could be taken on tne open of the gap day. Look to combine this with your own technical
tools. Generally with this type of gap, if you wait, it’s too late. On Chart 16E, at example
number 2 of the ‘second test,’ this was also the gap over the dotted line, giving a double sell
signal. Chart 16G also illustrates more gaps over the dotted line. The first gap over the dotted
line at | gave a nice profit, whereas, at J the gap over the dotted line proved to be a failure.
However the failures are few and far between. Without other tools to assist you with exits and
stops, a conservative standard order for 4¢ profit could be taken on each of these trades.
Also see Chart 16H at K and for more gaps over dotted line.

The other currencies function in a similar manner to the British £, although on each
commodity the parameters differ slightly.

Oil, Silver and DJIA also set their own boundaries, but as can be clearly seen by ail of the
example charts, the intermediate lines and the 24-line are powerful trading tools. The major
lines enable you to monitor price in an efficient way. By keeping the key numbers marked on
your chart enables you to know where price is heading over the longer term.

The key numbers for the DJIA are naturally 240 points apart. The price wheel of the DJIA
clock increase in units of 240 with each circle, see Figure 254. The DJIA key numbers are
1680/1690, 1920/1930, 2160/2170, 2400/2410, 2880/2890, 3120/3130 3360/3370,
3600/3610, etc.

Chart 20A illustrates the 24-lines on the 1987 DJIA chart. This chan shows support and
resistance to price, When price sliced down through the 24-lines, note how on October 19, it
traded exactly between the two lines at 1680 and 2160. It was really bad news when on
October 19 price gapped open below the 2160 line. When price starts gapping over the 24-
lines, watch out. In general, price gaps over the intermediate lines. Remember | talked about
those gaps as being good trades. But if you look at past charts of the DJIA, you will see it
seldom gaps over the 24-lines unless it is a serious move. This chart has no intermediate lines
placed on it, only 24-lines. Chart 20B DJIA 1991, shows a calmer market where price is trading
between the same 24-lines ail year. B

Chart 20C 1992 DJIA demonstrates price trading on the intermediate lines. There are
three intermediate lines at B, C and D on the DJIA wheel, Figure 25A. Intermediate line C is
opposite the 24-line and therefore when placed on the graph is half way between one 24-line
and the next. This intermediate line is important, because once price starts trading past it,
more often than not price will go on to the next 24-line. The intermediate lines at B and C
show how far past the 24-lines price usually trades without going to new ground. These
intermediate lines hold price to the 24-lines.

Chart 20D, DJIA 1993 shows how prices get past 24-lines. Notice, price began to move
over the 24-line at 3360/3370 in February 1993. | have also placed the Saturn line from a
previous chapter on chart 20D. This is to help you begin to put all the tools together. Look
how Saturn took price by the hand and led it up over the 24-line! As Saturn moved up price
followed! Saturn and this same 24-line held price throughout 1992. In 1993 Saturn was
moving forward and up and price went with it. Price swiftly went to the halfway intermediate
line and traded on that line through March, Aprit and May 1993. This is a signal price wanted to
go higher. We already knew that Saturn was moving higher. Saturn can be plotted on the
chart for the whole year in advance. By June price had followed Saturn up to near the 3600
line. When price reached this point we now knew that it had to go to 3600. Why? Because it
is trading over the intermediate line of 3540/3550 (at D on Figure 25A). This is the line that
would hold price to the 3600 line.

Saturn levels off at the 3550 area through October 1993, before starting to move up
again. This makes 3500 to 3600 a strong area for support/resistance for price all during this
time.

Chapter 7 goes into more details on the 24-lines. This chapter has covered price at the
24-lines and intermediate lines. Chapter 7 will explain planets on the 24-lines, an important
part of how to predict where future price will go.
CHAPTER 7

WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS

In every law of nature there is a major and a minor; a positive, a negative and a
neutral. Therefore, in cycles there must be a lessor, or greater and intermediate cycle, or
cycles within cycles. Like Ezekiel says: Wheel within a wheel. W.D. Gann

The time whee! is made up of wheels within wheels, in fact, 15 wheels in all. The planetary
movements within the time wheel create cycles within cycles as each planet travels around the
15 circles, moving at its own speed. The nine hands (planets) traveling the face of the
Universal Clock gives multiple ways of reading the market information revealed by the planets
via the time and price wheels. Tne previous chapters discussed some of the ways to derive
market information from the Universal Clock, however, only the tip of the iceberg has been
uncovered. This chapter will demonstrate several more ways to extract market information
from the Universal Clock.

The first example is simple and easy to do, since it follows the principle of using the
sensitivity of the 24-line. In this example we will monitor the planets passage over the 24-line
and read the resulting market information. The Sun will be covered first. It moves at
approximately 1° per day and travels the whole 360° in one year. (Remember, it is the Earth
that is actually moving not the Sun, but when looking at the Sun from Earth, the Sun appears
to be moving while Earth appears to be standing still.)

The approximate movement of the Sun is 1° per day, meaning that it crosses the 24-line

* once every 24 days. This creates a 24 day cycle, in market terms it is a 15 to 18 market days
cycle. The Sun crosses the 24-line when it is placed in the the following degrees. 0° to 1°,
24° to 25°, 48° to 49°, 72° to 73°, 96° to 97°, 120° to 121°, 144° to 145°, 168° to 169°, 192° to
193°, 216° to 217°, 240° to 241°, 264° to 265°, 288° to 289°, 312° to 313°, 336° to 337° and
360° to 0°. See Figure 26. On August 17/18, 1991, the ephemeris shows the Sun to be at
24° to 25° of Leo = 144° to 145°. (See Conversion Chart.) (For those Gann students out
there, you know that 144 was one of his very important numbers.) If you look on the wheel
you will see that 144° to 145° straddles the 24-line. Turn to Chart 21A, the British £, we will

on Saturday and Sunday, therefore we mark the next date which is Monday the 19th. Monday
marked the bottom of a trend down. Of course, we know from a previous chapter that price hit
the Saturn line on that day too. This created a double signal of a bottom forming on this date.
Notice the other dates marked with a dot. You will see they were at trend reversal points or
termination of energy areas. Scan through Charts 21A, 8, C, D, E and F. Note the Sun dates
correlated with price reversals with amazing regularity. Since the Sun has a 24 day cycle,
obviously it cannot create a major reversal every 24 days therefore, the Sun dates are
generally a minor reversal signal. When other planets are at the 24-line at the same time as the
Sun, major price reversals can occur depending on the planets involved.

Charts 224 and B Swiss Franc illustrates the Sun dates along with Mars dates. The dates
for Mars were found in exactly the same way as the dates for the Sun were found. Mars
crosses the 24-line approximately every 5 to 6 weeks except during its Retrograde periods.

Mars on average moves less than 1° per day, therefore it can take 2 to 3 days to pass over
the 24-line. A change of market direction can occur on any one of the the three days. Again,
this may bring a reversal of price or just a breather in a trend run.

Charts 23A and B Deutsche Mark finds both Sun and Mars dates working in exactly the
same way as they did on the British £ and Swiss Franc. | have now added two more planetary
dates to the Deutsche Mark charts. The two planets are the swiftly moving Mercury and
Venus. When they cross the 24-line, they inject price with a sudden short burst of energy,
offering a quick sharp move in price. Sometimes, of course, the moves turn into longer term
trend reversals, simply because other planetary qualifications have also been met. You can
easily incorporate the Mercury and Venus dates into your own technical trading system for
successful short term trades. The Mercury and Venus dates work just as well on the British £
and Swiss Franc.

Charts 23C, D, E and F illustrate the Silver prices responding to the same planetary
grouping and dates.

Charts 24A, B, C, D and E show the DOW Jones Industrial Averages with several new
additions along with the Mercury, Venus, Sun and Mars dates.

The first addition is the planet Uranus which was at the 24-line in 1987. Uranus at 24/25
Sagittarius (= 240-241) straddled the line from January 1987 to December 1987. You can
immediately see that Uranus moves slowly. The last time Uranus crossed the 24-line was in
1976. In 1987 was Uranus lying in wait all year ready to be triggered by the other planets.
Sometimes a slow moving planet will sit on the 24-line for several months, but none of the
other major factors fall into place while it is there. In other words, if ail the hands of the clock do
not come together there is no signal for a swift reversal.

When a slow moving planet sits on the 24-line for a long period of time a long term move in
the market can come to an end, but it will be a slow rounded turn. Unless one or more of the
energy planets come along to force a sudden shift, as in Chart 24A. In 1987 the energy
planets clicked in a big way. For example, Jupiter was also crossed the 24-line that year too.
Jupiter contacts the line approximately once in the year, unless it Retrogrades at the line, in
that case, there will be three passes over the line. This is exactly what happened in 1987,
Jupiter and Uranus came together on the line twice during the year. (On Jupiter's 3rd pass
Uranus had already moved away from the line.) These contacts offered two opportunities for
the market to make a move. The first Jupiter/Uranus contact was in June 1987 and the
second in October 1987. When Jupiter is acting alone it generally stays at the 24-line for 1-3

weeks, during which time the market makes a good move (see other examples of this on
Charts 24B, C, D and E). However, in October 1987 Jupiter was not acting alone. What else
was happening? We know Venus helps make sharp moves. A check of Venus’ position
shows it came to the 24-line on October 16. But, Venus also lined up with Uranus and Jupiter
on the 24-line on June 21, 1987. Another thing both dates had in common was Mercury
going retrograde on June 21 and again on October 16. So what was the difference between
the two dates? Well, first of all, before getting to October, let me say that all this strong energy
in June was not lost - it helped fuel the market move up. The one very important factor
present only in the October grouping was that Mars and Saturn came together on the wheel.
See Figure 27. Every time Mars and Saturn come together on the wheel, they add a spurt of
energy to the markets. (To get a feel for the normal action of Mars and Saturn when operating
alone, see Charts 24B, C, D and E.) So, how did the events of October of 1987 unfold?
1. October 4, Mercury hit the 24-line with the Sun close behind on October 5, this in
general would be a minor change of trend. In fact, for a while the first few days of the
reversal looked like a minor change in trend!

2. Jupiter came onto the 24-line October 9th until October 23. This indicated a good move
during that time.

3. Uranus was on the 24-line along with Jupiter when Venus joined them on October 15.
Venus by itself indicated a sharp move so combined with the other two planets added
energy and momentum.

4. On October 16, Mars moved up to Saturn on the wheel giving the additional energy to
speed the market on its way.

THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK™

by Jeanne Long
On this rare occasion in October 1987 the four triggers of sudden market movement were
alt in effect.

The triggers of sudden market moves are:
1. Uranus

2. Jupiter

3. Venus

4. Mars/Saturn

Mars and Saturn do not have to be on the 24-line when they come together in the wheel.
They can be anywhere on the wheel.

One other point of interest, look at Figure 27, read out from the Mars/Saturn segment to
see what prices correlate with the planets. These prices are as follows: 2570, 2330, 2090,
1850 and 1610. (The last two numbers are calculated by subtracting 240 from 2090 = 1850 -
240 = 1610.) Now look at Chart 24A, you will see price traded through all these numbers and
stopped on the Mars/Satum number at 1610!

| have included the Saturn lines on Charts 24A, B, C, D and E because they are such
important monitors of market action and movement.

Chart 24E pulls in tools from previous chapters to illustrate that everything works together.
The 24-lines have been placed on this chart along with the Neptune lines, Uranus lines,
Saturn lines and Jupiter lines. The planetary lines crossing the 24-lines can be clearly seen in
this chart. Planetary lines crossing the 24-lines are a visual display of the planets at the 24th
division of the wheel. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were back and forth over the 24-line
correlating with price at 3360 all of 1992. The Saturn line broke away from the 24-line in late
1992 and took off up and naturally took price with it. While Saturn had been straddling the
price-line at 3360 it was resistance to price. When Saturn pulled price up with it over the 3360
line, it then became support. Now price is moving up with Saturn to the next higher level at
3600. As of early July 1993 Saturn is over half way to the 3600 line therefore, it has to go to it.

The Neptune and Uranus lines are still straddling the 24-price line at either 3600 or 3360
and they will be straddling this area until December 1993.

In order to project price out into the future follow these guidelines:

1. Place all 24-price lines on your charts along with the intermediate lines, if you are trading
short term, otherwise just use 24-lines.

2. Place major planetary lines on the chart and project them out into the future. Major
planetary lines are Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. | also place Jupiter lines onto the
graph,plus for short term trading | add the Mars lines.

3. When the planetary tines cross the 24-price lines then you know this planet is on the 24-
line of the time wheel. When planets are on the 24-lines watch closely for other planets to
then come into play, especially the ones that trigger sharp moves.

4. Make a list of the dates the planets are on the 24-lines, plus when Mars and Saturn are
together. You can make the list by way of a table as in the following example. This table

gives you a full month of planetary data at a glance. You can easily see all the dates when
major and minor reversals may occur.

PLANETS TAKE PRICE BY THE HAND

Happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that geteth understanding.
Proverbs

The next step is rather complex. | have wracked (maybe wrecked} my brain in trying to
figure out a simple way to explain the principles to you - but there really isn’t a simple way.
Therefore, I'tl just do the best I can.

This section of the book shows how cycles unfold on a daily basis. How planets take
prices by the hand and lead them up and down on the charts, or around and around on the
wheel. Commodities, like people, all have their own individual characteristics, each one
responding somewhat differently to the planets. This makes it necessary to have a set of rules
for each commodity. (Wouldn't you know!)

Sugar has somewhat more simple cycles when compared to other commodities, so
obviously I'll start with Sugar. For daily and short term trading purposes Sugar responds well to
the planet Jupiter. In order to watch Jupiter’s role in Sugar prices we first need to have some
price data. This data will be taken from Chart 25A July 1993 Sugar. We'll start on March 22,
1993, this was the top of a trend run up, price on that date was low 12.30 to 13.00 high. (All
prices will be taken directly from the chart and rounded to the nearest .05.}

STEP 1. Place the numbers 12.30 to 13.00 on the price wheel of Figure 28. Circle
these numbers and draw a connecting line to join them. | usually use a green pen to circle all

my prices. Now price for March 22 is on the wheel, it is ready to be compared to the planetary
positions on that day.

R = Planet is Retrograde, reducing in number in future days.

* = Mercury went into Direct Motion today, after being Retrograde for three weeks. This is
important, | will come back to this point later. Use the Conversion Table to convert planets to
whole degrees ready to place on time wheel.

STEP 3. For the moment take only the positions of Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus.
Place them onto the time wheel Figure 29. Circle the planets with colored pens. | have
assigned a specific color to each planet, | always use the same color, this reduces the
confusion of what all those numbers mean. It enables me (and you too, once you are familiar
with it) to see as well as understand the whole picture at a glance. Insert price on March 22,
flow 12.30 to high 13.00 into the price wheel.
Now the planets and price are on the Universal Clock, what next? First, know that price is
drawn to where the planets are placed. Sugar is especially attracted to Jupiter. On March 22
the high price of the day is opposite to the position of Jupiter. Note, that there is a small arrow
on the circled Jupiter, showing it is in backward motion, moving to 190 in coming days. The
high of price that day, is opposite 190. The opposition to Jupiter stopped price from going
higher. If you took at Chart 25A, you will notice that this was the high bar of the trend run up.
Price reversed on March 22 and started moving down. Where will price go when it moves
down? To Jupiter of course! But more on this later. Let's finish talking about March 22 first.

The next thing to recognize is that Uranus and Neptune held the low of price on this date.
Uranus and Neptune move very slowly and are together for all of 1993, making this area a
strong stopping or pause point for price all year in all commodities.

Trading Range Mar 22

STEP 4. Since Uranus and Neptune move extremely slowly, and at this point, while
Jupiter is Retrograde, it is also traveling slowly, about 1° per week. This means that the three
planets will be in pretty much the same positions the whole week of March 22. For this reason
it will not be necessary to use a new clock for each day of the week. We can put a whole
week's worth of data on the one wheel as shown on Figure 30.

To avoid total confusion of how price is moving around the wheel during the week, each

day’s price range is in a different color. If | am only looking at one day's price, | color the price ~

green. Otherwise the price on the first day of each week is green.

The price ranges for the week are as follows:

(Off Chart 25A} Figure 30
March 23 price = 12.15 to 12.40

March 24 price = 11.85 to 12.15
March 25 price = 11.75 to 12.25

THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK™
by Jeanne Long

Note on Figure 30, how price worked its way back to Jupiter by March 25!

On March 23 price started its move back towards Jupiter and Uranus/Neptune held the
low of the day.

March 24 price reached Jupiter. Jupiter today has moved back to the 190 point.

By March 25, Jupiter held the low and the price took off back up to Uranus and Neptune
for the high of the day. Where is price headed now? To Jupiter's opposite point of course!
You'll note that price will go up to one point past the planets in the direction the planet is
moving. This is quite normal. Whenever a price stops in the segment of, or the segment
before or after the planet, it is responding to the planet. Remember the planets are moving
and so is the price. For simplicities sake | have rounded out price and rounded out positions
of the planets. This is the reason we allow price to be one segment before or after the
segment the planet is placed in. Otherwise additional refinement of price and degrees of
planets is needed and that's another chapter.

| have also included the price data of March 17 and 18 to give you a clear picture of what
has actually happened in this whole cycle.

March 17 price = 11.40 to 11.75

March 18 price = 12.00 to 12.70

The diagram below will help clarify the movement of price in retationship to planet.

The Jupiter/price cycle March 17 to April 5, 1993.

Now you can see how price is drawn to the planet. But, there are important questions to
be answered before continuing on, because its not quite as simple as it looks. First, prior to
March 17, the price of Sugar was on the other side of Jupiter. How come Jupiter didn’t stop
price and send it back the other way? How did price get past Jupiter? Good questions.

On March 18 Jupiter was at 11° Libra 22’ = 191° = a Sugar price of 11.90. On March 17
price was 11.40 to 11.75, did not quite reach Jupiter on that day. March 18 gave a price range
of 12.00 to 12.70. What happened here? Price jumped over Jupiter! Price did not trade at
the Jupiter number of 11.90! That is one way for price to get past a planet and thereby
enabling price to move on to new highs or lows. Another way for price to pass Jupiter, Uranus
and Neptune is with the help of the other planets. Remember earlier we talked about price
movements being rather like a relay race, where price gets handed off from one planet to the
next? Well, this is an important component of the unfoiding of price. However, where Sugar is
concerned, Jupiter sets the pace and cycle, while Uranus/Neptune tend to create the high or
low of day.

Figure 31 illustrates time wheel with all planets in place for March 22. (These planetary
positions are listed under STEP 2 at the beginning of this chapter.

Points to remember:

1. The Sun is moving at approximately 1° per day or through one segment of the wheel per
day. In one week the Sun will have traveled through seven segments. Mercury and Venus
have a speed of slightly more or less than 1° per day depending on whether they are in
Retrograde or Direct Motion. Mars moves less than 1° per day. Mercury, Sun, Venus and Mars
are the planets to watch handing price off to or from the slower moving planets.

2. Another point to remember, especially regarding the four fast moving planets is that when
they go over the 24-line of the wheel, that is a signal for a change of trend for price. Watch for
price being stopped by a slower moving planet on dates of Mercury, Sun, Venus and Mars. in
other words, when one of these planets is on the 24-line, price may not reach Jupiter to
complete its usual cycle but instead may reverse. Unless of course, price is very close to
Jupiter at the time, otherwise price can be stopped by any of the planets.

3. The days when Mercury or Venus move into Retrograde or Direct Motion also signal
reversal dates for Sugar. Use these dates in combination with all the other information.

4. The dates of Mercury, Venus or Mars changing signs also triggers reversals in Sugar.
These dates are shown in the ephemeris, they occur when the planets reach 0° of any sign.
Look at Figure 32, April 1993 ephemeris page, Mercury was 0° on April 16. This means that
Mercury changed signs sometime between April 15/16. An important reversal date.

Bearing all the above in mind we are now ready to look at all the other planets in the time
wheel on Figure 31.

March 22. Mercury changed direction today, into forward motion. This signaled a change
of trend. Price was on its way to the Jupiter opposition point and Uranus/Neptune and
Mercury formed the low of the day. Mercury's change in direction signaled that the trend run
up would terminate when price reaches the opposite point to Jupiter. Note Mars was in the
segment close to the high of price. Mars and Jupiter in this case worked in tandem to stop
price. On Sunday, March 21, the Sun was at 0° Aries on the 24-line, another signal of a price
reversal for Monday. All factors totaled together created price reversal.

March 23 as price now headed back towards Jupiter, Uranus/Neptune and Mercury held
the high price of the day and pushed it down towards Jupiter. Also on this day the Sun was
moving from 2° to 3° of Aries. The Sun drew price down from Uranus/Neptune to send on its
way to Jupiter.

March 24, price reached Jupiter and continue to trade near Jupiter until March 26. On that
day, Jupiter held price which started to move up towards the opposite point of Jupiter.

By March 29th, price had reached its regular stop over at Uranus/Neptune, where price
put in the high.

From March 30 to April 5 price worked between Uranus/Neptune and opposite point to
Jupiter. During this time price was also correlating with Mercury’s position. From March 30 to
Friday April 3, Mercury traveled from 12° 42’ to 14° 50° of Pisces = 343° to 345° or in Sugar
price terms 12.70 to 12.90. Mercury held the highs during this period. By Monday, April 5,
Mercury had now moved to 17° 21' Pisces or 13.10 in price. In other words, Mercury was now
t

way past the Jupiter's opposition point and Jupiter held sway causing price to reverse and
head down. (On April 5, Jupiter was at 189°.) Another important point was Mars and Saturn
came together on the wheel on April 6/7 price fell rapidly look at Figure 32 and you figure it
out.

Price now heads back towards Jupiter position again. It reached it on April 7th. This time
price did not reverse and go up, instead on April 8 it went lower. Why?

as Necessary, you can find that on Figure 32. Obviously, | can't put one monthe worth of
Planetary Information on one wheel, It would be too cluttered to use, By making coples you
can work up one week at a time.

THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK™

by Jeanne Long

“
The first answer is that Mars/Saturn were still together on April 8th. This combination
produces sharp moves as discussed in a previous chapter. When Mars and Saturn are
together on the day price reached Jupiter, price is released from Jupiter. Jupiter created the_
high of the bar on April 8 while Mars and Saturn at 111° and 327° respectively, (in terms of price
=1it.t0) gave the low of the day at 11.15!! This Mars/Saturn point is opposite
Uranus/Neptune, very strong blocking point to stop price from moving much iower.

The second answer is the placement of the Sun on April 8th at 18° 10’ Aries, two
segments lower than Jupiter. The Sun drew price down from Jupiter, it will do this even when
Mars/Saturn are not in effect. Mercury was also there in the same segment with the Sun at
330. When price is this ciose to Mercury it will go to it. Added to this, Mercury is also changing
signs.

Between April 8th and April 14, price traded back and forth over Saturn/Mars and stuck to
it like glue, and also opposite Uranus/Neptune. By April 15 the Sun and Mercury had reached
the 24-line, Sun at 25° Aries and Mercury moving into 0° Aries on that day - this was a change
of trend signal.

April 15 was the low of the trend run down just as Mercury/Sun indicated, and where
did price push off from? Why of course 10.85 which was the opposite point to the 24-line in
other words, Mercury/Sun! Under these terms price didn't get to opposite point of Jupiter, but
instead started to head back to actual Jupiter's place on the wheel. Price was too far away to
reach the opposite point to Jupiter. Therefore the change of trend signals from Sun/Mercury
terminated the price move down.

On April 19th price trades past Jupiter which is now at 187° = 11.50 in terms of price.
Sugar price on April 19 is low 11.20 to 11.70 high. The price went two segments past Jupiter,
this indicates price is going higher. Why did price go past Jupiter? Mars was passing Jupiter
on April 19 at 115° to 116° on the time wheel. Mars took price with it. And off we go again to
the opposite side of Jupiter!

| have not been able to cover every aspect of Sugar price trading with Jupiter and the
other planets. You really must be willing to sit down and work with it yourself to really see how
price and planets go through the same motions over and over again. Figure 33 is a blank
wheel for you to use for copies. By working through one day at a time, from March 17 to April

19, you will develop a feel for the unfolding of the price cycles.

Chart 258 illustrates the same Jupiter/price cycle, in other words, looking at the same
picture but from a different angle. Jupiter's position from the time wheel, is now Placed on the
Sugar chart by way of Jupiter lines. The point opposite to Jupiter, the 1/2 way point of the
cycle, is marked as a dotted line. This opposite point is always 1/2 way between two Jupiter
lines. This chart enables you to get the picture visually. You can see how Price swings out
from the Jupiter line to the dotted line and back. However, this chart does not reveal the inner
workings of the unfolding cycies as the daily wneel does. The Universa! Clock adds a whole
new dimension for unraveling price movements. Without the wheel this information would
remain a mystery.

This information can be combined with predicted price data in Chapters 1 and 3. It will
certainly give you the tools to predict the second date with ease. Chapter 8 pulls together all
of the other chapters in the book, for a complete look at the unfolding of price on a daily basis.
Any one or all of the astro-tools can easily be integrated with your own technical tools.

The description of the unfolding of price cycles in tandem with the planets will give you a
good idea of how the information in Chapter 8 works with all the other commodities. However,
each commodity and stock has its own individual planet planetary combinations. Just as
Jupiter leads Sugar, other planets play key roles in the development of price cycles with the
other commodities and stocks. This means a whole set of rules is necessary for each
commodity and stock. However, all the planets must always be taken into consideration. |
realize this takes time to do and is not an easy task in the beginning. But 1can promise you, if
you will just work with it on a daily basis, you will soon have a feel for the key planets for the
commodity of your choice. For those who don't want to do all the research, Book I! will have
ample illustrations of planets taking price by the hand in ail commodities and stocks plus the
tules for each,

Book 1! will aiso cover the aspects of the Universal Clock not covered in this book,
including how the Heliocentric planets function within the clock. Book | has mainly
concentrated on the daily portion of the clock. Book II will detail the intraday, monthly and
yearly cycles, along with much more information on time and price coming together.

It is clear to see from what has been covered so far that the multifaceted Universal Clock is
set in motion by the movemenis of the planets. The price tags along for the ride. The clock
explains how the markets work and why. It clarifies the expanding and contracting nature of
price cycies. Without the Universal Clock opening the door to a whole new way of looking at
markets and price, these expanding and contracting price cycles are almost impossible to find.
The very fact that the markets do have irregular cycles, creates the perfect marriage of planets
and price. This is one case where irregularity makes predictability.

More importantly for the trader, the Universal Clock provides the key to unlock the price
and time secrets.
