FOREWORD

F*” of us can understand why the all-important relationship
between astrology and finance has been so completely neglected.
Despite the importance of the progress in other branches of
astrology, the student and investor has not, until now, been able
to delve deeply into the roots of financial astrology. The reason
for this, we believe, is a lack of scientific information. It is the
intention of this book to afford such knowledge.

This book is in no sense of the word the complete text on the
subject. It does aim to present in factual form an outstanding
new theory of financial astrology. It also attempts to trace the
operation of this theory upon the investor's possibilities in the
stock market.

Louise McWhirter, well known financial and economic analyst,
is a veteran writer who has contributed many important treatises
to the science of astrology. She was at one time editor-in-chief
of a nationally-known astrological publication, which post she
resigned to devote her energies to research in the very much mis-
understood field of financial astrology. In back of this step was
her life-long desire to develop het original theory of Astronomics.
Tt was during this formative period, while Miss McWhirter was
compiling important financial statistics, that this volume found its
genesis. From that moment, no fact which had a bearing on the
Astronomic theory was untested or overlooked. The herculean
task of preparing detailed financial graphs, checking them daily
against financial fluctuations and astrological findings, continued
for more than seven years. Today the author is convinced beyond
a doubt that this work is complete and satisfactory.

The subject matter is new and original. Its purpose is to give
a sound astrological key to financial investors. However, even
if this book is not to be used as a guide in financial investment,
the authority and freshness of its approach should make it a wel-
come addition to the library of every sincere student of astrology.
We earnestly believe that with diligent application and accurate
calculation much benefit and personal gain can be sechred from
the McWhirter theory.

 


 

Introduction

Economists and politicians regularly promise to elimi-
nate all those familiar “‘boom or bust” cyclic patterns by
governmental fine tuning. While this is a most admirable
goal, astrologers and other students of cycles know that there
is a constant fluctuation between alternating periods of
optimism (bullishness) and pessimism (bearishness) in eco-
nomic and business life. Rather than attempt to alter this es-
sential rhythm, it is far wiser to take advantage of these
swings in mood or mass feeling and tailor activities accord-
ingly. Astrology offers the investors and traders a unique tool
for timing these changes and indicating their direction.

Louise McWhirter’s book ASTROLOGY AND STOCK
MARKET FORECASTING is a superb source of information
and techniques for those who not only have the requisite as-
trological knowledge but also the experience in trading.
However, there are several other important factors that the
would-be trader must take into consideration.

Before you rush out with her book in hand to your
nearest broker, please read on this distillate of wisdom from
one who has paid her tuition for knowledge in this special-
ized field. I have made money and I have lost money trading
commodities, puts and calls (long before they were as pop-
ular as they are today) and stocks. I would dearly love to
credit my successes to me and my superior techniques and
my failures to bad companions, but if I am to be honest and

i


 

 
 

extract something useful from the experience to pass on, I
have to admit my complicity in the disasters and analyze
them meticulously.

Therefore, the best piece of advice I can offer anyone
who intends to try to make money in the stock and commodi-
ty markets is, “know thyself” intimately, not only through in-
formation gained from a careful study of your own natal
chart but also through a careful analysis of your behavior,
your attitudes and motivations, your needs and, finally, your
greed quotient. You will have to ask yourself searching ques-
tions and answer them honestly, even if the answers do not
exactly agree with that ideal image of yourself. To the extent
that you answer truthfully you will be in a better position to
know whether you have the necessary talents and qualities of
personality to function effectively in this emotion-laden area.

The capacity for objectivity and detachment is ab-
solutely essential to avoid the most common error made by
“market losers’ —that of identifying with the position taken.
This is likely to occur when you feel that the stock or com-
modity must go up (or down) because you have bought (or
sold). Perhaps that stock or commodity does not feel like go-
ing up (or down) at the moment, and the fact that you have
bought (or sold) will not influence its course one whit. In-
deed, markets in general are singularly unimpressed with the
identity of either buyer or seller. Although it is difficult to ad-
mit that one has made an error either in judgment or timing
(timing errors can be just as serious), failures and mistakes
are inherent in the human condition. Efforts to prove that
one is immune to the working out of this law by hanging onto
mistaken trades can be very costly.

Analyses of traders, both the successful and unsuccess-
ful ones, done by brokerage houses, have shown that money-
making traders do not have more right trades than wrong
trades. However, they do close out their mistaken ones more
quickly and allow the correct ones to run on profitably until

Fst

 

 

 

there is a change in the situation. In other words, those who
make money in these markets are not afraid to admit error
and take small iosses from time to time when they are wrong.
They rarely become so emotionally involved that they
“marry their positions.” You must therefore ask yourself
whether you can admit to mistakes without your basic securi-
ty being jeopardized. Unless you have cultivated this ability,
stay away from trading.

How is your patience quotient? If this is not your forte,
perhaps you will do better making money in another field. As
we say endlessly, without really hearing what it is that we are
saying, “there is a time for everything’. Nowhere is this
aphorism more valid than in the money markets. Saturn is
the lord of both patience and timing as well as success in
trading. Can you sit out a correct position until it has gone as
far as it can profitably or are you in mortal terror that the
profits will evaporate? The saturnian qualities of careful in-
vestigation before investing and moderation in expectations
rather than the negative qualities of fearfulness and greed
must predominate to insure good results.

Are you impulsive? If you are, and have not learned to
curb its excessive manifestations, you will find yourself in
some rather unfortunate financial positions which could
have been avoided with a little forethought. You may be
lucky occasionally, but luck is a very slim reed to lean on for
long-term trading. If Mars and Jupiter are doing dynamic
things to each other in your chart, look out for a tendency to
be impulsive; otherwise, you may be more likely to lose your
shirt than make a fortune.

Are you highly suggestible? If you are, but have the re-
quisite qualities otherwise, this is not a total bar to trading.
However, it is a cautionary sign that you will have to stay
away from people when you are studying the pros and cons
of the situation, trying to decide which position, if any, to
take. There will be touts on every corner and in every broker-

iti

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

    
      


age house and you are more easily influenced than most. Al-
ways bear in mind that it is your money at stake. If all these
people knew so much, they would be so unbelievably wealthy
that they would not be bothering to offer you advice. Inter-
estingly enough, this very susceptibility to outside influence
can be a tremendous asset in trading if used advantageously
to sense general business and market conditions and trends.
However, one must be very still, away from all outside pres-
sure and suggestions, and listen to that internal knowing
which will point to the correct decision.

Finally, and perhaps most important of all, you must
calculate your greed quotient. Unless you are willing to settle
for returns on your trading operations commensurate with
your risk and original investment, you are likely to incur the
additional trading hazard of greed. This trait can subvert the
most carefully planned strategy because, when it is in full
bloom, one loses all sense of proportion and judgment. To
avoid any possibility that greed can destroy your financial
success, always plot very carefully, before taking the posi-
tion, what would be a reasonable return on your investment
of time and money and for the most part, stay with that fig-
ure.

MUNDANE ASTROLOGY

Now that you have completed your self-appraisal and
decided that you have the required personality qualifica-
tions, it is time to consider the extent of your knowledge of
mundane astrology. This specialized area is concerned with
the application of astrological knowledge and techniques to
the larger groups, i.e., cities, states, nations and money mar-
kets. It is particularly involved in the analysis of lunations
(monthly new and full moons), eclipses, synodic conjunctions
and planetary cycles as they depict world-wide trends and
attitudes affecting everyone. The immediate impact of, for

iv

example, Saturn in aspect with the Sun and Moon of an
eclipse will affect everyone, but the particular area of life
will vary from one place to another, depending upon house
location and rulership. Saturn in aspect with a monthly luna-
tion will have a much more limited influence, lasting only the
time until the next lunation.

One of the most important business indicants is the
periodic (about every 20 years) synodic conjunction of the so-
called “business planets”, Jupiter and Saturn. An analysis of
‘the conjunction chart itself plus the knowledge of their cur-
rent interrelationship can be used to time periods of expan-
sion as well as those of contraction and consolidation. Ig-
norance of this constant tidal pattern leads the unwary to
over-expand during periods of optimism and, like the fabled
grasshopper, to be unprepared for the inevitable rainy day. If
the qualities of these planets are handled properly, there is
enough expansion to prevent stagnation, but sufficient mod-
eration and foresight to secure the advances.

C.C. Zain in his book MUNDANE ASTROLOGY de-
scribes the technique for setting up and interpreting cycle
charts of the planets from Mars outwards. These charts are
read solely in terms of the planet for which they are erected.
The transit aspects of that planet describe activity until a
new cycle chart is made. While he shows an interpolative
technique for timing the change-over from south to north
declination the cycle chart is based on the time of entrance of
a planet into north declination), I have learned that there
may be several hours or days difference in time between the
figure so calculated and that obtained from your local astro-
nomical society. Since this chart is to be used as one of many
predictive tools, it is extremely important to secure as ac-
curate a time as possible. In the fall of 1973 several of these
cycle charts were activated by their particular planets. The
Neptune, Pluto, Saturn and Uranus charts were very busy
during this period.


  

 
  

At the American Federation of Astrologers’ Convention
in Seattle (1968) Louise G. Mench gave an interesting talk on
stock market trading. The gist of her comments is that the in-
formation as to one’s luck or lack thereof in trading lies in a
thorough study of the individual’s natal chart with particular
attention to the planets in the fifth house and aspects to other
planets. If these planets are in stressful aspect to planets in
the seventh house or the ruler thereof, it is much safer to do
any speculation alone. Partners will in one way or another
involve one in poor judgment and/or timing. If all the above
indications are reversed, then working with partners will
generally prove beneficial in trading operations.

Many individuals have charts that indicate an ability
for managing money for others, but not for themselves. They
should content themselves with the smaller rewards paid to
money managers. They usually are excellent advisors. Again,
there are those whose charts point to a very different way of
earning a livelihood and they should resist the temptation of
trading.

Apart from these general astrological considerations,
there is one extremely important calculation to make and
that is one for the “fatal flaw” point not only in your chart,
but also in the chart of the stock or election chart. This point
is called the Mars/Neptune mid-point,* and refers to that
area in each chart where there is likely to be great disap-
pointment because of miscalculation or unrealistic expecta-
tions as well as inherent susceptibility to error. The point is
found by adding the longitudes of Mars and Neptune and di-
viding by two. If this mid-point is aspected in your chart by
current lunations or eclipses, it is a warning to you to exercise
extreme caution in your affairs during the ensuing period. If

 
 
 

*The Mars/Neptune sum used by Uranian astrologers is also valid. This
sensitive point is found by adding the longitudes of Mars and Neptune.

 

 

 
 

this mid-point is activated in the foundation chart of some
company stock you are considering, you should make a very
careful analysis of current market activity and recent stock-
holder reports before risking your money.

MARKET TRADING

While I do not intend to write a discourse on trading, as
there are excellent books covering this subject in great depth
and detail, I do feel that readers of this book should study this
technical material and not rely solely on astrological knowl-
edge. It is necessary to understand how mass psychology af-
fects not only markets, but also individuals and be able to
translate this information into skill in manipulation and tim-

Within the past twenty years there has developed a very
popular method of trading in commodities called “contrary
opinion”. In short, this technique is based upon the reality
that excesses bring corrections, or, as one broker I knew used
to say, “When everyone gets on the same horse, the horse
does not go very far.”” When bullish sentiment begins to ap-
proach the 90 percent level, it is about time to sell and, con-
versely, when bearish feeling reaches this same 90 percent
level, it is time to buy. This is very logical, but seldom re-
membered by traders. If everyone wants to sell and no one
wants to buy, or vice versa, there is an imbalance in the mar-
ket and the direction of the market is about to change.

Normal bullish tendency is rated at about 65% since
most people feel more secure having something or buying.
Furthermore, individuals generally feel that there is some-
thing slightly immoral about going ‘‘short” or selling in the
expectation of later being able to buy at a lower price. A
great deal of money can be made in markets if the trader can
overcome this built-in bullish bias and short stocks or com-

   
   

olt

 

 


modities that are about to go down in price. This path takes
strong nerves because, theoretically, there is no limit to the
losses if one is mistaken.

The further techniques of correlating astrological in-
formation and business charts are wel} described by Louise
McWhirter in her book. The use of the nodal axis to deter-
mine over-all bullish and bearish tendencies is her unique
contribution to this fascinating stock and commodity market

game.

In summary and as an aide-memoire, I want to close
with the well-known Wall Street aphorism: ‘‘Bulls make
money, bears make money and hogs lose.”

Chapter I

Theory and Application of Forecasting
Stock Market Trends

IP HE theory of forecasting future trends of the Stock Matket
and the trend of business, as outlined in this book, is based on
sound astronomical law. The law is here; it need only be applied
to bring economic independence and a more abundant living
to every man and woman in this country.

‘The way conditions exist today man is the victim of the business
cycle. With detailed charts and graphs, he can tell you when busi-
ness began to pick up, and when a recession started, but he cannot
tell you those factors in advance, with all his statistical research,
because he has no time factor.

A leading economist, Col. Leonard P. Ayres, of the Cleveland
Trust Company, in a booklet entitled "Business Recovery Follow-
ing Depression” states in a paragraph that "Positive Forecasting”
is impossible despite the fact that all booms and depressions
have a certain similarity. There is always 2 new factor present
which was not present in the last depression or previous depres-
sions. To quote:

“The explanation of this lack of uniformity is to be found ia
the variety of the fundamentel conditioning factors that may con-
trol the developments and outcomes of these business swings.
Chicf among these is agricultural production which powerfully
affects the general prosperity of the country. War is another con-
trolling factor which cannot be foreseen. The prosperity of peoples
in other lands is still another of the influences that powerfully
modify conditions in this country.

“Since these and other factors cannot be foretold, it is impossible
to construct a reliable method for making statistical forecasts of
finance and business.”

[3]

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

The theory of this book, however, makes the forecasting with
accuracy of all of the above hitherto unknown factors, by the
study of the angular relation of the planetary bodies to each other
as they transit the twelve signs of the zodiac.

It is 2 well-known fact that certain countries are “ruled” by
certain signs of the zodiac. That is, from observation and re-
search, it has been found that a planet passing through a certain
sign has a very definite bearing on the fortunes of a particular
country. For example, the United States is strongly under the
influence of the signs Gemini and Cancer and planets passing
through these two signs have a very definite effect upon the busi-
ness conditions of this country depending of course on the
nature of the planet. These planetary transits can be known years
in advance. ‘The same is true of war conditions, crop conditions,
booms, recessions, etc., the angular relation of the planetary
bodies forecasting the conditions.

The Ecliptic is the Sun's path. A planet crossing this path
moves from South latitude to North latitude and from North
latitude to South latitude. The word “node” is the name for the
points in the orbit of a planet where it crosses the Ecliptic, or
Sun's path. The point where it crosses from south to north is
the North Node; and the point where it crosses from north to
south is called the South Node. The Moon’s Nodes have a
cycle of nineteen years. That is, it takes them nineteen years
to pass through the twelve signs of the zodiac. The trend of
the Business Volume Curve has been found to correspond with
the cycle of the North Node. In this theory, the transit of the
North Node forms the basic trend of business activity and vol-
ume. Secondary planetary factors can distort this Curve ten to
twenty per cent above or below the normal line depending upon
the nature of the planet and the angles formed. Business Cycles,
as portrayed on the Chart “A Century of Business Progress” by
Col. Leonard P, Ayres, is used on a comparative basis with the
transit of the North Node portraying the major trend of business
volume and activity. Planetary aspects or angles to the North

Node and to each other form the secondary trend. In other

[4]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

words, the major trend of Business Activity is clearly shown by
the movement of the North Node around the Business Cycle
Chart (see chart on page 6).

Whenever the North Node passes through Scorpio and Libra
(the North Node moves backward through the zodiac), business
goes through an approximate three year “transition period,” if
there are no unfavorable secondary factors present to distort the
Business Activity Curve; business volume is going from normal
to above normal, creating a prosperity period or the beginning
of a Bull Market in stock prices as well as other forms of busi-
ness. Whenever the North Node teaches the sign of Leo, Busi-
ness Volume is normally at a high point, if there are no second-
ary factors present of an unfavorable nature to distort the Curve.
As the North Node passes through Cancer and Gemini, Business
roe is ready fac but the trend is slowly toward normal.

favorable secon factors can prolong this prosperi iod
beyond the allotted time and unfavorable secoudaty fartces c can
decrease the length of the favorable period.

Whenever the North Node moves into Taurus, a “transition
period” begins which lasts through the sign of Aries, which is
apptoximately about three years. This is a warning that the
somal position of the Business Volume Curve has been reached
and that the trend of Business activity is slowly going from nor-
mal to below normal for the next three or four years.

. In 1929, the North Node was in Taums and had been there
since December, 1928, giving the warning six to eight months
in advance that the Bull Market Boom was nearing its end.
Jupiter was in Taurus in conjunction with the Nosth Node in
May and June of 1929, a favorable secondary factor which sent
the Business Curve upward six points through June. However,
when this aspect passed, the Curve dropped and remained below
normal for four years until the North Node passed out of the
sign Aquarius, which is the sign on the low point of the Business
Cycle Chact. According to this theory all these factors were pre-
dictable in advance years ahead of the actual happening, No
Administration was responsible for the Depression and no Ad-

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

ministration is responsible for the Recovery according to this
theory, which is based on the Law of Action and Reaction. The
“teal” recovery began in February, 1935, when the North Node
moved out of Aquarius, the sign on the low point of the Business
Cycle Chart. A favorable secondary factor, Saturn sextile Uranus,
was also present during a two-year period and this sent stock
market prices and business activity higher than they normally
would have been. In August, 1937, when the present recession
set in, the North Node was in Sagittarius, and the normal posi-
tion of the Business Volume Curve was slightly below normal.
At the same time Saturn placed on the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart indicated lower prices for stocks
and bonds. When this planet formed an unfavorable forty-five
degree angle to Uranus, Stock Market prices began to plummet.

In April, 1938, Saturn moved to a slightly favorable angle
with Uranus (thirty degrees) and the North Node moved into
Scorpio, the transition point on the Business Cycle Chart, indicat-
ing that the technical “normal” point has been reached by the
Business Curve, and with the slightly favorable secondary factor
present, stocks should go up next year as Jupiter passes over
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart, and
Business Volume should rise toward the normal line during most
of 1939.

THE THEORY

The major or primary trend of business volume and finance is
clearly pointed out by the nineteen-year cycle of the North Node
as it passes through the twelve signs of the zodiac.

Whenever the North Node passes through Scorpio and Libra,
there is a transition period as the Curve passes from normal,
going from norma] to high.

The high point of business volume is reached when the North
Node transits Leo. As the North Node goes through Cancer and
Gemini, Business volume is above normal, but slowly going to
normal,

Taurus is the transition point or normal point as the Curve

{7}

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

goes from normal to below normal in business volume.

When the North Node enters Aquarius, the low point of
Business activity has been reached. As the Node transits Capri-
corn and Sagittarius, the normal position of the Business Curve
is below normal going to normal.

This is the natural position of the Curve without the presence
of secondary factors which can distort the Curve favorably or
unfavorably from one to twenty per cent.

The following secondary factors have been found to lift the
Business Curve:

1. Jupiter conjunction the North Node.

2. Saturn trine, sextile, or semi-sextile Uranus.

3. Jupiter in Gemini or Cancer.

4. Jupiter in conjunction, sextile or trine aspect to Saturn and
Uranus, which are in aspect to each other.

5. The North Node in Gemini.

6. Favorable aspects to Pluto.

The following secondary factors have been found to depress
the Business Curve:

1. Saturn conjunction the North Node; square or opposition
to it.
2, Saturn conjunction, square, opposition, or semi-square
Uranus.
. Saturn in Gemini.
. Uranus in Gemini.
. Uranus square, conjunction, opposition the North Node.
. Unfavorable aspects to Pluto.

A combination of any of these factors give strength for what-
ever they indicate. If one or more favorable secondaty factors
are present they take the Curve upward. If one or more unfavor-
able secondary factors are present they turn the Curve downward.
If one good and one unfavorable secondary factor is also present,
the effect of the secondary factors is to neutralize each other, or
to counteract the effects of the various factors involved.

THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

The trend of stock market prices tends to conform to the major
trend of the Business Curve. However, the Stock Market is under
a set of individual conditions of its own. These governing plane-
tary factors may be told by studying the Chart of the New York
Stock Exchange as originated by the writer. Planets on the
angles of the New York Stock Exchange Chart clearly indicate
Market conditions. Aspects favorable and unfavorable between
Saturn and Uranus or Pluto, definitely indicate stock trends; and
aspects between Mars and Neptune, the two planetary rulers of
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart, and
the aspects from other major planets to Mars and Neptune, indi-
cate what the Stock Market price averages will do. These are
taken up in detail in Chapter III. Chapter II shows how Stock
Market trends and Business Cycles are cortelated.

APPLICATION

The practical application of this theory should bring eco-
nomic independence to a greater number of people than ever
before. It shows how to analyze, years in advance, business
conditions; crops, wars, and other factors which have such an
important effect upon security prices. It shows you when to get
out of the Market and when to get in, which are two of the
more important things a trader must know.

Everything needed for the study of this theory is contained in
this book and can be practically applied.

The rise and fall of Stock Market prices come in definite
intervals of time or cycles which follow the Curve of Business
Volume and activity. This rise and fall of prices is governed by
the law of supply and demand, which in turn is governed by a
law in the universe, hitherto unknown or ignored, known as the
Law of Action and Reaction. Periods of business prosperity and
depression ate not man made nor the result of chance; they
come at regular intervals, the same as the seasons, and the same
astronomical laws which govern nature, govern man and all of
man’s activities. When this fact is recognized, man will work

[9]

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

in harmony with the forces of nature and not blindly against
them,

At the present time, a planned investment program based on
the laws of nature which govern supply and demand is an
unheard of thing. It is not, however, an impossibility in the near
future. When man turns from disturbing political factors long
enough to see that business volume and the fluctuations of the
Stock Market defy Administrative control, they will begin to
wonder what is the law behind it all. No Administration can
make depression and no Administration can make prosperity.
Business Cycles occur of their own accord at regular intervals
despite the Government. However, by acknowledging the law
of nature behind this theory, administrative heads in the future
can plan ahead for depressions and not be caught in the midst of
prosperity by a changed Business Cycle and a financial panic.
When this sort of preparedness takes place, the time will come
when there are no depressions because man has already prepared
for a rainy day and has more than enough to tide him over lean
years. When the Cycle changes and the Business Curve starts
upward again, man will be able to invest again and like the

farmer watch his seed grow. It is no longer necessary to be wiped
out on the Stock Market. That is a sign of ignorance.

Business Cycles and Stock Market Trends
1850-1950

THE CALIFORNIA GOLD INFLATION
PROSPERITY PERIOD

Tes period takes in the years of 1850 to 1854 inclusively.
Reference to a table called an Ephemeris, which gives the geo-
centric planetary positions for this period, shows that the North
Node is in Leo, the sign which is on the highest point of the
Business Cycle Chart. Since the Node indicates the trend or curve
of business activity and volume as it passes through the respective
twelve signs on the chart, it is easy to see that for business activity
and volume this period was characterized by “above normal
Prices.”

In 1850 prices rose from Normal to 11 points above Normal
in January, 1851. During 1851 prices began to drop due to
the influence as shown by the conjunction of the planet Saturn
and Uranus, secondary factors, which can distort the Business
Activity Curve from 10% to 20% either way depending upon
the nature of the aspect. This aspect was very unfavorable and
prices dropped in stocks and bonds as well as business until
October, 1851, when these planets had moved out of orb of
each other, Since the Node was still in Leo, indicating that busi-
ness volume would increase as soon as the secondary factor was
out of the way, prices began to go up and prices had a steady
climb through 1852 reaching 10 points above normal in business
activity. The year 1853 saw business volume eight points above
normal and the curve going to a high of 15 points above normal
through March, 1854.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

In April of 1854, another secondary factor appeared to cause
a temporary business recession. Saturn moved into the sign of
Gemini which rules the United St&tes. This in itself would
cause business volume to recede, but it also happens that the
Node moving backward in its orbit had also gone into the sign
of Gemini. Saturn in conjunction with the North Node caused
the Business Curve to turn downward sharply reaching a low of
four points below Normal in December, 1854. Stock prices also
dropped during this period.

As the North Node goes from Leo to Taurus on the Business
Cycle Chart, it is easy to see that the Curve of Business activity
is going slowly but surely from “Above Normal” to “Normal.”
In other words, in the midst of so-called prosperity the influence
is slowly at work which will swing the trend of business in the
opposite direction, after the Node reaches the sign of Taurus,
which is the transition point, as prices and the Business Curve
work slowly from “Normal” to “Below Normal” in prices.

THE PANIC OF 1857

In June of 1854 the North Node passed in Taurus, which
indicated that the Economic Curve of business was now moving
slowly from Normal to “Below Normal.” The period of passing
through the signs of Taurus and Aries was a Transition Period
and marks the years from 1854 to 1857 as a Transition Era,
despite the fact that business volume was 10 points above Normal
during the middle of 1856. This was due to the presence of a
favorable secondary factor, Jupiter in Pisces. Pisces is the sign
which governs the topmost point on the chart of the New York
Stock Exchange and shows business conditions at large. Jupiter
was also in conjunction with the North Node and with Neptune,
the planetary ruler of Pisces. The combination of these factors
showed the above normal business activity during 1856. Stocks
were up and business was very good.

In February, 1857, Saturn was square the North Node, al-
though Jupiter was in conjunction with it. This caused 2 drop
of three points in Business volume and as Saturn was in Cancer

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

during all of 1857 it was passing over the Ascendant of the
chart of the New York Stock Exchange, a critical point for show-
ing action on the New York Stock Exchange. Stock prices
dropped all spring and summer and business volume shrank
during this period culminating in the fall in a sharp drop which
carried business volume thirteen points below Normal. This was
known as the Panic of 1857. Economists attribute this Panic
to over development in the West and excessive railroad construc-
tion during this period. The Panic was clearly shown, however,
by the fact that the lunation (conjunction of the Sun and Moon
every twenty-eight days) for September fell in 25 degrees Virgo
in exact opposition to the Mid-heaven of the New York Stock
Exchange and in exact opposition to the North Node, and Nep-
tune also, in the Mid-heaven of this Chart in 27 and 21 degrees
of Pisces respectively.

Referring to the Business Cycle Chart, it is easy to see that
Pisces is the sign next to the lowest for business activity and
prices, and that the Business Curve was now “Below Normal.”

The effects of the Panic of 1857 was felt throughout 1858
with business volume from ten to six points below normal.

In February, 1859, the North Node moved into the sign of
Aquarius, which is the sign on the lowest point of the Business
Cycle Chart. This indicates that the Business Curve was at its
lowest point with prices below normal. However, a glance at the
graph depicting business volume for the period shows that
business hovered from two points above normal to two points
below sormal in activity; therefore, some strong secondary
factor must have been present which indicated that prices and
business volume were up to normal. This was the condition
present during 1859, and it was depicted by Saturn in Leo sextile
Uranus in Gemini. It was during this time that the Atlantic
submarine cable was laid.

This aspect came into force in August, 1858 and pointed to a
rise in business volume from the lows of the Panic of 1857. This
aspect was effective throughout 1859 and indicated that business
activity would reach normal.

Neptune, which is one of the planetary rulers or significators,
StAia ~ SUSINESS VOLUME of the New York Stock Exchange, was in 28 degrees Pisces,
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chast during
1860 and trine Jupiter in Cancer on the Ascendant of the Chart.
The ascendant and mid-heaven are two of the most important
angles of the Chart in relation to stock market trends and general
business activity. Since this aspect was favorable, it pointed to a
rise in business generally. The business curve rose five points

with it.
THE SECESSION DEPRESSION

Prices dropped steadily on through the fall of 1860 and
through the spring and summer of 1861 as indicated by the
culmination of a square aspect between Saturn in Virgo and
Uranus in Gemini.

On the Business Cycle Chart, the Node had moved into
Capricorn August 31, 1860, and remained in this sign through
1861, passing into Sagittarius March 19, 1862. The cycle of the
North Node from Aquarius, the Low pointyte Scorpio, the Nor-
mal point, indicated that business activity was below Normal
going to Normal, during this period and with the passing of the
secondary factors of an unfavorable nature, business would
rapidly go back to Normal.

South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860,
and the crash came which was followed by a slump in business,
a drop in commodity prices and a panic in rail issues. This finan-
cial crisis of 1860 and 1861 was the most severe crisis from a
business failure standpoint that this country has ever had, but the
depression did not last long because of the business activity
stimulated by the Civil War, and other industrial activity, which
brought higher prices.

No major planet has ever passed over the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange or in opposition to it without indicat-
ing a change in the major trend of business and stock market
Prices. This was indicated during the Secession Depression by
the passage of Neptune over the mid-heaven of the New York
Exchange Chart. During 1861 with business activity 11 points
below normal Saturn and Jupiter were in conjunction in Virgo
‘in opposition to Neptune in Pisces on the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart. These indicators pointed out
the coming slump in business and when these aspects moved
away from each other, it was an indication that business had
turned upward again. Thus it is seen that two sets of secondary
factors pointed to the business recession mentioned above. It is
significant that Railroad shares had a slump in prices when so
many prominent Rails have important planets in the sign of
Pisces. Jupiter in conjunction with Saturn in opposition to Nep-
tune square to Uranus indicated the unfavorable conditions
affecting Rail issues.

When Jupiter moved into Libra August 25, 1862, the bottom
of the Depression had been reached and slowly prices and busi-
ness activity began to improve and the Curve moved upwatd.
The North Node was in Sagittarius, which indicated on the
Business Cycle Chart that the Curve should be a little below
Normal, if there were no secondary factors present to distort
it either way. In October of 1862 both Saturn and Jupiter had
moved into Libra, a position which was just the reverse of the
preceding indications of lower prices, and it was easy to see from
these favorable indicators that business activity should revert to
Normal during 1863, especially since the North Node had moved
very near to the sign of Scorpio, which represents Normal levels
on the Business Cycle Chart.

Jupiter in Libra was trine Uranus in Gemini most of 1863 and
this good secondary factor increased prices and the Business
Curve went four points above Normal. In the late fall Mars
moved into Libra, and since Libra is a transition sign for all
planets on the Business Cycle Chart, and Mars is generally an

adverse planet when using this method of studying the Business
Curve, a slight dip in business activity took place during Decem-

ber.
WAR PROSPERITY

On October 7, 1863, the North Node moved into the sign
of Scorpio, which is the sign on the Business Cycle Chart that
indicates business activity had reached the Normal level. At the
same time Saturn was rapidly approaching a trine aspect with
Uranus, This was a strong secondary factor present which
would distort the Curve approximately 10%. On the graph
depicting business volume for the period, business activity rose
10% above Normal! This aspect lasted through April, 1864,
when the New Moon of April 6, 1864, fell in 16 degrees Aries
on the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart in
opposition to Saturn in 14 degrees Libra. This indication pointed
to a sharp drop in business activity and stock market prices during
April, which according to the graph, showed a drop of seven
points in business activity. If the good secondary factor of
Saturn trine Uranus had not still been in force, business activity
would have had a mote severe recession at this time than it did
have. This aspect kept in force indicated that prices would
still be slightly above Normal. They remained from 3 to 4
points above Normal during the remainder of 1864. Commodity
Prices were up at this time along with stock and bond prices.

PRIMARY POST WAR DEPRESSION

On January 21, 1865, the depressing planet Saturn moved into
the sign of Scorpio. This was an indication that business activity
was in for a slump, since the North Node was also in Scorpio,
the sign on the Normal angle of the Business Cycle Chart. As
this aspect became exact lasting through October of the same year,
the crash came and business volume tumbled 14 points below
Normal under this strong secondary aspect. Jupiter was also in
Opposition to Uranus during this period adding weight to the
above testimony. These indications pointed clearly to the sharp
reaction during the year.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

As the North Node moved into the sign of Libra on April
28, 1865, Saturn had also moved back into the sign of Libra
holding the aspect in force until late fall. The North Node’s
transit into Libra indicated that the Business volume Curve was
now going from Normal to Above Normal, and that if no un-
favorable secondary factors wete present to keep the Curve dowa-
ward, business activity should be slightly Above Normal for this
period.

On September 30, 1865, Saturn moved into Scorpio again, this
time forming a trine aspect with Uranus in Cancer. Prices and
business turned sharply upward with business volume rising 14
points to Normal by the end of February, 1866. This tise in the
Business Curve continued through September, 1866, with the
favorable aspect indicating that business volume would go 10%
above normal, which it did.

As it has been stated before in this astronomic theory of fore-
casting business and stock market trends, as long as a major planet
is passing over the mid-heaven of the New York Exchange Chart,
this planet is the “key” for studying business indications for the
future for as long as the planet transits the mid-heaven. Monthly
trends in the Stock Market can be easily determined by watching
the lunations each twenty-eight days. If the lunation falls con-
junction, square, or in opposition to the planet passing over the
mid-heaven, watch out, for the Stock Market will then react
according to the indications at the lunation, when the Moon
Passes over that important point, during the forthcoming month.

This theory of forecasting business trends and stock market
action explains clearly why so many Stock Market crashes and
slumps have come in April and October rather than in other
months of the year. The Sun transits the sign of Aries every
year from March 21 to April 20th, and this is the sign which is
co-ruler with Pisces of the mid-heaven of the Chart of the New
York Stock Exchange. The Sun transits the sign of Libra every
year from September 23rd to October 23rd, and this is the sign
which is in exact opposition to Aries. Whenever there is a
major planet passing through Aries and the lunation falls con-

[22]

 

 

 
      
 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

junction (as in April) or in opposition to it (as in September
and October) then the Market slumps come.

England is ruled by the sign Aries, and it is significant that
the transits of major planets through this sign or in opposition
to it, affect its business conditions and point out the rise and fall
of its stock prices very clearly. The tie-up between the London
Exchange and Wall Street is shown by the rulership of Aries on
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart. Slumps
in London have a sympathetic recession here and vice versa.

To return to 1866, history records a financial panic in London
in the spring of that year. Neptune was in 11 degrees Aries in
October of 1866. The lunation for October, 1866, fell in 14
degrees Libra in opposition to Neptune on the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart in square aspect to Uranus in
Cancer and in exact square to the ascendant of the same chart in
14 degrees Cancer. This lunation indicated a slump in business
and stock prices which took the Curve downward ten points by
the end of the year. The latter part of December, 1866, saw a
minor unfavorable aspect between Saturn in 20 degrees Scorpio
and Uranus in 7 degrees Cancer. This was the sesquiquadrate
aspect of 135 degrees. Although not very important usually, it
was strong enough to help keep business activity four points below
normal accentuating the unfavorable aspect, Neptune square
Uranus and the ascendant, of the Stock Market Chart. This
influence lasted through February, 1867, and was accompanied
by a dtop in commodity prices and a decided recession in rail
stock prices.

On November 13, 1866, the North Node moved into the
sign of Virgo and the natural position of the Business Curve
should be slightly above Normal and the trend of business from
“Normal to High.” (The High point being reached as the
North Node transits Leo in 1868 and 1869.)

The North Node remained in Virgo throughout 1867. The
secondary factor, Saturn sesquiquadrate Uranus, was effective
through February, 1867. Then prices rose along with improved
business activity through the spring and summer to three points

£23]


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

above Normal due to the slight aspect, though not close enough
to bring a big rise in business activity, of Satur trine Uranus.
After August of this year, the Curve turned downward to four
points below Normal through February, 1868, as the sesqui-
quadrate aspect came into force again. After February, 1868,
Business volume increased and by August, 1868, the Business
Carve had risen four points above Normal or a rise of six points
on the graph in five months time. This was due to the fact that
Saturn had moved into Sagittarius and too far away from Uranus
for an aspect to be effective. This indicated that a change in trend
was coming and that it would be upward with the removal of
the secondary factors distorting the Curve at that time. The Busi-
ness Curve confirms this indication. It stayed three to four
points above Normal through the remainder of the year. This
influence carried the Curve upward through June, 1869, to five
points above Normal. By this time Uranus had reached 17 de-
grees Cancer, the Ascendant of the New York Stock Exchange
chart and was in square to Neptune in 19 degrees Aries on the
mid-heaven of this same chart. Prices slowly turned down with
the Business Curve through the summer as Jupiter was in exact
square to the North Node.

On September 6, 1869, the lunation occurred in 13 degrees
Virgo in quincunx aspect to Neptune on the mid-heaven (of
the New York Exchange Chart) and this unfavorable aspect of
exactly 150 degrees indicated the short-lived Panic of 1869,
which occurred on September 24, 1869. This Panic was mostly
a Wall Street affair. Stocks had advanced to high levels from
the long period of speculation since the War and a reaction set
in. Money sates were at their highest level since 1857 and 1860.
Since this Panic occurred on Friday, this slump has gone down
in financial history as the “Black Friday Panic.”

With the passing of the temporary unfavorable aspect, the
Curve began to rise and by June, 1870, had climbed to four points
above Normal. In May of 14870, Jupiter moved into Gemini,
which is the sign ruling the United States. This is a very favor-
able secondary factor and prices should have jumped sharply up

[24]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

and carried the Business Curve with it, if there had not been an
unfavorable secondary factor present. The North Node had
moved into Cancer the 22nd of December, 1869, and by June had
reached a conjunction aspect with the revolutionary and disturb-
ing planet Uranus. This aspect caused the Business Curve to
drop five points below normal. By October, 1870, the influence
of this unfavorable secondary factor had waned. Uranus was io
26 degrees Cancer and the North Node was in 14 degrees Can-
cer. (Conjunction aspects ave not effective outside of an orb
of 10 degrees). This fact should be kept in mind for in this
theory of determining the Business and Stock Market trend,
aspects coming into a ten degree range point to changes in trend
many months in advance.

INDUSTRIAL OVER-EXPANSION
PROSPERITY PERIOD

The Business Curve turned sharply upward after October, 1870
and by April, 1871, was standing at six points above normal.
This was the beginning of the three year period known in finan-
cial history as the “Industrial Over-Expansion Prosperity Period.”
Jupiter was in Gemini, the sign ruling the United States, in
favorable aspect (sextile 60 degrees) to Neptune in Aries on the
mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange chart and to
Uranus in Cancer on the ascendant of this same chart.

During this period business activity was greatly above normal.
Railroads were expanding and being built everywhere. Most
Rail stocks come under the influence of the Fire Signs, Aries, Leo,
and Sagittarius. Neptune was in Aries at this time in very favor-
able aspect (érine 120 degrees) to Saturn in Sagittarius and to
Jupiter in Gemini (60 degrees-sextile). Rail stocks experienced
peak prices under these influences.

In May, 1871, Jupiter moved into Cancer and in July of the
same yeat, the North Node moved into Gemini. These were
favorable indications of a booming business period. Both Gemini
and Cancer are the ruling signs of the United States. Whenever

beneficent planets or the North Node transits these signs there is
always improved business activity, unless some very strong un-
favorable secondary factor is present to hold the Curve downward.

The Business Volume Curve stood at six points above normal
from April through November of 1871. In December, the Curve
turned upward again rising sharply through January, Februaty,
and March of 1872. This upturn was pointed out by the fact that
Jupiter was in conjunction with Uranus in Cancer, a strong
secondary factor which indicated bullish prices, and lifted the
Business Curve to 11 points above normal.

In April, 1872, Neptune was still on the mid-heaven of the
New York Stack Exchange Chart in 23 degrees Aries; Uranus 27
degrees Cancer was in conjunction with Jupiter in 22 degrees
Cancer and Saturn was in 21 degrees Capricorn, This was an un-
usual planetary arrangement with four major planets all placed
on angles of the New York Stock Exchange Chart and in square
aspect and in opposition to each other. If the primary Curve of
Business had not been above normal during this period, aug-
mented by a strong secondary factor of Jupiter conjunction
Uranus in Cancer, this combination of aspects would have pointed
to a slump in business. As it was, however, the North Node
was in Gemini, a very favorable factor, which pointed to an
above normal position for the Business Curve and in con-
sequence only a slight recession took place while these aspects
lasted.

The Iunation of April 8, 1872, occurred in 18 degrees Aries
conjunction Mars and Neptune in Aries, the two planetary rulers
of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart. This
lunation indicated the slight recession which caused the Business
Curve to drop three points, This recession lasted until the last of
June when Uranus and Jupiter both moved into Leo. This placed
both planets in favorable aspect (60 degrees-sextile) to the North
Node in Gemini. This caused the Business Curve to turn upward
with boom proportions. Jupiter in conjunction with Uranus
doubled the influence of the favorable secondary factor, Jupiter
sextile the Node, and the Curve turned sharply upward through

the remainder of 1872. The Business Curve reached the top of
this boom in January, 1873, when it stood at 15 points above
normal.

On January 28, 1873, the North Node moved into Taurus, one
of the transition points on the Business Cycle Chart and this was
a definite indication that the trend had turned downward for a
period of six years or the time it took for the Nosth Node to
pass through the signs Taurus, Aries, Pisces, and Aquarius, the
last being the sign on the low point of the Business Cycle Chast.
{See Chart)

From June 4, 1868, to January 28, 1873, the North Node had
passed through Leo, (the top point of the Business Cycle Chart),
Cancer and Gemini. The Business Curve was above normal dur-
ing this period with the trend slowly approaching normal. When
the Normal point was reached, as the North Node moved into
Taurus, the cycle had definitely changed. The Curve had now
swung downward. This was the beginning of a period in finan-
cial history known as the “Secondary Post-War Depression”
which lasted for a period of six years.

THE SECONDARY POST-WAR DEPRESSION
PERIOD

On March 14, 1873, Saturn moved into the sign of Aquarius
forming a very unfavorable aspect (opposition 180 degrees) with
Uranus in 2 degrees Leo. This secondary factor indicated that this
country was due for a financial depression of large proportions; a
fact which was indicated six months in advance of the actual
crash on September 18, 1873, following the failures of the then
well-known firms of Kenyon, Cox and Co., the New York Ware-
house and Security Co. and Jay Cook and Co. This was one of
the worst panics since the War Between the States as it was both
a commercial and a Stock Exchange panic. On September 20,
1873, the New York Stock Exchange closed its doors for the
first time in history and remained closed for ten days.

Was the crash of September 18, 1873, predictable in advance?
Yes, by this theory of forecasting the Stock Market, it was.

Monthly trend changes are pointed out at the lunation which
occurs each month at an interval of twenty-eight days. The luna-
tion is the conjunction of the Sun and Moon or the “New Moon”
each month. September 18, 1873, occurred three days before the
lunation for September; therefore, the crash of September 18,
1873, was shown in the preceding lunation for August, which fell
on August 22, 1873, in 29 degrees Leo in square aspect (90 de-
grees) to Mars, (one of the planetary rulers of the mid-beaven
of the New York Stock Exchange Chart) and in square aspect to
Pluto and the North Node which were also in conjunction with
each other. Any planet in conjunction with the North Node has
a marked effect on business activity and Stock Market trends
and if it is present it is a secondary factor that must always be
taken into account when analyzing business conditions or the
Stock Market averages.

The presence of this secondary factor, Pluto in conjunction
with the North Node, indicated a decided change coming in the
trend of business and Stock Market prices. Taurus is one of the
signs of transition on the Business Cycle Chart and since it is the
sign showing the trend from “Normal” to “Below Normal” busi-
ness, this aspect corroborated other testimony that the country was
on the verge of a financial crisis accompanied by a slump on the
New York Stock Exchange. The crash, however, did not come
until the Moon passed over 29 degrees Leo which occurred on
September 18, 1873. The Business Curve dropped during the
year from a high in March of 15 points above normal to five
points below normal.

The Business Curve continued to move downward all during
1874 and 1875, until at the end of 1875 business activity was
standing at 15 points below normal. During the first half of
1874, Uranus and Saturn were in opposition to each other and
in square aspect (90 degrees) to the North Node and Neptune,
one of the rulets of the New York Stock Exchange Chart.

On August 16, 1874, the North Node moved into the sign
of Aries and the economic curve was downward in trend until the
“Below Normai” point was reached on September 22, 1877, when

[30}

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

the North Node moved into Aquarius, which is the sign on the
low point of the Business Cycle Chart.

Rail stocks were at a low ebb during 1874. Cotton and wheat
prices also were depressed and a record number of failures took
place. During October, November and December of 1874, the
North Node was in conjunction with Neptune, an unfavorable
secondary factor which was manifested in a two point drop of
the Business Curve which was carried through 1875.

In the fall of 1875 the Business Activity Curve turned down-
watd six points as Mars and Jupiter formed unfavorable aspects
to the unfavorable secondary factor (Saturn in Aquarius in oppo-
sition to Uranus in Leo), already in existence. Mars was in con-
junction with Saturn opposition Uranus, and Jupiter was square
aspect to all three planets.

The depression carried through 1876 and 1877, as the North
Node entered Aquarius, the low point on the Business Cycle
Chart. The North Node in Aquarius was in opposition to Uranus
in Leo and this secondary unfavorable factor caused the Business
Curve to drop around 31/, points bringing business activity to
13 points below normal through January and Februaty, 1878,
while the aspect was in effect.

In the spring of 1878, the Business Curve moved upward four
points as the unfavorable secondary factors disappeared. In the
fall of 1878, the favorable secondary factor, Jupiter in Aquarius
in conjunction with the North Node, lifted the curve another
point and one-half which brought the curve between 7 and 8
points below normal by the end of the year.

During January, February and March, 1879 the Business
Curve receded four points as Neptune in Taurus was square the
Node in Aquarius. This brought business activity down to
11 points below normal.

On April 13, 1879, the North Node passed out of Aquarius
into the sign of Capricorm which indicated that the Business
Cycle was now in a slow uptrend swing from “Below Normal”
to “Normal” as is shown on the Business Cycle Chart. The
normal or transition point wes reached when the North Node

[31]

 

 


 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

passed into the sign of Scorpio, three years later, on May 19,
1882.

When the North Node moved into Capricorn in April, 1879,
it formed a very favorable aspect (rine 120 degrees) with the
powerful planet Pluto. The presence of this strong secondary
factor indicated a sharp upturn in business activity and this
factor carried the Business Curve from 11 points below normal
to normal by August of the same year. This uptum in business
was the beginning of a three year boom, known in financial
history as the “Gold Resumption Prosperity Period.”

THE GOLD RESUMPTION PROSPERITY

PERIOD 1879-1883

Although the influence of the powerful secondary factor, Pluto
trine the North Node, diminished in October, 1879, three other
favorable secondary factors were present, Uranus, Neptune and
Mars trine (120 degrees) the North Node with Mars and Nep-
tune in conjunction with each other and in favorable aspect to
Uranus. The Business Curve, as a result of this concentrative
power, continued to rise through the fali of 1879 and by Decem-
ber stood at nine points above normal. This was 2 20 point rise
in business activity in nine months.

The Business Curve rose two points through January and
February, 1880. In March, 1880, an unfavorable secondary
factor, Satum square (90 degrees) the North Node, came into
effect. The Business Curve dropped six points through Septem-
ber, 1880. Saturn was also in sesqui-quadrate aspect to Uranus
during these five months. This combination of unfavorable sec-
ondary factors would have caused a greater drop in business
activity had not Uranus also been in trine aspect (120 degrees)
to the North Node which was a very favorable secondary factor
present that kept business volume above normal.

Stock and grain prices went lower under the slightly unfavor-
able aspect Saturn sesqui-quadrate Uranus. Saturn passed through
Aries from May, 1878 to April, 1881. In this sign position, it
passed over the mid-heaven of the chart of the New York Stock

Exchange and during this petiod affected the major trend of the
Stock Market by keeping stock prices lower than they ordinarily
would have been during this two and one-half year period.

On October 31, 1880, the North Node moved into Sagittarius
forming a favorable trine aspect (120 degrees) with Saturn,
which in itself was in semi-sextile aspect (30 degrees) to the
powerful planet Pluto. This combination of favorable secondary
factors sent the Business Curve upward seven points through the
fall and January, 1881, at which time the Business Curve was
standing at 12 points above normal. There was a decline of three
points from this business prosperity high through May, 1881.

In April, 1881, both Saturn and Jupiter, which were in con-
junction in Aries, moved into the sign of Taurus where they were
still in conjunction with each other, besides being in orb of an
approaching conjunction aspect with Neptune, also in Taurus,
and in orb of a trine aspect (120 degrees) with Uranus. This
was an unusual configuration of planets since five major planets
were in earthy or materialistic signs. They were Jupiter, Saturn,
Neptune and Pluto in Taurus and Uranus in Virgo.

Through history and research it bas been found that when
several major planets are in earth signs at the same time, that
men’s minds turn toward the getting of material things in life
and, therefore, business activity and volume increases.

Business activity stayed around 11 points above normal
throughout the year of 1881. There was a two point drop in
the summer and fall as Uranus was in square aspect (90 degrees)
to the North Node. This unfavorable secondary factor would
have pointed out more of a drop in the Business Curve, if four
major planets had not been in favorable aspect to each other,
while all four planets were in earth signs—three of these planets,
Neptune, Saturn and Jupiter being in the financial sign of
Taurus.

During January and February, 1882, the Business Curve recov-
ered its two point loss and the top of this rise was 11 points
above normal where the Business Curve remained through March

and part of April.

{34]

   

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

On April 22, 1882, the expansive planet Jupiter moved into
the sign of Gemini, the sign which has part ulership over the
United States, together with the sign of Cancer. At the same time
Jupiter formed a square (90 degree) aspect with the North Node.
This caused the curve to turn downward slightly. On May 19,
1882, the North Node moved into Scorpio, the sign on the
normal point of the Business Cycle Chart. As Saturn was still
in Taurus, it formed at this time an opposition (180 degree)
aspect with the North Node which lasted through August, 1882.
This unfavorable secondary factor caused the Business Curve to
drop six points.

Through the fall the Business Curve turned upward and te-
gained four points of its loss by December. In January, 1883, the
Business Curve turned downward and marked the beginning of
the long, and slow depression from 1883 to 1886 which has
come to be known in history as the “Depression of 1884.”

THE DEPRESSION OF 1884

When the North Node moved into Scorpio, May 19, 1882, the
Business Cycle Chart indicated that business conditions were
passing through a transition period which would last until June
22, 1885, corresponding with the time taken for the passage of
the North Node through the signs of Scorpio and Libra, transi-
tion signs on the Business Cycle Chart. The normal trend of
business volume following this transition period was from “nor-
mal to high” if no unfavorable secondary factors were present
to distort the Curve below the normal or transition point. Dur-
ing the Depression of 1884, business volume decreased to 13
points below normal; therefore, one or more unfavorable secon-
dary factors must have been present during this period.

Satur and Neptune in conjunction in Taurus wete moving in
opposition (180 degrees) to the North Node in Scorpio in
December, 1882, and Januaty, 1883, and these factors precipi-
tated the drop in the Curve which went from nine points above
normal to three points above normal by the end of August.

On May 24, 1883, the price depressing planet Saturn moved

{35}

y8sl AO NOISSdade#a

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

into the sign of Gemini which governs the United States. This
unfavorable secondary factor always affects business conditions
adversely when it transits the signs ruling the United States.

Saturn has passed through the sign of Gemini three times
since 1850 and each time the United States has suffered under-
depressed business conditions and hard times. The Business Curve
moved downward during the summer and fall of 1883 under
this influence. By December the Curve was standing at four
points below normal.

On December 7, 1883, the North Node moved into Libra. The
Business Cycle Chart indicates that the normal position of the
business activity Curve should be slightly above normal due to
the fact the sign of Libra is slightly above Scorpio, ,which is the
sign representing the normal point in this system of forecasting
the trend of business. Favorable and unfavorable secondary fac-
tors, it has been found, can distort the curve from its logical and
correct position by as much as 20% depending on the strength
of the secondary factor or combination of factors involved.
Saturn required two and one-half years to transit a sign and its
passage through Gemini should correspond with a two and one-
half year period of depressed business conditions for this coun-
try. This is the case as can readily be seen by reference to the
diagram of this depression.

Rail and Industrial stocks declined in price during all of 1884.
Another unfavorable secondary factor came into play during the
summer when Saturn in Gemini formed a square aspect (90
degrees) with Uranus in Virgo, The effects of this aspect were
felt through the spring of 1886.

On April 30, 1884, J. R. Keene failed. This started the crash.
The lunation of April 25, 1884, fell in 5 degrees Taurus in square
aspect (90 degrees) to Mars, one of the rulers of the mid-heaven
of the Chart of the New York Stock Exchange. Mars was in 11
degrees Leo. When the Sun had moved to 10 degrees Taurus
on April 30, which made the aspect less than a degree from being
exact, and the Moon was in Cancer passing over the ascendant of
the Exchange Chart, the panic started.

[37]

 

 

 

 

 


    
      

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

On May 6, 1884, Grant and Ward, as weil as Marine National
Bank, failed. At this time the Sun was in 15 degrees Taurus in
exact square aspect (90 degrees) to Mars in 15 degrees Leo with
the Moon in Libra, the sign on the lowest point of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart. A money panic occurred on May
12th and 13th, followed on the 14th by the issuance of Clearing
House Certificates. Fisk and Hatch and the Metropolitan Bank
of New York failed May 15, 1884. On May 12th and 13th—
the days of the money panic—the Sun was in conjunction with
Neptune, the other ruler of the mid-heaven of the Exchange
Chart, and the Sun and Neptune were in square aspect to Mars,
while Mars and N e the two tulers of the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart were in square aspect to each
other while the Moon was in opposition aspect (180 degrees) to
Saturn in Gemini. This series of unfavorable secondary factors
clearly indicated the financial trouble of this period.

It is a noticeable fact that the Moon is usually in one of the
angles of the New York Stock Exchange Chart when a panic
or slump occurs. If the lunation indicates a change in the trend
of the Stock Market for the following month, watch carefully
for the days when the Moon passes through Aries, Cancer, Libra
and Capricorn. The drop usually will occur on one of these days.

During the summer and fall of 1884, the unfavorable secon-
dary factory, Saturn in Gemini square Uranus in Virgo, was so
close that business volume shrank leaving the Business Curve
standing at 13 points below normal by January of 1885. The
force of this unfavorable aspect was felt throughout the spring
and summer of 1885.

On June 25, 1885, the North Node moved into the sign of
Virgo, indicating that the natural position of the Business Curve
should be above normal, if it were not distorted by an unfavor-
able secondary factor. The influence of the Saturn-Uranus square
aspect began to lessen during November and December, 1885,
and by the end of the year the Business Curve had moved upward
six points.

The Business Curve continued its climb through the spring of

{38}

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

1886 and by June had moved to four points above normal. This
was a nine point rise in business activity in six months. This
rise continued throughout the year and reached 11 points above
normal by March, 1887.

On Januaty 13, 1887, the North Node moved into Leo, the
sign on the high point of the Business Cycle Chart where it
remained through July 30, 1888. This indicated that business
volume and activity should be at a high level, at least 10 to 15
points above normal, if there were no unfavorable secondary
factors present to distort the Curve. However, Saturn and
Uranus were within eight degrees of each other and moved
closer through July, 1887. The Business Curve correspondingly
dropped from eleven to two points above normal during this

ciod.

Peon August 19, 1887, Saturn moved into Leo, and for three
months was within slight orb of a very favorable or trine (120
degrees) aspect with Uranus. The Business Curve rose six points,
dropping in December as Saturn and Uranus moved out of orb.
At the same time the depressing planet Saturn moved within orb
of a conjunction with the North Node, which governs business
conditions. This immediately turned the Business Curve down-
ward through July, 1888. There was a drop in business volume
from seven points above normal to two points below normal or
the Business Curve turned downward nine points altogether.

THE RAILROAD PROSPERITY PERIOD
1888-1892

The Nosth Node moved from Leo to the sign of Cancer on
August 1, 1888. The Business Curve was now starting slowly
downward toward the normal point which it reached in Septem-
ber, 1891. In the interim the North Node passed through
Cancer and Gemini, two signs closely related to the affairs of
the United States, During the fall of 1888, the Curve rose to six
points above normal as Saturn in Leo and Uranus in Libra were
in favorable sextile (60 degrees) aspect to each other. In Jan-
vary, 1889, Uranus turned retrograde, that is, started moving

backward in its orbit. At the same time it formed an exact square
aspect (90 degrees) with the North Node, which was unfavor-
able. This caused the Business Curve to drop five points through
June of 1889, at which time Uranus turned direct in its motion
and started moving away from the North Node as the Business
Curve stood at only one point above normal.

The Curve moved up sharply through the summer and fall of
1889 as Saturn in Leo was in close sextile (60 degrees) aspect
with Uranus in Libra. The powerful planet Pluto was in con-
junction with Neptune, one of the New York Stock Exchange
planetary rulers.

Saturn moved into the sign of Virgo October 7, 1889, forming
a favorable sextile aspect (60 degrees) with the North Node
through December. At the end of the year the Business Curve
stood at nine points above normal.

The year 1890 opened with business activity well above nor-
mal. The Business Curve from January to May moved from nine
points above norma! to 14 points above normal, a total rise of
five points in five months.

On February 19, 1890, the North Node moved into Gemini,
which (together with Cancer) rules the United States. This move
brought the North Node within orb of a favorable trine aspect
with Uranus in Libra. Saturn moved back into Leo on February
25th. This brought into effect a strong favorable relationship
between Saturn, Uranus and the North Node. Uranus was trine
the North Node and Saturn was sextile the North Node, while
being in favorable aspect to each other. The Business Curve,
therefore, stood at 13 points above normal in May. It would have
been only slightly above normal in its natural position without
the presence of the favorable secondary factors which pushed the
curve upward,

From June through August of 1890, the Business Curve
dropped four points due to the fact that Saturn moved into the
sign of Virgo where it came in orb of an unfavorable square
aspect with Neptune and Pluto in conjunction in Gemini. This
strong unfavorable secondary factor would have forced the Busi-

[41]

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

ness Curve lower if Uranus had not been in favorable trine aspect

(120 degrees) to the North Node at the same time, Through |
and October, the Business Curve climbed back two }
points when Saturn moved out of orb of the square aspect with

Neptune and Pluto.

In November, 1890, Saturn formed an unfavorable aspect with

the North Node. This unfavorable factor pointed out the busi-
ness crisis which Jasted through June, 1891, and which is known
in financial history as the “Baring Crisis.” This crisis was pre-
cipitated in England by the failure of Baring Brothers. The Busi-
ness Curve dropped from 12 points above normal to seven points
below normal—a total drop of 19 points in six months.

BARING CRISIS—1891

Stock prices declined sharply during this period and com-
modity prices were the lowest since the War between the States.

In May, 1891, the Business Curve moved sharply upward as the
North Node and Saturn moved out of otb of the unfavorable
square aspect between them.

From January to the end of June, 1891, Saturn in Virgo
formed a slightly unfavorable aspect with Uranus. This semi-
square aspect (45 degrees) added weight to the unfavorable as-
pect between Saturn and the North Node in force at the time of
the Baring Crisis.

Since the powerful planet Pluto was in conjunction with Nep-
tune, co-ruler of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Ex-
change, and the North Node, the Business Curve turned sharply
upward in May and reached 13 points above normal, a level which
it maintained through October. A drop of two points in the
Business Curve occurred in November due to the fact that the
North Node no longer was in conjunction with Pluto and Nep-
tune.

The North Node moved into Taurus on September 10, 1891.
Since Taurus is the sign on the normal or transition point of the
Business Cycle Chart, the movement of the North Node into

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

Taurus indicated a change in the Business Curve for several years
to come, The primary or major cycle of business was in a transi-
tion period lasting until March 28, 1893, when the North Node
moved into Aries indicating that the trend of the Business Curve
was moving from normal to low and that the business cycle was
moving downward for four years until the North Node moved out
of the sign of Aquarius on November 22, 1897. Aquarius is the
low point on the Business Cycle Chart and the Business Curve
did not start upward until after that point had been reached. The
North Node passed through Aquarius from May 4, 1896, to No-
vember 22, 1897.

On October 22, 1891, the fiery planet Mars moved into the
sign of Libra where it remained through December 7th of the
same year, Libra is the sign on the fourth or lowest angle of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart and also a transition sign on
the Business Cycle Chart; therefore, it is particularly sensitive to
planetary transits. Mars usually depresses the Curve slightly as it
passes through Libra; in this case the Curve dropped two points.

The Curve turned upward thtee points through December, |

1891, and January, 1892, reaching a high in February of 14 points
above normal,

From March until August, 1892, Saturn in Virgo moved in
opposition aspect to the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Ex-
change in 28 degrees Pisces. This caused an 11 point drop in
the Business Curve during this period, which marked the end of
the Railroad Prosperity Period.

There was a recovery of five points through the fall of 1892

from the low point of August which had carried business activity |

to two points above normal. In December the Business Curve

stood at eight points above normal. This was due to the slightly |

favorable semi-sextile aspect (30 degrees) between Saturn in
Libra and Uranus in Scorpio. Stock Market prices rose under this

favorable influence. Business activity dropped one point during |

January and February of 1893, but the Business Curve rose three
points through April, reaching a high of 10 poiots above normal,
which was the top level reached before the Panic of 1893.

[4]

   

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

THE PANIC OF 1893-1895

This financial crisis in the United States was precipitated in
May by the failure of the Chemica! National Bank of Chicago and
others, including The National Cordage Company. The Business
Curve plummeted from 10 points above normal to 20 points be-
low normal. This was a drop of 30 points in business activity
from May to August of 1893. Stocks dropped sharply in value,
especially Industrials which were off as much as 30 points in the
Industrial Averages.

The sharp and irregular depression of 1893 came at a time
when prices were the lowest they had ever been in the economic
history of this country. Crop failures both in 1893 and 1894 were
numerous.

The North Node was in 28 degrees Aries and moving back-
ward over the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange dur-
ing May, 1893. Pluto and Neptune were in conjunction in Ge-
mini, the sign which is co-significator of the United States, and
together they were forming an unfavorable semi-square aspect
(45 degrees) to the North Node. These secondary factors in-
dicated the financial crisis affecting this country during this period.
The Business Cycle Curve had started downward and the un-
favorable secondary factors present depressed the curve 20%.
(All secondary factors, favorable or unfavorable, have the power
to inflate or deflate the normal trend of the Business Curve from
1 fo 20% depending upon the strength of the secondary factor
involved.)

Any planet (or the Nodes which in this method of forecasting
have the strength of planets and are considered as such) which
passes over the mid-heaven or 10th angle of the New York Stock
Exchange Chart always indicates in advance a coming definite
change in trend of Stock Market prices; and if the planet is un-
favorable, it indicates a financial panic or business crisis. These
warning signals are always given months in advance. Any trader
buying and selling on these signals is the master of economic law
instead of its victim.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

From September, 1893 to April, 1894, the Business Curve rose
from 20 points below normal to 14 points below normal. This
was a total of six points rise as the unfavorable semi-square aspect
(45 degrees} between the North Node in Aries and Pluto and
Neptune in Gemini moved into a favorable sextile (60 degrees)
angle. In April, 1894, the Business Curve dropped to 20 points
below normal. Saturn at this time was in 22 degrees Libra in
opposition aspect (180 degrees) to the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart. The funation for April, 1894, fell
in 16 degrees Aries in the mid-heaven of the Chart in opposition
(180 degrees) to Saturn. This unfavorable secondary influence
caused stock prices to drop sharply.

In May, 1894, the funation fell in 14 degrees Taurus in opposi-
tion (180 degrees) aspect to Uranus. The adverse affect of this
funation kept the Business Curve down through May.

On June 3, £894, the Iunation fell in 12 degrees Gemini in
conjunction with Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter and in square aspect
(90 degrees) with Mars, the co-ruler of the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart. This unfavorable aspect of
Mars kept stock prices down as well as general business condi-
tions; however, recovery factors were at work and when the tem-
porary effects of this lunation (28 days) were over the Business
Curve took a sharp tur upward. This was due to the presence of
the expansive planet Jupiter in conjunction with the powerful
planets Pluto and Neptune in the sign of Gemini, which strongly
influences the United States. Stocks and bonds rose under these
favorable secondary factors and Industrial Averages had approxi-
mately a 20 point rise in a year’s time.

From July through December, 1894, the Business Curve rose
sharply to five points below normal. This was a 15% increase in
business activity during this period and preceded the period
known in history as “The Recovery of 1895.”

THE RECOVERY OF 1895
On October 16, 1894, the North Node moved into Pisces and
reference to the Business Cycle Chart shows that the normal trend

of the Curve was slowly moving lower. The powerful secondary
factor, Pluto in conjunction with Neptune in the sign of Gemini,
which rules the United States moved the Business Curve upward
to nearly four points below normat. Jupiter was also in Cancer
during the fali (Cancer is the other sign of the Zodiac which
with Gemini rules the United States), and Jupiter in this position
aids rising prices.

In Januaty, 1895, the Business Curve dropped five points due
to the fact that Jupiter moved back into the sign of Gemini and
formed an unfavorable square aspect (90 degrees) with the North
Node. This aspect held the Business Curve down through April
when Jupiter moved out of Gemini and into Cancer again.

In April, 1895, the Business Curve started upward on a 15
point rise which reached six points above nocmal by September as
Uranus was in a favorable trine aspect (120 degrees) to the
North Node. The North Node came into an unfavorable square
(90 degrees) aspect with Pluto and N e in September and
these unfavorable secondary factors stopped the rise and caused
the Business Curve to drop slightly through the fall. In the
meantime the price-depressing planet Saturn moved to an un-
favorable conjunction aspect with the powerful governmental
planet Uranus. This aspect became close enough to become effec-
tive in January and February, 1896, which marked the beginning
of the “Silver Campaign Depression.”

THE SILVER CAMPAIGN DEPRESSION
1896-1897

Saturn and Uranus were in conjunction aspect during this en-
tire depression. The nomination of William Jennings Bryan,
Democrat, and the free silver campaign, did much toward bring- if
ing about this panic, as there was fear that the gold standard
would be abolished. It is significant that Jupiter (ruler of the
Nation’s finances}, was in Leo (the sign ruling Gold), during
1896. This planetary position alone indicated an adherence to
the gold standard which resulted in the defeat of Bryan and the
election of McKinley.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

Rails suffered a drastic decline in this depression while Indus-
trial averages reached the lowest point since the War between
the States. Also during this year (1896) crops were poor and
commodity prices stood at the lowest point since 1869.

On May 4, 1896, the North Node moved into Aquarius, the
sign on the “Low” angle of the Business Cycle Chart where it
remained until November 22, 1897. The passage of the North
Node through Aquarius marked the end of the downward trend
of the Business Curve and the Business Cycle began slowly to
swing upward from the Low Point to Normal.

When the North Node moved into Aquarius it slowly ap-
proached an unfavorable square aspect (90 degrees) with Uranus
and Saturn in conjunction in Scorpio. This unfavorable secondary
factor combined with Uranus’ and Saturn's unfavorable influence,
depressed the Curve 18 points. Jupiter in Leo was also in an
unfavorable squate aspect (90 degrees) to Uranus and Saturn;
and in unfavorable opposition aspect (180 degrees) to the North
Node.

Jupiter moved out of Leo into Virgo September 28, 1896, and
this transit lifted the Curve slightly from the low point of August
and September when stock prices and business activity reached
their lowest level since the War between the States.

Neptune and the powerful planet Pluto in Gemini, although
7 degrees apart, were in otb of a conjunction aspect and this
powerful secondary factor, in the sign which co-rules the United
States, lifted the Business Curve 6 points by January, 1897.

During January and February of 1897, the Business Curve
rose two more points where it stood at 10 points below normal.
In March, 1897, however, the Curve dropped back to 12 points
below normal as Saturn turned Retrograde in motion which was a
retarding influence on the Curve.

In April and May, 1897, the North Node formed a favorable
trine aspect (120 degrees) with the powerful planet Pluto. This
aspect lifted the Business Curve slightly which became a sharp
upturn in August when the expansive planct Jupiter moved in
sextile aspect (60 degrees) to Saturn and Uranus in conjunction

[51]

 


 

 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

in Scorpio. This combination of secondary factors exerted a fa-
vorable influence which caused the Curve to rise six points in
August and by the end of October the Curve stood at two points
below the normal line.

On November 22, 1897, the North Node passed out of Aqua-
tius, the sign on the'low point of the Business Cycle Chart, into
the sign of Capricorn. The Business Curve was now on 2 slow
long swing upward from low to normal business activity. As the
Node moved into Capricorn it formed a favorable sixty degree
angle with Uranus in Scorpio and this favorable secondary factor
took the Business Curve three points above normal through Feb-
rary, 1898. Jupiter was also in conjunction with the North Node
during January and February, 1898.

During ali of 1898 the Business Curve remained close to the
normal line. In May the Curve was 1 point below normal; in
June, 1 point above normal; in July, 2 points below normal; in
October, 1 point below normal; and in December, 1 point above
normal. Although the normal position of the Business Curve
was below normal, the fact that Jupiter was in a favorable sixty
degree angle (sextile aspect) with both Saturn and Uranus, this
secondary factor lifted the Curve to the normal point during
1898.

During 1899 the Business Curve rose steadily from 1 point
above normal to 11 points above normal at the end of the year.
This was due to the favorable aspect between Jupiter and Uranus
to the North Node. Jupiter and Uranus were in a 30 degree angle
(semi-sextile aspect) to each other, while Uranus was in sem-
sextile (30 degrees) aspect to the North Node and Jupiter was
in a favorable sextile aspect (60 degrees) to the North Node.
These aspects lasted through June when the North Node moved
out of Capricorn into Sagittarius on June 10, 1899.

The passage of the North Node into Sagittarius took the nat-
ural position of the Business Curve to nearly normal. The strong
secondary factors present pushed the Curve above normal during
the year.

When the North Node moved into Sagittarius, it was within

[52]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

10 degrees of 2 conjunction aspect with the depressing planet
Saturn. This aspect usually depresses the Business Curve tem-
porarily, but Jupiter in a favorable 30 degree angle to both Saturn
and the Node at this time sent the Curve upward instead, through
January and February, 1900. This shatp upward trend in the
latter part of 1899 was the forerunner of the three year period of
above-normal prices known in history as the “Merger Prosperity
Period.”
THE MERGER PROSPERITY PERIOD
1900-1903

Business activity started strong at the beginning of 1900, but
soon slumped well below the normal line. This was due to the
fact that the North Node came into an unfavorable 180 degree
angle (opposition aspect) with the powerful planet Pluto. Uranus
and Jupiter in conjunction in Sagittarius were also forming 4 con-
junction aspect with the North Node. From Match through
November Pluto was in opposition to the North Node, Uranus
and Jupiter. The Business Curve dropped from 11 points above
normal to 5 points below normal under this combination of un-
favorable secondary factors.

In December, 1900, two astronomical changes came about
which turned the Business Curve upward. The North Node
moved into Scorpio on December 31, 1900, and Saturn moved
into orb of a favorable 30 degree angle with Uranus.

When the North Node moved into Scorpio the curve of busi-
ness activity had reached the normal point, inasmuch as Scorpio
is the sign on the normal point of the Business Cycle Chart.
Without the presence of secondary factors to distort the Curve
up or down, business activity was now standing at normal. The
Curve rose to 5 points above normal by April, 1901, which was
due to the presence of the favorable semi-sextile aspect between
Satur and Uranus. This aspect lasted all year. Commodity
prices rose as well as Rail stocks during the year.

During January and February of 1902, the Business Curve
dropped to 2 points above normal as Jupiter formed an unfavor-

able 90 degree angle (square aspect) with the North Node. fa
April, the effect of this aspect passed away and the Business
Curve moved up three points. The Business Curve stayed between
4 and 5 points above normal during all of 1902. Saturn was in
a favorable 30 degree angle to both Uranus and Jupiter and the
latter was in a favorable 60 degree angle to Uranus.

On July 19, 1902, the North Node moved into Libra which
indicated that the natural position of the Business Curve, without
the presence of favorable or unfavorable secondary factors was
now slightly above normal.

In the fall of 1902, Saturn was in an unfavorable 90 degree
angle to the North Node. This secondary factor would have
caused a drop in the Business Curve if Saturn had not been in a
favorable 30 degree angle to Uranus. Uranus was also in a favor-
able 60 degree angle to the North Node at the same time. These
factors kept the Business Curve up through the spring of 1903.

THE RICH MAN’S PANIC—1903-1904

On January 20, 1903, Saturn moved out of Capricom and into
the sign of Aquarius. This transit took Saturn out of orb of the
favorable 30 degree angle with Uranus and brought it into an
unfavorable 45 degree angle with Uranus the first of May. The
Business Curve dropped six points by September at which time
Neptune formed an unfavorable 90 degree angle with the North
Node. This unfavorable secondary factor caused the Business
Curve to drop 11 points below normal through January, 1904,
This combination of unfavorable secondary factors brought a 17
point total drop in the Business Curve causing what is known as
the “Rich Man's Panic.” Stocks had a correspondingly sharp
drop also with Rails suffering more severely than Industrials.
According to the Dow-Jones averages, Rails dropped 18 points
from 110 to 92, and Industrials dropped 17 points from 64 to 47.

On February 7, 1904, the North Node moved into Virgo in-
dicating that the Normal position of the Business Curve was al-
most to the high point on the Business Cycle Chart. The Curve
rose six points during February under this influence, but dropped

4 points in May as Saturn formed an unfavorable 150 degree
angle with the North Node. This influence was also felt in
August, 1904, when the Business Curve stood at 5 points below
normal.

In September, 1904, the Business Curve took a sharp upturn
due to the fact that the North Node moved out of orb of aspects
with Saturn and Uraous. Jupiter was in a favorable 120 degree
angle with Uranus; and Saturn was within orb to form a favor-
able 60 degree angle with both planets. These angles were ia
force during the fall and by the end of December, 1904, the Busi-
ness Curve had risen 9 points. This recovery from the “Rich
Man’s Panic” marked the beginning of a three year period with
above-normal business volume and rising stock market prices
which has come to be known in history as the “Corporate Pros-
perity Period.”

THE CORPORATE PROSPERITY PERIOD
1905-1907

The Business Curve was three points above normal by January
of 1905 and rose six more points through June of the same year.
This was due to the favorable sextile (60 degree} angle between
Saturn and Uranus. Uranus and Saturn were also in favorable
aspect to the North Node at the same time. Uranus was forming
a ttine (120 degree) angle to the North Node and Saturn was
forming a sextile (60 degree) angle to the North Node. Three
planets in favorable aspect to each other or two planets and the
North Node in mutual favorable aspect to each other are always
accompanied by increased business volume and rising stock market
prices. This is especially true if the planets involved are Saturn,
Uranus, and Jupiter. Of course, unfavorable secondary factors
pfesent can modify these indications, but generally the upward
trend prevails,

Saturn, Uranus and the‘North Node were in mutual favorable
relationship to each other through June, 1905, and the Business
Curve rose to 9 points above normal.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

On July 21, 1905, Jupiter moved into Gemini, the sign which
is co-culer of the United States. This was a favorable secondary
factor for bullish business and Stock Market activity, but it hap-
pened that at the same time that Jupiter moved into Gemini, it
formed an unfavorable square (90 degree) angle with Satum
and the North Node. This caused the Business Curve to drop
one point; however, this was soon recovered as the North Node
moved into Leo, August 25, 1905.

Leo is the sign on the highest point of the Business Cycle Chart
and the passage of the North Node into the sign of Leo indi-
cated that business volume for a year and one-half in advance
would be at its Zenith with the norma! position of the Business
Cusve sharply above normal. The Business Curve rose from 9
points above normal to 13 points above normal through January,
1906. Besides the elevated Node position, two favorable sec-
ondary factors were present. Jupiter was in Gemini and Saturn
was in favorable relationship to Uranus, forming a sextile or 60
degree angle.

Saturn was forming a 90 degree angle (square aspect) to
Jupiter during the spring and summer of 1906. This caused a
gradual decline of four points in the Business Curve; however,
in the fall, the Business Curve recovered three points as Jupiter
moved into Cancer, one of the signs which has strong affinity for
the United States. During this time Saturn was in a 60 degree
angle to Uranus and 120 degree angle to Jupiter both of which
were favorable aspects. In January, 1907, the Business Curve
receded to nine points above normal as Jupiter moved out of orb
of aspect with Saturn and Uranus. These three points were re-
covered in March when the North Node moved into Cancer on
March 16, 1907. This high was maintained until June, 1907,
when the Business Curve showed signs of weakness. This was
due to the fact that Saturn had moved to 24 degrees Pisces in
May and was forming a very unfavorable angle (90 degrees)
with the powerful planet Pluto which was in Gemini, one of the
signs so strongly influencing the United States. Satum, in 24
degrees Pisces, had reached the sensitive degree area (24 degrees

—28 degrees Pisces) on the mid-heaven of the Chart of the New
York Stock Exchange and clearly sounded a warning signal that
the Corporate Prosperity Period was at an end and a drop in the
Business Curve was imminent.

THE PANIC OF 1907

According to this theory of forecasting business conditions to-
gether with the rise and fall of Stock Market prices, all slumps,
depressions, crashes and recessions are pointed out months in ad-
vance. The warning signals are given plainly enough and the
Panic of 1907 was no exception to this rule. Anyone familiar
with this theory knows that the position of Saturn on the mid-
heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart is a danger sig-
nal and market traders should sell and sell quick before the crash
comes. Saturn was in the sensitive degree (24 degrees to 28 de-
grees Pisces) from May to October of 1907.

The lunation of October 7, 1907, occurred in 13 degrees Libra
in square aspect (unfavorable 90 degrees angle) to Neptune, (one
of the rulers of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Ex-
change), in square aspect to Uranus and in square aspect to the
Noth Node.

Neptune at the same time was in the sensitive degree atea
(14 degrees—17 degrees Cancer) of the Ascendant of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart. This was a double indication of
trouble for business and the Stock Market. The Business Curve
dropped from 8 points above normal to 18 points below normal.
This was a sharp drop of 26 points in all for the Business
Curve. Stocks, bonds, industrial activity and business, in general,
slumped. Saturn during this period was also in unfavorable
square aspect to Pluto which was in the sign of Gemini,

The Business Curve remained at 18 points below. normal
through May, 1908. From June through December, 1908, the
Business Curve rose slowly 10 points due to the fact that Jupiter
was trine Saturn and this tended to lessen the influence of the
bad square aspect (90 degrees) between Saturn and Uranus,

The Business Curve continued to rise in 1909 as the North

Node had moved on October 1, 1908, into Gemini, the sign so
strongly influencing the United States. In this position the Node
came into conjunction with the powerful planet Pluto during the
first half of the year. In the summer of 1909, Jupiter formed a
favorable 120 degree angle with Uranus and at the same time
Saturn formed a favorable 60 degree angle with Pluto. The com-
bined influence of these two favorable secondary factors took the
Business Curve upward 13 points. By December, 1909, the Busi-
ness Curve was 9 points above normal. The Business Curve did
not hold to this level long, however, for in January, 1910, Saturn,
Jupiter and Uranus were all in unfavorable aspect to each other.
Saturn and Jupiter were square Uranus while Saturn and Jupiter
were in unfavorable opposition aspect (180 degrees). The Busi-
ness Curve began to drop during the remainder of 1910 and
reached its low of 8 points below normal in July, 1911. This
by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which broke up large trusts all
was the depression period of 1910-1911, caused to a great extent
over the country.

On April 19, 1910, the North Node entered the sign of
Taurus. This indicated that Business activity had reached a trans-
ition period which would last approximately two years, or the
time it would take for the North Node to pass through the signs
of Taurus and Aries. It further indicated that the trend of the
Business Curve would be downwatd for at least five years to come,
unless the presence of favorable secondary factors reversed the
trend temporarily during this petiod. (See Business Cycle Chart.)
This was a warning signal given in April, 1910, of a change in
the long-term or primary trend of business activity in general,
and market traders should have taken their profits and gotten out
of the market at once. The same law of action and reaction which
bad brought the tide in was now taking the tide out. In other
words, the same law of force which took the Business Cycle up-
ward was now taking the Cycle downward—action and reaction
being equal. The technical position of the Business Curve wes
around normal while the North Node transited Taurus and
slightly below normal as the North Node passed through the
position of Aries.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

During the fall of 1910, Jupiter was forming a 90 degree
angle or square aspect with both Uranus and Neptune. This un-
favorable secondary factor depressed the Business Curve six points
by the end of the year.

During the first six months of 1911 the Business Curve
dropped 2 mote points as Saturn and Uranus were in orb of a
square aspect again and Jupiter was in opposition aspect (180
degrees) to Saturn.

In July, 1911, Saturn came within otb of a trine aspect (120
degrees) with Uranus. This very favorable secondary factor lifted
the Business Curve three points through December, 1911, even
though the North Node passed into Aries November 10, 1911,
indicating that the “normal” ot technical position of the Business
Curve was below normal now.

The first six months of 1912, Jupiter was in Sagittarius and in
favorable aspect to the North Node and Uranus. This lifted the
Business Curve five points above normal. In July, 1912, Saturn
moved into Gemini and formed a favorable trine (120 degree)
aspect with Uranus. This lifted the Business Curve three more
points above normal. The high was reached ia January and Feb-
tuary, 1913, when the Business Curve stood at 9 points above
normal. After this time the Business Curve went down through
the remainder of 1913 bringing about what is known in history
as the “War Depression” period.

THE WAR DEPRESSION 1913-1914

Jupiter moved into Capricorn in January, 1913, and at the same
time formed an unfavorable square aspect (90 degrees) with the
North Node. Since the technically correct position of the Busi-
ness Curve was below the normal line the Business Curve began
to recede during the remainder of 1913.

The North Node moved into Pisces May 28, 1913. This in-
dicated a technically lower position for the Business Curve.

In September, 1913, Saturn formed a slightly unfavorable as-
pect with Uranus (sesqui-quadrate of 135 degrees) which lasted
through May, 1915. This was further accentuated by the fact that

Saturn was in Gemini, the sign which has a strong influence over
the United States. Up until 1913 this secondary factor was neu-
tralized by the fact that Saturn was in favorable aspect to Uranus.
When this aspect passed, the influence of Saturn in Gemini was
felt.

The year 1914 saw the New York Stock Exchange closed from
July to December due to the outbreak of the World War. Busi-
ness was poor and commodity prices were extremely low. Liquida-
tion of stocks held by European buyers was mainly responsible for
the closing of the Exchange. At the end of 1914 the Business
Curve stood at 14 points below the normal line.

On December 19, 1914, the North Node moved out of Pisces
into the sign of Aquarius. This sign is on the low point of the
Business Cycle Chart in this theory, and the passage of the North
Node into Aquarius indicated that the Business Curve technically
had reached its lowest point. It also indicated that business ac-
tivity would not be this low again for many years to come. In
actuality, the Business Curve did not go below this point until
seven years later in 1921,

Although the Business Curve remained below the normal line
for the first six months of 1915, it was steadily climbing, during
this period, toward the normal line which it reached in July.
This rise began as Jupiter was in conjunction with the North
Node intrine (120 degrees) aspect with Saturn. Saturn also came
within orb of a trine aspect with Uranus during the spring. These
secondary factors lifted the Curve sharply.

In July, 1915, Jupiter reached 28 degrees Pisces, the sign on
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart. This
transit pointed to rising Stock Market prices and increased busi-
ness volume which marked the latter part of 1915, all of 1916
and 1917, and part of 1918, This was the beginning of the
period known in economic history as the “War Prosperity”
period.

13 points above the normal line. This was a tise of 27 points
in all for the Business Curve or business volume for the year.
During the last six months of 1915, Uranus was in conjunction
with the North Node, and Jupiter was in a favorable semi-sextile
aspect to both Uranus and the North Node.

During all of 1916, the Business Curve remained between 13
and 16 points above normal. On July 4, 1916, the North Node

into Capricom which lifted the technical position of the
Business Curve slightly, although its “Normal” position was still
under the normal line. Favorable secondary factors, however,
lifted the Business Curve to its above normal position during this
period. Jupiter was in Aries during most of this year and there-
fore was passing over the mid-heaven of the New York Stock
Exchange Chart. This was an indication of booming industrial
activity. Jupiter's transit over this point every 12 years has usually
marked a prosperity petiod in business. activity or the beginning
of such a period in financial and economic history.

The first half of 1917 was marked by a continuation of the
high business volume of 1916 and the Business Curve remained
around 14 points above normal. On June 30, 1917, Jupiter
moved into Gemini, the sign which is co-ruler of the United
States. In December, 1917, Saturn came within orb of an un-
favorable opposition aspect (180 degrees) with Uranus. This
brought about a 5 point drop in the Business Curve which was
followed by a decrease of 2 more points in January and February,
1918, These two planets moved out of orb until August, 1918.
The presence of this unfavorable secondary factor the last half
of 1918 should have taken the Business Curve down sharply, if it
had not been, for the fact that the North Node was in Sagittarius
where it had been since January 22, 1918. In this position the
North Node was in favorable aspect to both Satum and Uranus.
This mitigated the influence of the unfavorable Satuen and Uranus
aspect to a great extent.

The effect of the unfavorable Saturn-Uranus aspect was felt
during the first six months of 1919 when the Business Curve
dropped to 8 points below normal. There was a temporary up-

turn during July and August, 1919, when Uranus formed a favor-
able trine aspect (120 degrees) with Pluto. This favorable sec-
ondary factor lifted the Curve to 7 points above normal.

The North Node passed out of Sagittarius into Scorpio August
10, 1919, lifting the technical position of the Business Curve to
the normal line. Scorpio is one of the transition points on the
Business Cycle Chart. As the North Node passes through Scorpio
and Libra it marks a two year transition period when the Curve
starts its five year trend from normal to high on the Business
Cycle Chart. Unfavorable secondary factors can lower the natural
position of the Curve from 1% to 20%. The Business Curve
dropped five points through the fall of 1919.

The Business Curve shot upwatd 11 points above normal dur-
ing January and February, 1920, under the inflationary influence
of Jupiter in conjunction with Neptune, semi-sextile Saturn and
semi-sextile Pluto. This upturn was short-lived, however, for in
March and April of 1920, the Business Curve dropped seven
points due to the fact that Saturn had come within orb of the
unfavorable 180 degree angle (opposition aspect) with Uranus.
The Business Curve remained from four to five points above
normal through August, 1920, when the Curve turned sharply
downward. This down turn of the Business Curve, which re-
mained below the normal line for the next twenty months, was
the beginning of the “Primary Post-War Depression.”

THE PRIMARY POST-WAR DEPRESSION—
1920-1922

Saturn was in opposition to the mid-heaven of the New York
Stock Exchange during the first three months of 1921 and Jupiter
was in orb of a conjunction aspect with Saturn. Mars passing
over the mid-heaven of the same Chart was in unfavorable aspect
to Saturn and Jupiter. This indicated falling stock prices, falling
bond prices and high interest rates. The Business Curve dropped
to 26 points below the normal line. During most of the year of
1921 Saturn was in conjunction with Jupiter and both planets

were in opposition aspect to Uranus. This double influence
pointed to the depression experienced during 1921.

The Moon's North Node moved into Libra, February 28, 1921,
and the technically correct position for the Business Curve was
slightly above normal where it would have been, if it had not
been for the presence of the unfavorable secondary factors men-
tioned above.

In October, 1921, both Saturn and Jupiter moved into Libra
and the Business Curve rose five points through December.

During 1922, a rapid recovery set in from the depression of
the previous years and the Business Curve rose 22 points by
September. During the first part of the year Saturn, Jupiter and
the North Node were in conjunction in Libra. During the lest
three months of 1922, Jupiter was in a favorable 120 degree angle
with Uranus (trine aspect).

On September 16, 1922, the North Node moved into Virgo.
This lifted the natural position of the Curve to a position slightly
under the high point (Leo) on the Business Cycle Chart.

The combined influence of the North Node’s passage into
Virgo and the favorable Jupiter-Uranus aspect lifted the Business
Curve 9 points above the normal line by the end of December,
1922.

During the first four months of 1923, the Business Curve rose
from 9 points above normal to 15 points above the normal line.
This cise of 6 points was due to Jupiter being trine Uranus and
semi-sextile Saturn.

From May through December, 1923, the Business Curve
dropped steadily, losing 11 points. This was due to the presence
of the secondary factor, Uranus in opposition to the North Node.
This unfavorable aspect lasted practically during the entire year.

In December, 1923, Saturn formed an unfavorable sesqui-
quadrate aspect (135 degrees) with Uranus which was in force
through the fall of 1924.

Except for a three point rise in the Business Curve during Jan-
uary and February, 1924, when Jupiter was in favorable aspect
(semi-sextile—30 degrees) to Saturn, the Business Curve dropped

£70]

 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

sharply below normal through November, 1924. Uranus was in
sesqui-quadrate aspect to Saturn and in square aspect to Jupiter.
The Curve reached its low of 13 points below normal in June.

The North Node moved into Leo, the sign on the “high”
point of the Business Cycle Chart, April 4, 1924. This transit
into Leo indicated that the technically correct position of the
Business Curve had reached its high point and that business
activity should be booming at this time if there were no unfavor-
able secondary factors present to keep the Business Curve down.
Since there were present unfavorable secondary factors during
1924, as soon as they passed, the Business Curve was bound to
tise and adjust itself to its technically correct position above the
normal line. The Business Curve rose 13 points through the sum-
met and fall and crossed the normal line in December. It had a
further rise of 4 points by the end of the month, which marked
the beginning of the ‘three-year period of above normal prices
known in history as the “Coolidge Prosperity Period.”

COOLIDGE PROSPERITY PERIOD 1925-1927

At the beginning of 1925, the Business Curve was standing at
almost 9 points above normal. From January to October, 1925,
the Business Curve receded 5 points. Two secondary factors came
into play during this period which must be noticed. (1) Saturn
and Uranus formed a favorable trine aspect (120 degrees) during
the spring and fall. (2) Uranus moved to the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart.

The favorable aspect between Saturn and Uranus mitigated the
influence of the elevated position of Uranus on the tenth house
or angle of the New York Stock Exchange Chart which was
otiginated by the writer and which gives an excellent key to the
future trend of the Stock Market. Uranus stands for the unex-

ed, the unprecedented and the unusual. The fact that it was
favorably aspected by Saturn pointed to the prosperity period at
hand as well as the rise in the Stock Market. This period marked
the beginning of the greatest Bull Market for stock prices in
financial history.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

As it has been stated before in these pages, no planet has ever

passed over the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange

Chart which has not pointed out very definite changes in the
trend of security prices, bonds, and general business activity. The

ge of Uranus over this point was a0 exception to this rule.
In fact, the wildest speculative wave in history took place during
this transit. Uranus truly brought about the “unheard-of” and
most precedent-breaking Bull Market ia financial history.

The Business Curve rose 6 points during the fall of 1925 reach-
ing 9 points above normal by January, 1926. During 1926 the
Curve fluctuated most of the year between 6 and 9 points above
normal. The fatter part of October, 1926, the Business Curve
dropped from 9 points above normal to 4 points above normal,
due to the fact that Saturn moved out of orb of the favorable
120 degree angle with Uranus.

On October 25, 1925, the North Node had moved out of Leo
into Cancer and this slightly lowering of the technical position
of the Business Curve (see Business Cycle Chart) was felt dur-
ing 1926.

The Business Curve rose to 8 points above normal through
June, 1927, and then dropped sharply through the remainder of
the year reaching 5 points below normal in November. This drop
was due to the conjunction aspect of Uranus and Jupiter in un-
favorable square aspect (90 degrees) to the North Node. This
combination of secondary factors was especially strong since
Uranus and Jupiter were both on the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart.

On May 13, 1927, the North Node moved into Gemini, the
sign which strongly influences the United States. This transit
indicated that the technical position of the Business Curve was
now slightly above normal. The planet Jupiter in Gemini, how-
ever, together with the North Node, has an expansive influence
on business in this country every 12 years when it goes through
Gemini. (The transit of Jupiter through the ruling sign of any
country brings a period of prosperity and expansion, if there is
no decidedly opposing testimony.) The passage of the North

Node into Gemini in 1927 and the transit of Jupiter into Gemini
in 1929 marked out the “Bull Market Boom” period ih financial
history, which will be long remembered in this country as one of
the greatest prosperity periods of all times.

THE “BULL MARKET BOOM,” 1928-1929

During the first six months of 1928, the Business Curve stood
between 2 and 3 points above normal due to the fact that Satur
was in unfavorable opposition aspect (180 degrees) to the North
Node. The Business Curve rose 6 points in August as Jupiter,
Uranus and the North Node were in favorable aspect. This com-
bination of favorable secondary factors was also in force through
the fall of 1928, along with a favorable 120 degree aspect (trine)
between Saturn and Uranus. The Business Curve rose from 9
points above normal to 15 points above normal during the first
six months of 1929. This was the high point reached by the
Business Curve in the “Bull Market Boom.” The high point for
stock prices was reached on September 3, 1929. The average for
Rails was 189 and the average for Industrials was 381.

On December 1, 1928, the North Node moved into Taurus.
This was a warning signal six months in advance that the “Bull
Market Boom” would soon be over. Taurus is the sign on the
Business Cycle Chart which marks the transition point in the
Business Cycle as the Business Curve goes from normal to low for
a four-year petiod. The Business Curve, as well as the Stock
Market, had to go lower in a short time, and traders could have
been saved the terrific losses they suffered if this theory of fore-
casting the Market had been known.

THE WALL STREET PANIC OF 1929
This never-to-be-forgotten panic occurred October 24, 1929,
culminating in the close of the New York Stock Exchange, for
adjustments, on October 26, 1929.
The panic was clearly pointed out by the previous lunation,
(as all stock Market crashes have been pointed out in the past).

[75]

 

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

The lunation, or New Moon, occurred October 2, 1929 in 8 de-
grees Libra, in exact opposition aspect (180 degrees) to the
chaotic and epoch-making planet Uranus which was posited on
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart. Uranus
was the “key” planet to this crash since it had been occupying
an elevated position for some time on this important angle of
the New York Stock Exchange Chart. Uranus has the most un-
usual, revolutionary, unexpected and epoch-making effects upon
conditions, and surely this financial crash, for which Uranus was
responsible, was epoch-making, It caught most traders unaware
of danger, and then wiped them out. This panic which saw
Industrial Averages plummet from a high of 381 to a low of 198
by the middle of November, and Rail averages drop from a high
of 189 to a low of 128 in the same length of time, marked the
beginning of the severe “Secondary Post-War Depression” period,
the effects of which have dominated the 1930's.

THE SECONDARY POST-WAR DEPRESSION

From October, through December, 1929, the Business Curve
dropped 16 points. Saturn moved into Capricorn November 30,
and came within orb of an unfavorable square aspect (90 degrees)
with Uranus. At the same time the North Node was in a favor-
able aspect with Uranus and this temporary favorable secondary
factor lifted the Business Curve 2 points in January and Feb-
ruary, 1930. In March, however, the Business Curve turned
downward under the influence of the unfavorable Saturn-Uranus
square aspect and by the end of the year 1930 the Business Curve
was 27 points below the normal line.

On June 19, 1930, the North Node moved into Aries, in-
dicating that the technical position of the Business Curve, without
the presence of either favorable or unfavorable secondary factors,
was now below normal and would be going stil! lower until the
North Node moved into Aquarius, which is the low point on the
Business Cycle Chart, July 28, 1933.

The powerful planet Pluto was going over the ascendent of

the New York Stock Exchange Chart during 1930 in unfavorable.

square aspect to Uranus on the mid-heaven of this same chart.
Jupiter was also in square aspect to Saturn, Uranus, Pluto and
the North Node.

During 1931, the Business Curve dropped 11 ‘points lower
than the preceding year and by the end of December was stand-
ing at 38 points below normal. Satum was in unfavorable oppo-
sition (180 degrees) aspect to Pluto and Jupiter and in unfavor-
able square aspect to Uranus. Uranus was also in unfavorable
square aspect to Pluto and Jupiter besides being in conjunction
with the North Node. Such an array of powerful unfavorable
secondary factors sent the Business Curve sharply downward dur-

The election year, 1932, saw no let up from the depression—
unemployment, strikes, bank failures, poor business and hard
times, were felt over the entire country. The Democratic Party,
which had been out of power since the Wilson Administration
(a period of 12 years), was swept into power by an overwhelming
and unprecedented victory. The Republican Party was in dis-
grace. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the man of the hour. It
is significant to mention here that Mr. Roosevelt is an Aquarian
and when he took office the North Node had moved into Aqua-
rius, the sign on the low point of the Business Cycle Chart, show-
ing that business was at a low ebb and that Mr. Roosevelt was
a man fitted by birth to handle the situation at that time. Even
more significant is the fact that Mr. Hoover is a Leo type, the
sign diametrically opposed to Aquarius, since it is its polar op-

ite. Leo is on the high point of the Business Cycle Chart,
which indicates that Mr. Hoover was not fitted by birth to handle
the depression as Mr. Roosevelt was. Mr. Hoover, as it would be
expected, favored the Capitalists and moneyed interests. Mr.
Roosevelt, on the other hand has championed the cause of the
little man. The two men stand for totally different things and
it is doubtful if either one can ever see the other's governmental
viewpoint.

To fairness to both great men it is not amiss to digress long

£78 }

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

enough here to state that Mr. Hoover was not responsible for the
depression and Mr. Roosevelt was not responsible for the recov-
ery. Both processes came about as a natural order of things—the
ebb and flow of cyclic change in finance. Mr. Hoovet’s views
were not fitted, however, to work in harmony with the process of
recovery and Mr, Roosevelt’s views were. That made all the dif-
ference.

The Business Curve dropped from 38 points below normal
to 51 points below normal by the end of 1932. The entire coun-
try was in the midst of the worst depression ever experienced and
business of all forms was at a standstill.

The North Node had moved into Pisces January 7, 1932, low-
ering the Business Curve'’s technical position further below the
normal line. The secondary factor, however, which caused such
a severe drop in the Business Curve and Stock Market averages,
was the unfavorable square aspect (90 degrees) between Uranus
on the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart and
Pluto on the ascendant of this same Chart. Due to the slow move-
ment of these planets, this aspect was in force during all of 1931,
1932, and 1933.

On July 28, 1933, the North Node moved into Aquarius, the
sign on the low point of the Business Cycle Chart. This transit
indicated according to this theory, that (1) the Business Curve
would go no lower and that (2) with the passage of the North
Node out of Aquarius, the trend of the Business Curve would
slowly swing upward for four years. During 1933, the Business
Curve rose 10 points, but it was still 40% below normal at the
end of the year. During the first part of 1934, Saturn came into
conjunction with the North Node and this unfavorable secondary
factor depressed the Business Curve about five points. Business
did not show much progress during 1934.

The real recovery, according to this theory of forecasting eco-
nomic cycles, began when the North Node passed out of the sign
Aquarius and into the sign of Capricorn February 13, 1935.
Business was still far below normal, but it moved sharply upward
toward the normal line during 1935. During the last week of

[79]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

March, 1935, a very favorable secondary factor came into force
and this aspect sent the Business Curve upward much faster than
it ordinarily would have gone. This secondary factor, which acted
as an accelerator on the Business Curve, was the sextile (60
degree) aspect between Saturn in Pisces and Uranus in Taurus.

This was the beginning of an upswing in the Stock Market,
which lasted for approximately thirteen months and which was
accompanied by marked trade improvement. The year 1935 was
hailed in Wall Street as the most encouraging period since 1929.
The Associated Press average of 60 stocks stood at 55 at the end
of the year after rising from the yeat's low of 34.8 on March 18,
1935. Recurring political and financial crises during the year did
not deter the upturn of the Stock Market. Sixteen public utility
companies advanced around 140% from their lows to the end
of the year. The reason Utilities were so prominent in their tise,
especially during the latter half of June, July, the latter part of
October and the first half of November, 1935, was due to the
fact that most of them are incorporated under the Earth (Taurus,
Virgo, Capricorn) and Water signs (Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio) .
Steels likewise come under the rulership of the Earth and Water
signs and they too had a strong rise during this year.

The presence of Saturn in Pisces (Water sign) in favorable
aspect to Uranus in Taurus (Earth sign) and in favorable aspect
to Jupiter in Scorpio (Water sign) brought about the upturn in
share values of these two prominent Groups during 1935.

The year 1936 opened bullish for the Stock Market and busi-
hess continued to improve. The rise in the Stock Market during
1936 was one of the best in history. Except for a break in April,
1936, and minor recessions during August and November, 1936,
the Bull Market in Stocks which began in March, 1935, continued
steadily upward in 1936. This was a new all-time record for
iengevity The average rise in stock market values was 25% in

The break in stock market prices, which came in April, 1936,
was clearly indicated by this theory. The rise in share values cul-
minated April 6, 1936, as Venus passed over the mid-heaven of

[80]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

the New York Stock Exchange and no favorable planets followed
this transit over this important point. Furthermore, the favorable
aspect between Saturn and Uxanus was no longer in force and
these two planets were forming an unfavorable semi-square aspect
(45 degrees) with each other. Without the presence of the favor-
able secondary factor, share values as well as the Business Curve
were Bound to have a technical reaction to adjust themselves to
their rightful position, since the favorable aspect between Saturn
and Uranus had sent the Business Curve upward much higher
than it ordinarily would have been.

The slump in stock market prices, which occurred April 27,
1936, was pointed out at the lunation of April 21, 1936. At that
time the New Moon was sesqui-quadrate Neptune, conjunction
Uranus, semi-square Satur, and trine Jupiter. The aspect which
pointed to the drop in stocks was the unfavorable aspect (135
degrees) with Neptune. Every break in the Stock Market, when
there have been no planets transitting the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart, has been pointed out at the preceding
lunation by a conjunction of an unfavorable aspect to Neptune or
Mars, the two planetaty rulers of the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart. Pisces and Aries, the two signs
which are placed on the tenth angle or mid-heaven of this Chart,
are ruled by Neptune and Mars respectively. If there is a planet
passing through or transiting over this angle of the Chast, it must
be considered along with Neptune and Mars, at any lunation,
when determining the future monthly trend for the stock market's
action.

When 2 reaction in the stock market is indicated for any
month, it is always well to notice the days following the lunation
when the Moon passes through the signs which are placed on the
angles of the chart of the New York Stock Exchange. These
signs are Cancer, Libra, Capricorn and Aries. The signs Vitgo
and Pisces are also co-rulers of the 4th and 10th angles and the
days when the Moon passes through these should also be watched.
It usually will be found that the break will occur on one of these
days. This is what happened in April, 1936. On April 27, 1936,

[81]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

when the break occurred, the Moon was in Cancet, the sign which
is the ascendant of the New York Stock Exchange Chart.

The slight recessions of August and November, 1936, were
partly seasonal dullness and occurred when the Sun was passing
through the mutable signs of Virgo and Sagittarius. These signs
being in square and opposition aspect to the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart often point out the months they
tule as dull months both for business and the stock market gen-
erally. (Gemini is the other mutable sign of the Mutable Square,
but it is the sign which strongly influences the United States;
therefore, the Sun's passage through this sign does not generally
bring a reaction or dull period in the stock market and business
each year.)

The year 1936 marks the fourth consecutive year that share
values had shown an uptrend in price. The Dow-Jones Industrial
Average at the end of 1933 stood at 99.90; at the end of 1934
at 104.04; at the end of 1935 at 144.13; and at the end of 1936
at 179.90.

The movement of the Groups during the year shows that
Industrials had the most consistent strength during 1936. Utilities
moved in a narrow price range the last half of the year. Rails
showed the widest gains and losses as a whole. Commodities ex-
perienced a Bull Market during 1936. The Bond Market also
turned sharply upward in price value, advancing 7%. Second
gtade Rail bonds had a spectacular rise of 23% in the Dow-
Jones Averages. Recovery from the depression of the early 1930's
was the feature financial and business fact of the formative year
of 1936.

1937, which was forecast ahead of time as another year of
gteater prosperity, turned out to be not so builish after all. Fore-
casts for 1937 except the published ones by the writer based on
the theory in this book, all saw greater profits in the Stock Mar-
ket for the year ahead.

The published articles of the writer, while stating that the
Business Curve was upward during 1937, wamed that Saturn

£82]

 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

was approaching 24 degrees Pisces and that a recession in stock
and bond shares would be likely to occur. The mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart is governed by 24 to 28 degrees
Pisces and Saturn’s passage over this crucial point would certainly
leave its mark, inasmuch as no major planet has ever passed over
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart without
indicating very definite changes in the stock market and subse-
quently business.

The North Node had passed into Sagittarius September 1,
1936, and this transit placed the technical position of the Business
Curve slightly below normal. However, Saturn's movement to
this elevated position on the Exchange Chart, forecast the drop
in security prices for the year as well as the slump in bonds.

The lunation occurred March 12, 1937, in 21 degrees Pisces,
in conjunction with Satum (which was in 24 degrees Pisces on
the exact angle of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Ex-
change Chart), in opposition aspect to Neptune (one of the rulers
of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart), in
semi-square aspect to Uranus, sextile aspect to Jupiter, and semi-
square aspect to Venus. On the same day that the lunation oc-
curred, Federal Bonds slumped after being easy all week. (Saturn
bad been in 24 degrees Pisces since the sixth of March, 1937!).
When the lunation fell in conjunction with Satum, it set off the
Bond slump and gave a warning that a drop in stocks was bound
to follow soon, since Saturn’s elevated position on this Chart
affected stock prices also. It is interesting to note here that Gov-
ernment Bonds were at a high the last week in January, 1937,
when Venus was in 24 degrees Pisces, in exact conjunction with
the mid-heaven of this same Chart. This slump in bonds was
registered as the greatest turnover in Government Bonds since
December, 1920, and at that time Saturn was in 24 degrees
Virgo, in exact opposition to the mid-heaven of the New York
Stock Exchange Chart.

The first symptoms of the coming Stock Market decline oc-
curred on April 7, 1937. Leading issues were off 1 to 6 points
upon the rumor of a Gold price cut. Commodities cracked with

[83]

weakness engulfing almost every commodity from metals to grains.
London and Amsterdam Markets were equally affected. The luna-
tion of March 12, 1937 had forecast this drop through the
Opposition aspect to Neptune at the lunation. On April 7th, the
Sun, Moon and Mercury were in unfavorable aspect to Neptune.

On April 26, 1937, there was a slump on the London Exchange
which caused a drop in Wall Street. (England comes under the
rulership of the sign of Avies; therefore, Saturn's passage into
Aries marked out lower bond and stock market values for that
country.)

On April 28, 1937, stocks slumped again on the New York
Stock Exchange, reaching new 1937 lows and losing 25% of
their value acquired since March, 1935. This drop was pointed
out at the lunation of April 11, 1937. The New Moon at this
time was in unfavorable sesqui-quadrate aspect to Neptune, in
semi-sextile aspect to Saturn, in square aspect to Jupiter, and in
unfavorable sesqui-quadrate aspect to Mars, and in conjunction
aspect with Venus. The two unfavorable aspects to both rulers,
(Neptune and Mars) of the mid-heaven of the Chart of the New
York Stock Exchange clearly indicated this drop. There was a
rally in stocks after this break which carried stocks to 190 in the
Dow-Jones Industrial Averages by the first part of August. This
rally brought stocks to within five points of the recovery high of
March, 1937. At the lunation of August 6, 1937, the New Moon
was in semi-sextile aspect to Neptune, in unfavorable square
aspect to Uranus, and in unfavorable sesqui-quadrate aspect to
Saturn, which is now a “key” planet in analysing the trend of
stock market prices, due to its elevated position of the mid-heaven
of the Chart of the New York Stock Exchange. The Iunation was
also in unfavorable semi-square aspect to Venus and in favorable
semi-sextile aspect to Mercury, both of which ate minor aspects in
effect. The unfavorable aspect to Satur at the lunation indicated
the downturn in stock prices, On the 14th of August, 1937, the
Sua formed an unfavorable 135 degree angle (sesqui-quadrate
aspect) with Saturn and the stock market averages tumed down-
ward. Saturn is the planet representative of fear. Its elevated

{84}

position on the 10th angle (mid-beaver) of the New York Stock
Exchange Chart indicated that fear would be a dominant mental
factor influencing market trading. Furthermore, the tenth angle
of this same Chart represents the credit, reputation, and heads
of the New York Stock Exchange and Saturn’s position here rep-
resented trouble in this division of the New York Stock Exchange
Chart. ‘This Chart which is the otiginal work of the writer, has
clearly mirrored the 1937-38 history of the Stock Market.

The lunation of September 4, 1937, fell in conjunction with
Neptune and in unfavorable square aspect to Mars, the two
planetary rulers of the New York Stock Exchange Chart’s tenth
angle or mid-heaven. This configuration clearly pointed out a
drop in the Stock Market during September, 1937. On September
7, 1937, as the Moon (symbolic of the public mind) moved
through Libra in opposition aspect to Saturn (fear) a wave of
selling took place on the London Exchange with the selling of
“Americans” which had a drastic reaction on Wall Street causing
numerous issues to drop from 1 to 10 points in a very active
market. ‘This was the worst drop since September 24, 1931. There
was @ share turnover of 1,700,000 shares, As the Sun moved into
conjunction with Neptune and in unfavorable square aspect (90
degrees) with Mars, the two rulers of the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart, stocks dropped from $1.00 to
$6.00 a share after the break on Tuesday, September 7, 1937.
This was the greatest decline since October 17, 1930. Several
individual issues were down as much as 13 points. The Industrial
average was off 8.38 points.

On September 24, 1937, as the Sun moved in opposition to
Saturn, which is placed in a key position on the Exchange Chart’s
mid-heaven, heavy fear selling, both here and abroad, took place.
As many as 538 issues plummetted to new lows with stock prices
losing two billion id value.

The crashes in the Stock Market, which took place on October
18 and 19, 1937, were pointed out by the lunation or New
Moon of October 4, 1937. At this time the Moon was in opposi-
tion to Saturn and in square aspect to Mars. Mars and Satum

[85]

were in unfavorable square aspect to each other. On the 18th of
October, the Moon was in conjunction with Saturn and in un-
favorable square aspect to Mars. This break was the worst for
stocks since 1930. On the 19th of October, 1937, stocks slumped
again with the heaviest selling in four years. There were 932
lows with 7,287,990 shares traded. This was the greatest volume
since July 21, 1933. Venus was in opposition to Saturn on this

Saturn rules fear and this present recession has been the result
of public fear. The mind of the trading public has been stim-
ulated to believe in such unreal states of consciousness as lack,
loss, depression and bad business. These conditions could not
manifest themselves in actuality, if they were not thought and
believed first. In the near future, economists and Governmental
heads will contcol booms and depressions through the realisation
that booms and depressions are man-made and the outward results
of men’s thoughts. The Government will then be the master of
economic conditions in this country instead of its helpless victim
in times of depression.

At the end of 1937 Bond prices were 11.9% lower than at the
end of 1936. The Dow-Jones Average for Industrials was 32.8%
lower than it was at the end of 1936. Dow-Jones Rail Averages
were 45.1% below what they were a year ago. The Dow-Jones
Utilities Average was 41.6% below what it was at the end of
1936. Business, in general, was 23.5% lower than at the end
of 1936. Commodity prices also were lower than a year ago.
The year 1937 which had begun so bullish ended definitely
bearish.

The “Recession of 1937” continued into part of 1938 with only
brief rallies in the Stock Market. The first half of the year brought
about the failure of Richard Whitney and Co. and the subse-
quent reorganization of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr.
Whitney was five times President of the New York Stock Ex-
change, and one of the most prominent members of the Exchange.
His conviction for embezzlement reflected on the credit (10%
bouse matter on the Exchange Chart) of the New York Stock

[86]

Exchange. Saturn’s position elevated in the mid-heaven (106
house) of the New York Stock Exchange pointed out trouble in
regard to officials and the credit standing of the New York Stock
Exchange. This brought about a change in government of the
Exchange with the installation of the first paid president of the
New York Stock Exchange in history.

The month of March, 1938, saw Stock Market prices drift
lower with business activity dull. The lunation of March 2, 1938,
fell in unfavorable opposition aspect to Neptune, one of the
rulers of the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange and a
planet which is usually unfavorably aspected at any lunation pre-
ceding a drop in the Stock Market. One of the worst drops of the
month came on March 29, 1938, when a selling wave took place
and stocks plunged to 1932 levels. Stocks went to three year
lows with the entire list off. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average
dropped 5.33 points. As many as 1,720,000 shares changed
hands. The Moon in Pisces on this date was in opposition aspect
to Neptune, and as it passed over the degree and place of the
lunation, the unfavorable aspects of the New Moon of March 2,
1938, came into effect.

On March 23, 1938, the North Node moved into Scorpio, the
sign which is placed on the “normal or transition” point of the
Business Cycle Chart. This indicated that the Business Curve
should adjust itself to normal, if no unfavorable planetary aspects
were present to act as secondary factors, which would keep the
Business Curve below normal.

A favorable secondary factor of minor strength came into play
in April and this aspect will be in effect most of 1938. It is the
semi-sextile aspect between Saturn and Uranus. Stock did im-
prove in value and business activity assumed renewed vigor dur-
ing the summer months of 1938 and on through the rest of the
year. Saturn in its “key” position on the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange is still unfavorable, but the fact that it is
favorably aspected by Uranus will mitigate this unfavorable in-
fluence to a great extent. The Business Curve, having reached
its technical “normal” point according to this theory, also in-

{87}

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

dicated that Business would improve and stocks advance during
1938. This was a good year to buy. The semi-sextile aspect is not
as strong as the favorable sextile aspect (60 degree angle) be-
tween Saturn and Uranus which took share values upward so
strongly during 1935-1936. It just has half the strength of that
aspect, but it is aided by the fact that the North Node is in Scor-
pio and has reached the technically “normal” point on the Busi-
ness Cycle Chast. This fact should help the Business Curve with
the presence of the minor favorable secondary factor, go slightly
above normal during the last six months of the year. During
1935-36, the technically correct position of the Business Curve
was “below normal,” but the favorable secondary factor of 60
degrees between Saturn and Uranus was very strong and this
lifted the Curve sharply. The first half of 1938 did not look
as strong as the last half of the year, since the Saturn-Uranus as-
pect did not come within orb until April, 1938, and was not exact
until June.

Despite the fact that the Saturn-Uranus aspect was in force dur-
ing the latter half of 1938, the lunations from August to the end
of the year unfavorably aspect Neptune; therefore, it is not pos-
sible to state which condition will outweigh the other and trad-
ing caution is advised towards the end of the year. Two forces
seem to be pulling against each other during this year.

1939

During 1939 two astronomical factors come into play which
will affect the trend of stock prices, bond prices, and general
business activity. The first factor is the passage of Jupiter into
the sign of Pisces where it will pass over the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart. Jupiter’s position here indi-
cates rising stock market prices, rising bond prices and the return
of the prestige of the New York Stock Exchange. The summer
months do not appear as strong as the spring and fall. No planet
has ever passed over the mid-heaven of the New York Stock

[88]

 

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

Exchange Chart which has not brought definite changes in the
security and bond markets, Business has usually followed the
Stock Market's trend.

Jupiter, unlike Saturn, is a planet of expansion, and favors
prosperity and the upturn of security prices and business gen-
erally. Even though Jupiter has Saturn in the mid-heaven with it
also, Saturn will have moved fat enough away not to cause much
trouble. Therefore, 1939 will prosper the new organization of
the New York Stock Exchange and the trading public will renew
its confidence once more in the market.

The second astronomical factor which will play an important
part in business activity during 1939, is the fact that the North
Node passes out of Scorpio on October 10, 1939, and into the
sign of Libra. This indicates that the Business Curve is now going
from normal to high on the Business Cycle Chart and, if there
are no unfavorable secondary factors present to lower the Curve,
Business activity should go slightly above normal during the next
twelve months.

From the joint testimony of the astronomical factors involved,
it is evident that 1939 should be a very good year both for busi-
ness and the stock market, making allowances, of course, from
time to time, for any temporary dullness that is apt to occur as
part of daily and monthly trends.

WHAT OF THE FUTURE—1940-1950?

The next ten years will mark one of the most crucial decades
in the history of this country.

The North Node will be going through the signs Libra, Virgo,
and Leo duting a four year period, 1940-44. This indicates that
the technical position of the Business Curve will be going from
normal to high and that the Business Curve will reach its “high”
point as the North Node transits Leo during 1943 and 1944.
Business activity should be above normal during this four year
period, if there are no unfavorable secondary planetary factors
ptesent to lower the Curve. This is the basic underlying frame-
work upon which the secondary factors will work. On the Busi-

[ 89}

CHART OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

 

[90}

43

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

ness Cycle Chart these signs are going from normal to above
normal, with the sign Leo marking the “high” point.

From June, 1944, to July, 1947, the North Node will be pass-
ing through Cancer and Gemini and will reach the sign of Taurus
in July, 1947. During this three year period, the Business Curve
will be slowly going from “high” to “normal” on the Business
Cycle Chart or business activity will be slowly going from “above
normal" activity to “normal.”

When the North Node reaches Taurus in July, 1947, this is a
warming signal that the Business Curve has reached its technically
normal position and that this transit marks out a transition period
before the Business Curve turns definitely downward for a four
year period.

Saturn and Uranus will also be in orb of a conjunction aspect
during 1940, 1941, and 1942 in Taurus, Saturn and Uranus in
conjunction aspect usually brings declining prices, depression,
and financial panics. This is a warning ahead of time to the gov-
ernmental heads of this country that this country is headed for a
mote severe depression than the one which we have just been
through unless steps are taken now to prevent its occurrence.

From May, 1941 until June, 1942, Jupiter will be in the sign
of Gemini, which strongly influences the United States. This will
mitigate to some extent the unfavorable influence of the Saturn
aod Uranus conjunction. Jupiter's passage through Gemini is
usually accompanied by rising prices and bullish business con-
ditions. Two sets of financial conditions will mark this period
due to the presence of both favorable and unfavorable secondary
factors.

The presence of three major planets, Satur, Jupiter, and
Uranus, in orb of a conjunction aspect with each other in the
sign of Taurus portend drastic and unusual conditions affecting
this country during the last half of 1940 and the first half of
1941. Now is the time to prepare for the future and prevent the
happening of conditions which we do not want to occur.

In May, 1942, both Saturn and Uranus enter the sign of
Gemini, which depicts conditions affecting the United States as a

[91]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

whole. This conjunction of these two powerful planets in the
sign ruling the United States is very significant. Depression and
financial difficulties will engross the entire country, unless the
most drastic steps are taken by those at the head of our Goverm-
ment. This configuration of planets is even more significant when
the fact is taken into consideration that the transit of Uranus
through Gemini every 84 years has brought war to this country.
In 1776 Uranus was in Gemini and we had the Revolutionary
War. Then, 84 years later {it takes Uranus 84 years to pass
through the twelve signs of the zodiac and return to its starting
point) Uranus was again in Gemini, and the Wac between the
States occurred in 1860. Since the Civil War, Uranus has not
been in the sign of Gemini, but goes into that sign in May, 1942.
It is doubly significant at this time since it is in conjunction with
Saturn, also in Gemini, and will be placed in this relationship
through June, 1944. Uranus has never passed through Gemini
without bringing war, depression, and declining prices. Saturn
has never passed through Gemini during the past 72 years with-
out bringing a business depression, financial panic or war. Since
1850, Saturn has passed through the sign of Gemini three times
and each transit has marked a critical period in the history of this
country. Saturn was in Gemini in 1855-56. The Panic of 1857
followed this transit. The years 1883-84-85 again saw Saturn in
the sign of Gemini and the Panic and Depression of 1884 took
place. Saturn was again in Gemini from 1912 to 1914. This
transit brought about the entrance of this country into the World
War and the subsequent closing of the New York Stock Ex-
change.

In view of this imposing testimony, taken when Saturn and
Uranus have passed through Gemini singly, it is little wonder

that the combined strength of these two planets portend a most .

critical time in this country’s history. This combination of plan-
etary influence points out war, depression, governmental change,
social upheaval, and a financial panic. None of this unpleasant
picture has to materialize, if steps are made now to acquaint our
Governmental heads with the laws that govern our universe.

[92]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

A knowledge of astrology is the only way out. It is doubtful,
though, that mankind will do anything about it, for they are
unwilling to learn how the majority of our people have reacted
to planetary stimuli in the past.

During 1944, 1945, and 1946 Saturn will pass through the
sign of Cancer, which rules the ascendant of the New York
Stock Exchange Chart, and a sign which strongly influences the
United States also. This indicates some drastic changes in the
financial world, the New York Stock Exchange itself, and in the
Government during these three years.

Uranus will be in Gemini until June, 1949. Thus it will be
in this country’s ruling sign for about seven years.

During October, November, and December, 1944, and during
the first nine months of 1945, Saturn and Uranus will be in a
minor favorable semi-sextile aspect (30 degrees). This may result
in improved business conditions and an upturn in security prices
during this time. This aspect, however, is of minor strength and
it is hard to tell just how much of a rise, if any, it will bring.

During the fall of 1947, during all year of 1948, and until the
fall of 1949, a very favorable secondary factor will be in force
which should cause stocks to rise, bonds to rise, and business
boom generally. This aspect is the major favorable sextile aspect
(60 degree angle) between Saturn and Uranus. It was this aspect
which caused the tise in security prices during 1935-37.

The Moon’s North Node moves into Aries January 31, 1949.
This indicates that the technical position of the Business Curve is
now below normal, even though favorable secondary factors keep
the Curve above normal until the aspect passes. This occurs in
the late fall of 1949.

During 1950, Saturn is in the sign of Virgo and is moving
toward an opposition aspect with the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart. This indicates that in the fall of
1950 bond and security prices will go lower and possibly slump.

On August 19, 1950, the Moon’s North Node passes into
Pisces taking the technical normal position of the Business Curve
further below the normal line. In December, 1950, Saturn

£93}

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

forms a very unfavorable square (90 degree) aspect with Uranus,
and prices will go much lower with business activity far below
normal. Stocks and bonds will be in a Bear Market in the midst
of a depression period well into 1951.

The information given in this ten year general outlook will
make money for those individuals who plan their financial future
ahead of time. For those who are not interested in a planned
financial future, there is little chance that they will be able to sur-
vive the next decade with its financial upheavals. The old hit-
and-miss system, guess work, and methods which have worked
during the preceding business cycles will be of little use in the
complicated ten years we are to go through shortly.

Time will confirm the truth contained in this forecast. The
recognition of this method of forecasting economic cycles should
be brought to the attention of the present Administration, and
patticularly to the attention of those who hope to be in power
after 1940. Much can be done by the present Administration in
the remaining two years (this is being written early 1938) to
prevent the collapse of our economic structure, in the future, but

the laws of nature, governing supply and demand, must be =
nized and utilized now. Pey me Bees

Chapter HI

How to Forecast Monthly and Daily
Trends on the New York Stock Exchange

Te most reliable method for forecasting monthly trends on
the New York Stock Exchange for any desired month in
advance is to take the planetary positions at the lunation of the
previous month and place these planetary positions in their
tight positions on the Chart of the New York Stock Exchange.
A copy of this Chart, which was originated by the writer after
a long period of economic research, accompanies this chapter.
Any bookstore that deals in astrological supplies carries pads of
blank astrological charts and a copy of this chart can be quickly
drawn off on a blank chart by simply copying the house-cusps,
signs and degrees.

The planetary positions for every month, at the time of the
lunation or New Moon, are given for every year from 1938
through 1950 in Chapter VI of this book. The planetary aspects
ot angular relationships of the planets at the time of the luna-
tion are also given in this chapter. This information will prove
invaluable in guiding traders as to just what the Stock Market
will do during the ensuing twenty-eight days.

The best way to learn how to forecast the Stock Market's trend
in advance is to take an “example month” and work it out. After
doing a number of charts for months in advance and then watch-
ing the reaction of the Stock Market as it actually takes place,
anyone can soon learn to get a quick off-hand knowledge of what
to expect in the Stock Market. The value of this method lies in
the fact that it tells you at any time in advance WHAT month the
Stock Market is apt to have a sharp drop or what month the

[95]

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
STOCK MARKET CHART

 

[96]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

Stock Market is apt to be strongly bullish. No other method
used today by chart-readers offers such advantages.

For an “example month,” when a lower trend for stocks was
clearly pointed out, let us take the month of March, 1938. The
entire month was marked by a drop in the various stock market
averages and many stocks dropped to 1932 lows. How was this
fact pointed out?

Turning to the Ephemeris in Chapter VI, we find that each
New Moon or Iunation occurs every twenty-eight days and that
this lunation, by the angular relationship of the planets at the
time of the New Moon, points out the trend of the New York
Stock Market during the coming twenty-eight days.

The nearest Junation or New Moon, which precedes the month
of March generally, occurred March 2, 1938. (As a mle the
lunation affecting the coming month is given in the month be-
fore, which in this case would be February, 1938. The Ephemeris,
however, states that there was “no New Moon in February”; so
the Innation of Match 2, 1938 is used to give the indications for
the month of March).

On March 2, 1938, at the time of the Innation, the positions
of the planets were as follows: Sun 10 degrees Pisces; Moon 10
degrees Pisces; Neptune 20 degrees Virgo retrograde; Utanus 10
degrees Tausus; Saturn 4 degrees Aries; Jupiter 16 degrees
Aquarius; Mars 22 degrees Aries; Venus 17 degrees Pisces;
Mercury 5 degrees Pisces. The Moon's North Node, which de-
fines the general curve of economic cycles, was in 1 degree Sagit-
tarius. ‘These planets placed around a skeleton New York Stock
Exchange Chart pointed out, by their positions and angular rela-
tionships to each other, the unstable Stock Market condition of
March, 1938.

It is necessary in this subject as well as in any other subject to
use abbreviations and symbols whenever possible to conserve both
time and energy. It is easy to place the signs with their degrees
around the skeleton chart of the New York Stock Exchange
whereas it is awkward and tedious to write the words and de-
gtees out on the chart. From now on the abbreviations and

“short-hand” symbols for the signs and planets as well ss their
angles will be used in this chapter and other parts of the book;
therefore 2 brief table is given here for the reader to familiarize
himself with and the more quickly these symbols are learned, the
easier it will be to give a quick and accurate judgment of stock
conditions at any time.

The Sun and Moon are not strictly planets in an astronomical
sense, but in this work they are so labelled in order to simplify
matters.

It also will be noticed that two planets have rulership over
two signs each, This is due to the fact that there are only ten
planets known. Like the chemist, we use what we have, although

[98]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

we know at some time two planets will be discovered which
rule Taurus and Gemini. However, every planet has a sign in
which it is almost as strong as in the sign it rules; therefore, it
is all tight to use Veous and Mercury as the rulers of Taurus
and Gemini until research in astronomy gives us the two missing
planets.

It is also necessary to know a few elementary facts regarding
the Chart of the New York Stock Exchange. These facts apply
to all charts, and they should be learned carefully.

Each chart has twelve sections, one for each sign of the zodiac.
The signs placed on these twelve cusps or spokes are atranged
counter-clockwise, and so are the planets. Each sign has 30
degrees in it and the degree which falls on the cusp tells where
a planet is to be placed on the chart. For instance, on the exam-
ple chart for March the Sun (©) and Moon ()) fell in 10
degrees Pisces. Since this degree falls before 24-28 degrees
Pisces (3¢) which is the sign on the tenth cusp, the Sun and
Moon fall in the 9th section of the chart instead of the 10th
section or “house.” The planet Uranus, on this chart, fell in
10 degrees Taurus (% ) and since zero degrees Taurus falls on
the 11th section of the chart, Uranus actually falls in the 11th
section or “house.” (The twelve sections of a chart are called
“houses”’.)

It sometimes happens that a sign will be intercepted in a
“house”, making two signs with their corresponding planetaty
rulers, governors of that particular section. This is due to the
fact that charts set up for different latitudes “cut” the zodiac into
different sized sections.

Most charts will have degrees and minutes on the cusp of the
ist house or ascendant, but it will be noticed that the Chast of
the New York Stock Exchange has the connotation “14-17 de-
grees Cancer (o5)" on the first house or ascendant and the nota-
tion 24-28 degrees Pisces (3¢) on the tenth house or mid-
heaven of the same Chart. Do not let this confuse you. It
merely means that these degrees have been found to include a
sensitive area in connection with stock market trends whenever
subject to planetary transits.

Most of the terms and words used in this work, not generally
used in the average person's vocabulary, are included in Chapter
VII, entitled “Glossary of Terms”, where they can be found for
ready reference at any time. Ao explanation here, however, was
deemed advisable, inasmuch as few persons can understand a
chart who have not had some instruction along the above lines.

The Chart of the New York Stock Exchange becomes more
comprehensible with the above facts in mind.

Any month up to 1950 may be forecast for any time in advance
by placing the lunation Planetary positions affecting the month in
question around a copy of the New York Stock Exchange Chart.

After the planets have been placed around the chart in their
ptoper house positions, the following facts must be sought:

(1) If there are any major planets placed in the 10th house
or mid-heaven of the chart; if there are any planets placed in the
1st house or ascendant of the chart; and if there are any planets
in the 4th house or 7th house of the chart. The angles listed
here are given in the order of their importance; that is, LOth, 1st,
4th and 7th, in diagnosing market conditions.

If there are major planets (that is, all the planets except Venus
and Metcuty) in the houses or sections mentioned they become
so-called “‘key" planets, for aspects to them at a lunation become
highly important in making market forecasts.

Planets on the mid-heaven or 10th house are the most impor-
tant of all in making judgment of stock trends for the coming
month. These planets are to be taken into account along with
the two rulers of the 10th house or mid-heaven of the New York
Stock Exchange Chart. These rulers are Neptune and Mars,
because they tule the signs Pisces and Aries respectively, which
are placed on this section of the chart.

(2) If the lunation or New Moon is in favorable or unfavor-
able aspect to Neptune or Mars, the two rulers of the mid-
heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart; if the lunation
ot New Moon is in favorable aspect to the “key” planet or in
unfavorable aspect to the “key” planet (if there is one).

(3) The last point, which should be noted particularly, in

[ 100 }

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

connection with market conditions is the fact whether Saturn and
Uranus are in favorable aspect to each other; in unfavorable
aspect to each other; or not in aspect at all.

If Saturn and Uranus are in favorable aspect with each other
that is, placed 120, 60, or 30 degrees from each other, the Stock
Market will rise for the extent of this aspect. The aspects are
given in the order of their strength or impostance. That is, the
trine aspect, sextile aspect and semi-sextile aspect.

If Saturn and Uranus are in unfavorable aspect with each other,
that is, placed in conjunction, 180, 90, 135 or 45 degrees from
each other, the trend of stocks will be down for the extent of
the aspect.

The conjunction aspect between Saturn and Uranus, if powet-
fully aspected by Jupiter or Neptune, from a favorable angle, is
variable and may or may not point out a drop in the Stock
Market. The unfavorable aspects between Saturn and Uranus are
listed in the order of their strength or importance, that is, the
conjunction, opposition, square, sesqui-quadrate and semi-square

There ace 360 degrees in a chart and it is an easy matter
to determine whether planets are in favorable or unfavorable
aspect to each other by simple arithmetic. However, for readers
who are not mathematically inclined, the following table will

Planets which are in the same sign of the zodiac, and within
9 degrees of each other, are in conjunction aspect. The symbol
for the conjunction aspect is ¢. (For example, a planet in 2
degrees Aries and a planet in 7 degrees aspect are in conjunction
aspect, because they are within 9 degrees of each other. A planet
in 1 degree Aries and a planet in 10 degrees Aries are in con-
junction aspect because they ate within 9 degrees of each other,
etc.).

Planets which are placed one sign apart, or 30 degrees apart,

way. The symbol for the semi-sextile aspect is y.

Planets which are two signs apart are in sextile aspect (60
degrees), if they ate within 5 degrees of each other. The sign
for the sextile aspect is >.

Planets which are one and a half signs apart are in semi-square

quadrate aspect (315 degrees), if they are within 3 degrees of
each other.

This table of aspects and angles, with their symbols, will give
all the information necessary in reading a chart. The lunation or
New Moon aspects have already been worked out and they are
given in Chapter VI of this book along with the planetary posi-
tions of each New Moon.

After the planets have been placed around the example Chart
of the New York Stock Exchange for March, 1938, several fac-
tors are noticeable. (See Figure I on page 104).

(1) The first factor is that the depressing planet Saturn is
placed in the mid-heaven or 10th house of the chart.

(2) Mars, one of the planetary rulers of the mid-heaven of
the chart, is in the 10th house or mid-heaven.

(3) The aspects in force at the lunation showed no aspects
to either Mars or Saturn, but the lunation did show Neptune in
opposition aspect to the Iunation (conjunction of the Sun and
Moon).

Neptune is one of the rulers of the mid-heaven of the New
York Stock Exchange Chart, and the fact that the lunation formed
an unfavorable opposition aspect to it showed a slump in stock
prices. Since the lunation made no aspect to either Mars or
Saturn, their influence would not be brought into effect at this
time. Unfavorable aspects to Neptune at 2 lunation, especially,
if no favorable aspect between Saturn and Uranus was in force
at the same time, usually indicates a sharp break in stock market

TICES.

Saturn and Uranus, although one sign apart, were not in orb
of aspect for a semi-sextile aspect, since they were six degrees
apart. Three degrees apart is the maximum orb for this aspect, as
is given in the above tabulation.

The conclusion reached, through this method of forecasting
the trend of the Stock Market, was that prices were going lower
at this time and that March might possibly witness a slump or
sharp break during the month.

to the newspapers for March, stocks went lower during the entire
month, and on March 29, 1938, as the Moon passed over the
degree of the lunation of March 2, 1938, the full force of the
unfavorable aspect to Neptune was brought into play and stocks
plunged downward in a selling wave that hit three yeat lows.
Stocks were at their 1932 level.

For an “example month” when an upturn in stock market
prices was indicated (at the lunation occurring previous to the
upturn) we will take the month of June, 1938.

By turning to the EPHEMERIS in Chapter VI, we see that a
funation or New Moon occurred on May 29, 1938, and on June
27, 1938. Since we want the lunation covering the month of
June, 1938, we will take the lunation of May 29, 1938. (The
New Moon of June 27, 1938 would cover the month of July,
1938.)

The planetary positions on May 29, 1938, were as follows:
“Sun 6 degrees Gemini; Moon 6 degrees Gemini; Neptune 18
degtees Virgo, retrograde; Uranus 15 degrees Taurus; Saturn 14
degrees Aries; Jupiter 1 degree Pisces; Mars 23 degrees Gemini;
Venus 5 degrees Cancer; Mercury 13 degrees Taurus. The
Moon’s North Node was in 27 degrees Scorpio. Aspects in
force at this lunation were Sun and Moon semi-square Saturn;
square Jupiter; semi-sextile Venus.”

When these planetary positions are placed around the New
York Stock Exchange Chart (see Figure Il on page 106), we find
three notable facts:

(2) The lunatior. (conjunction of the Sun and Moon evety
twenty-eight days) made no aspect to Neptune or Mars, the two
planetary rulers of the New York Stock Exchange Chart’s mid-
heaven or 10th house.

(2) The two planets which point out major trends in the
Stock Market, Saturn and Uranus, were in close semi-sextile aspect
(30 degrees) which is favorable.

(3) At the same time Mercury was in conjunction with
Uranus; and both Mercury and Uranus wete in a very favorable
trine (120 degrees) aspect with Neptune. Mercury also was in

PLANETARY POSITIONS—MAY 29, 1938 ' favorable semi-sextile aspect to the very powerful planet Saturn.
NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE CHART

Favorable aspects between Saturn and Uranus always indicate |
an upturn in the stock market which will last as long as the
aspect is in force. All aspects between Saturn and Uranus are
very significant in studying stock market trends. The semi-
sextile aspect did not come into effect between these two planets
until they had become almost exact due to the fact that the semi- !
sextile aspect is only a minor favorable aspect and the orb of its :
influence does not extend beyond an area of three degrees (see ||:
the tabulation of aspects and their orb of influence listed in this
Chapter).

One fact should be pointed out here. Raphael's Ephemeris
lists the lunation of May 29, 1938, as in semi-square aspect to
Saturn. They allow large orbs of influence and in this work we i|
allow only three degrees for a semi-square aspect orb; therefore,
although listed as such in the Ephemeris the lunation did not :
actually form a semi-squate aspect to Saturn, unless wide orbs H|
of influence are used, and these have not been found advisable
in studying stock market trends. Ai

Although the upturn in the stock market was indicated for the
month of June, the rise did not begin until June 20, 1938. On it
this date the Moon was passing over the mid-heaven of the New !
York Stock Exchange Chart. It is a noticeable fact that when vk
marked daily changes occur in the stock market, such as a sharp
drop or a sharp rise, the Moon is usually in one of the angles of
the New York Stock Exchange Chart, that is in the signs Pisces,
Aries, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, or Capricorn.

Mars is usually involved when there is an active stock market.
either for buying or selling. In this case we find that at the
lunation of May 29, 1938, Mars was in 23 degrees Gernini and
unaspected. Mercury which was in conjunction with Uranus
and semi-sextile Saturn at the time of the lunation, reached 23-25
degrees Gemini, the place of Mars at the lunation over the week-
end and came into play in stock market action Monday, June 20,
1938. Mercury was the planet which acted to bring the lunation
indications into force, since it was the planet which aspected

Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune at the new Moon. If Saturn or
Uranus had been strongly aspected by the lunation, the Moon's
passage, or the Sun's passage, over 23-25 degrees Gemini, the
place of Mars at the lunation, would have brought out the upturn
in the stock market predicted May 29, 1938. This is further
proof that the lunation was not in orb of a semi-square aspect
with Saturn, in so far as this work is concerned, even though it
is listed in the Ephemeris as such. Wide orbs do not work in
forecasting stock market conditions and none should be used
except those given in this Chapter; otherwise your market fore-
casting wili go sadly awry.

Thus it is seen that the rise in the stock market averages was
foretold by the fact that Satuen and Uranus came into favorable
aspect with each other in June, 1938. This fact was pointed out
at the previous lunation of May 29, 1938, by Mercury being in
conjunction with Uranus; both planets being in semi-sextile
aspect to Saturn, a key planet, since it is placed on the mid-
heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart; and both
Mercury and Uranus being in very favorable trine (120 degrees)
aspect with Neptune, one of the rulers of the mid-heaven of the
New York Stock Exchange Chart.

When Mercury reached the place of Mars, the other ruler of
the mid-heaven of the New York Stock Exchange Chart, and a
planet usually involved in active stock market buying and selling,
on Monday, June 20, 1938, the stock market rise began.

Aspects between Saturn and Uranus govern major bull and
bear markets, as well as secondary rises and slumps, and this
upturn in the stock market will last as long as the favorable aspect
between Saturn and Uranus is in force. The semi-sextile aspect
between Saturn and Uranus has just half the force of the sextile
aspect (60 degrees) which existed between Saturn and Uranus
from March, 1935 and effected market conditions until August,
1937. ‘Traders should keep this fact in mind. The Dow-Jones
Industrial Averages stood at 107.74 May 31, 1938, and by July
2, 1938, had risen to 138.53. With a little practice, anyone who
studies the rules laid down in this chapter can forecast the major

uptuens and downturns in the stock market averages. The
monthly and daily trends of the stock market are easily forecast
through the method and rules laid down in this chapter. Like
any other subject, practice, in analysing market conditions through
this method, makes for perfection and accuracy.

‘The rules laid down in this Chapter are particularly applicable
for studying the fluctuations in the Dow-Jones Stock Market
Averages.

This method of forecasting the trend of the stock market is in
its infancy and offers unlimited possibilities for research and
study. For the first time in history, it offers a method for fore-
casting economic cycles years, months and days in advance, which
is based on natural law. The study of these rules will doubly
fepay anyone. It offers to the man with a small capital a chance
for economic security. Above all, it teaches you when to get in
and when to get out of the stock market.

All that is written in this book is not all there is to the subject.
That would require many books to contain so vast an amount of
economic history. It is, however, an attempt to place economic
security within the reach of all through a method of planned
investment and economic research.

No one can account for slumps and booms in reality. Any
number of reasons are given out after the condition occurs ex-
plaining its reason for happening. This is all right as far as
it goes, but our theory goes farther, it tells you in advance how
to prevent the manifestation of an undesirable economic condition.
Extremes ate not desirable. Booms are inevitably followed by
depression and human suffering. This book points out a way
for a more stable national security.

Chapter V

How to Forecast Trends of Individual
Stocks

NON would be more advantageous to the average trader
than a simplified method whereby he could tell at a glance
the future possibilities of a stock for investment purposes. This
chapter offers such a system based on the transits of the major
planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) in aspect
to the Sun, Moon, and planetary ruler of the sign under which
the stock was incorporated. (The twelve signs of the zodiac and
their planetary rulers ave given in Chapter II). Usually the
trends of most stocks (either up, down or steady) conforms to
the general trend of the Stock Market, but there are always some
stocks which move opposite to the general trend and it is very
important to know these stocks to avoid tying up money in 2
company which is not going to show profit. Secondly, everyone
wants to know when a stock has reached a low buying level and
the only way this information can be obtained is by studying the
stock individually and noting what the stock has done in the past.
Chapter V in this book gives the date and place of incorporation
of every important stock listed at the present time on the New
York Stock Exchange. It is a simple matter to work out the
planetary positions from the date and place of incorporation and
to then set these planetary positions around a chart as in Example
I, the chart of U. S. Steel, and find out by studying the transits to
the planetary positions of the stock in question what it offers in
the way of profitable investment for the future.

The transits of the planets are given for every month from
1938 through 1950 in Chapter VI.

{110}

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

The best way to learn how to forecast the future possibilities
of a stock is to take a stock as an example and go through the
process. By repeating the process several times, it becomes an
easy matter to tell what any stock will do in the next twelve years.

As “Example I” let us take U. S. Steel (X). To be able to
forecast this stock is important for several reasons. It is the
leading stock of the Steel industry and any move made by this
company is always regarded significantly by the business and finan-
cial world. During the September and October, 1937 slumps,
U. S. Steel and the general trend of the Stock Market moved so
similarly that an investigating committee, probing the cause of the
slumps, studied the trading volume of U. S. Steel exclusively.
Dividends paid by this company are always watched closely as
indications of future market action. In order to study this im-
portant stock according to the transit method of this Chapter, it
is necessary to know its planetary positions, which are given in
Chapter V.

The list of stocks, arranged alphabetically in Chapter V, giving
the planetary positions of some important stocks listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, follows the order of stocks listed on
the “Big Board” which appear daily in the newspapers. The
planetary positions of a stock are obtained from its incorporation
date, if this is known; otherwise from its date of establishment
or organization date.

In order to find the planetary positions of U. S. Steel, we turn
to Chapter V and run down the alphabet until we come to the
stock listing:

“U. S. STEEL (X) incorporated February 23, 1901, in New
Jersey. Sun 4 degrees Pisces; Moon 4 degrees Taurus; Neptune
26 degrees Gemini Retrograde; Uranus 16 degrees Sagittarius;

Saturn 13 degrees Capricorn; Jupiter 6 degrees Capricorn; Mars’

2 degrees Virgo Retrograde; Venus 17 degrees Aquarius; Mer-
cuty 21 degrees Pisces; the Moon’s North Node 27 degrees
Scorpio.”

The next step is to place these planetary positions on a chart
or wheel as in “Example I.” The Sun’s degree is placed on the

ascendant or first house with the Sun on the cusp of the first
house. (See the chart of U. S. Steel, which is Example 1). The
other eleven cusps of the chart take the next degree, which in
this case is 5, and the signs follow in their natural order until
there is a sign on all the cusps of the chart. The Sun’s degree was
4 Pisces in the case of U. S. Steel. The sign following Pisces
is Aries and it carries the figure 5 to show 5 degrees Aries; the
sign which normally follows Aries in the zodiac is Taurus, and
Taurus 5 degrees is placed on the third cusp. The sign which
follows Taurus in the zodiac is Gemini and the symbol for
Gemini 5 degrees is put on the cusp of the fourth house; and so
forth around the chart, until there is a sign on each of the twelve
cusps or houses of the chart. (The order of the 12 signs of the
zodiac with their symbols is given in Chapter Ill, page 98).

The other nine planets are filled in on the chart in their
proper houses or positions,

According to the list of planetary positions for U. S. Steel the
Moon is 4 degrees Taurus. Since Taurus (% ) 5 degrees falls on
the cusp of the 2nd house, the Moon ()) would fali slightly
above the %nd house. Remember the signs and planets are
arranged counter-clockwise on the chart. Symbols for the signs
and planets are used on the chart and these symbols are given in
Chapter III. It is much easier and simpler to use the symbols for
the signs and planets instead of writing them out.

Neptune (‘P) falls in 26 degrees Gemini (x), in the list of
this Company's planetary positions. Since 5 degrees Gemini falls
on the cusp of the fourth house and 5 degrees Cancer on the
cusp of the fifth house, 26 degrees Gemini comes between these
two points and Neptune is placed in the fourth house. Neptune
is listed Retrograde (Rx) in the list and this means that while
the other planets are moving direct in motion or counter-clockwise
at the time this stock was incorporated, Neptune was moving
backwards in its orbit or in clockwise motion. Retrograde planets
do not seem to have as strong an influence in a chart as planets
which are moving in direct motion. The Sun and Moon are
always direct in motion; they are never Retrograde; therefore,

[113]

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

their positions are always important when analysing a stock's
future. In the list of those planetary positions given in
Chapter V, those stocks incorporated or organized from 1850-
1930 have their positions given in terms of Greenwich Mean
Time Noon. Those stocks listed as being incorporated from
1931 until the present date have their planetary positions given
in terms of Greenwich Mean Time Midnight. This fact is men-
tioned for those individuals interested in working out the minutes
on the degrees listed. For the average trader the minutes are
not important and therefore they have been omitted from the
planetary examples listed for the stocks in Chapter V. For ana-
lysing the future outlook for any stock the degrees of the planets
are all that is needed, since hour of incorporation is not known
for many stocks, and the transit method seems to work better
when using the simple outline given in the examples listed in
this Chapter.

The next planet in the list to be placed on the chart is Uranus
(8) which is in 16 degrees Sagittarius (7). 5 degrees Sagit-
tarius falls on the 10th house cusp and 5 degrees Capricorn
on the 11th house cusp. Thus 16 degrees Sagittarius falls be-
tween these two points and therefore Uranus is placed in the
10th house.

Saturn () is 13 degrees Capricorn (v9) and this point falls
between the 11th and 12th house on the chart since 5 degrees
Capricorn is on the 11th house cusp and 5 degrees Aquarius is
on the 12th house cusp.

Jupiter (26) is 6 degrees Capricorn (v3) and this point falls
tight under the 11th house cusp.

Mars (4) is 2 degrees Virgo (tm). This planet is marked
by the Retrograde symbol (Rx) because it was moving backward
in its orbit at the time this stock was incorporated. 2 degrees
Virgo falls between 5 degrees Leo and 5 degrees Virgo; there-
fore, Mars should be placed just under the 7th house cusp. Usu-
ally the same degree (in this case 4) is put on the seventh house
cusp which the Sun carries. Either 4 or 5 is all right.

Venus (9) is t7 degrees Aquarius (2) and this point falls

[114]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

between 5 degrees Aquarius and 4 degrees Pisces; therefore, it is
placed in the 12th house.

Mercury (¥) is 21 degrees Pisces (1¢) and falls between 4
degrees Pisces and 5 degrees Aties; it is, therefore, put in the
1st house. The Moon's Notth Node (Q) is 27 degrees Scorpio
(m) and this point falls between 5 degrees Scorpio and 5
degrees Sagittarius. The Moon’s North Node is therefore placed
in the 9th house. The Moon’s South Node (3) falls exactly
opposite this point in the opposite sign of the zodiac. It is
therefore put in the third house in 27 degrees Taurus. These
important points are always noted as they often give a clue as to
whether the stock would work with the general trend of the stock
market and business cycle or against it in its own general cycle.
In the case of U. S. Steel we see that this stock would move along
basically with the general trend of business and the stock market
due to the fact that Scorpio is the sign on the Business Cycle
Chart marking the transition point from normal to above normal
business activity; and Taurus is the sign on the Business Cycle
Chart which marks the transition point from normal business
activity to below normal business volume and economic condi-
tions, (For a copy of the Business Cycle Chart as originated by
the writer, see Chapter L)

The North Node has an expansive influence similar to Jupiter.
The South Node has a restrictive influence similar to Saturn.
Ia the list of planetary positions of leading stocks given in
Chapter V the North Node only is given because the South Node
always carries the same degree as the North Node in the sign
exactly opposite (180 degrees away) from the sign in which the
North Node is placed. The signs of the zodiac and their sign

opposites are:
ARIES ....... cere LIBRA
TAURUS ......... SCORPIO
GEMINI _...__-SAGITTARIUS

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

There are a number of stocks listed on the New York Stock
“Exchange which work against the genetal trend of the stock
market due to their own individual stock cycles. It is a com-
patatively easy matter to know how any stock's cycle is related
to the business cycle or general trend of the stock market by
simply noting the Node positions of a stock and then comparing
these signs positions with the Business Cycle Chart.

In the case of U. S. Steel it is easy to see that this stock would
move with the general trend of business and the general trend
of the stock market. As a proof of this (which took place
recently), last September (1937) stocks slumped and the business
curve turned downward. U. S. Steel broke during the slump
from 104.5 to 80.5. The New York Stock Exchange sent out a
questionnaire to all Exchange members and member firms to get
information on this stock’s buying and selling, in order to find
out what was back of the matket slump. They explained that this
stock was selected because as U. S. Steel had gone; so had gone
the stock market!

Another fact concerning this stock is that it is incorporated
under the sign of Pisces, which is the sign on the mid-heaven of
the New York Stock Exchange Chart. (For 2 copy of this Chart
see Chapter III). This shows a further tie-up between U. S.
Steel's trend and the trend of the stock market. Planetary trans-
sits through Pisces or in aspect to Pisces would naturally affect
the trend of the stock market and the trend of U. S. Steel simi-
larly. From 1935 to 1937 Saturn was passing through the sign
of Pisces. Uranus was in favorable aspect to Saturn until 1937
and U. S. Steel rose with the stock market consistently, breaking
only in April, 1937, and in September and October, 1937, during
the market breaks at that time. In 1935 U. S. Steel had a deficit
of $2.77 per share. During 1936 earnings amounted to $2.90
per share and the stock sold between 15.99 and 27.54 times its
earnings. During 1937 the earnings of U. S. Steel amounted to
$8.01 per share with the stock selling between 6.05 and 15.79
times its earnings. This compared with 1929 when the earnings
of this stock amounted to $21.19 per share and the stock sold

[116]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

between 7.08 and 12.35 times its earnings. In 1920, the epoch-
making planet Uranus went into the sign of Pisces and did not
leave this sign until 1927. This passage of Uranus out of Pisces
culminated in the forming of new stock for U. S. Steel.

After the planetary positions of a stock have been placed
around a chart in their proper positions, the next and most impor-
tant step is to study out the future investment possibilities of the
stock from the chart thus set up. (All stocks have their charts
set up in exactly the same manner as U. S. Steel, the example used
here in this analysis.)

The Sun (@) im any chart stands for the Company; and has
to do with the organization, management and aims of the com-
pany; the officers, and products of the firm. The Sun, and the
planetary aspects to the Sun, both at the incorporation date, and
at any future time clearly point out the profit possibilities of the
stock. The position of the Sun in any stock’s chart is the most
important planetary position to be considered and for this reason
the Sun is placed on the ascendant of the stock's chart and the
other planets placed in relation to it. This is logical, for it is a
well known fact that the organization and management of a
company determine its financial success. I have noticed that when
the Sun is badly aspected at the time of incorporation, the Cam-
pany has to merge later with another company or has to go out
of business completely. Aspects to the Sun are of paramount
importance, both at the time of incorporation and at a later date
by transit of the major planets to the Sun.

The Moon {> ) stands for the public; the buying public and
the attitude of the people toward the company or to its products.
Aspects to the Moon are important and second only to the Sun.
Regardless of how good a concern is, there must be a demand
for the goods produced and a buying public. A company which
is incorporated at a time when the Moon is in favorable aspect
to the Sun lasts a long time and is usually a most successful
organization. In the case of U. S. Steel we find that the Moon is
placed in 2 favorable sextile (60 degree) aspect to the Sun.
This is an excellent sign for continuation of this company for

{117}

 

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

many yeats to come. It has already been in existence thirty-seven
years. This is 2 long time in view of the fact that many com-
panies which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange only
three years ago have long been out of existence. Companies are
organized and go out of business over night!

Jupiter (24) stands for the money-making possibilities of a
Company. It shows the money behind a company and its
chances for expansion. In the case of U. S. Steel, Jupiter is in
6 degrees Capricom in favorable sextile (60 degree) aspect with
the Sun (Company) and in very favorable trine aspect (120 de-
gtees) with the Moon (Public). It is therefore, easy to surmise
that U. S. Steel would make money and also would be a very
popular stock with the trading public.

Saturn () stands for the limitations of the Company and
usually when Saturn is placed in unfavorable aspect to the Sun
or Moon at the time of incorporation, the Company has many
vicissitudes in a financial way. Whenever Saturn by transit moves
in unfavorable aspect to the Sun, and in a lesser degree to the
Moon, it usually is a bad year for a company. Therefore, make
it a rule never to invest in a stock when Saturn by transit is unfa-
vorably aspecting the Sin or Moon in a chart. You will find
that you will tie up your money or suffer loss by having the
stock go down on you.

Mars ( 4) governs the activity of a stock. Whenever Mars at
the time of incorporation or by transit strongly aspects the Sun,
Moon, Jupiter, or its own place at the time of incorporation, the
stock will fluctuate strongly while under the stimuli of Mars.
Other aspects in force at the time of the Mars transit determine
whether the stock will move up or down or just back-and-fill for
the time being. Always look to see whether a stock is tem-
porarily under a Mars aspect, if it starts moving in a very active
manner. Unless there are other testimonies present which indi-
cate that the stock is on an up trend, do not rush and buy a stock
because it suddenly becomes active. Aspects from Mars pass
very quickly and you may find your funds later or in a short time
tied up in an inactive stock. In the case of U. S. Steel, our exam-

ple stock, Mars is in favorable trine aspect to Jupiter and the
Moon. It is in an opposition aspect to the Sun. This would be
unfavorable, if Mars were not in favorable aspect to Jupiter and
the Moon, which in turn are in favorable aspect to the Sun, as
well as being in favorable aspect to each other! This is a very
strong favorable planetary tie-up and not only shows an active
stock, but an extremely strong Company with enlarged powers.

Another noticeable fact about U. S. Steel should be brought out
here. The Steel stocks as a Group come under the rulership of
the Earth and Water signs, that is, the signs of Taurus, Virgo,
Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, and U. S. Steel certainly
bears out this fact with every important planet in Earth and Water
signs. The Sun is in Pisces, a Water sign, and the Moon, Jupiter,
Mars, and Saturn are in Earth signs. Stability is certainly shown
here for this Company with so many planets in Earthy signs.

It is weli to know what the various sign rulerships of the main
Groups of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are. When-
ever the Sun or other major planets pass through these signs,
stocks which fall under these Groups are stimulated to activity.
This accounts for the seasonal popularity of certain Groups of
stocks which can be accounted for in no other way. Often it is
possible to trade in a certain Group of stocks for a month and
make money when other Groups are unaccentuated. For instance,
the Aviation Group comes under the rulership mainly of the
Fire signs, that is, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, with Sagittarius
patticularly strong. December, and usually the latter part of
November, is a good time to trade in Aviation stocks for they
are nearly always active at this time. During December, 1935,
1936, and 1937, the Aircraft issues were strong and active. This
was particularly so in 1935 when Jupiter, the planet of expansion,
moved into Sagittarius for a year’s stay. It is interesting to note
in connection with the strong affinity between Aviation stocks
and the sign Sagittarius that in the natural order of the signs of
the zodiac Sagittarius rules the ninth house which has to do with
distant places, long trips, and travelling.

The Chemical stocks come under the tulership of the Fire

{119}

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

signs; and as a rule, so do many of the Railroad stocks,

The Oil stocks come mainly under the influence of the Air
signs, particularly the sign of Libra. The other two Air signs
are Gemini and Aquarius.

Utilities come under a combination of Water and Barth signs.
July is often a good month for Utilities and Steel and so is Janu-
ary, the latter part of February and November. These months
do not always hold good due to the fact that there may be present
other major planets which counteract this seasonal stimulation;
however, it is well to know when certain groups will be active.
Oils are usually good in September and October of each year or
at least very active.

In studying the chart of a stock, one other planetary factor
must be taken into account and that is the planet which rules the
sign the Sun is placed in or in other words the sign under which
the stock is incorporated. In the case of U. S. Steel, the Sun is
in Pisces, and the ruler of Pisces is Neptune, which in this Com-
pany’s chart is placed in 26 degrees Gemini. Aspects to Neptune
will often give a clue to the change in trend of this stock when
other testimonies are lacking. ‘Therefore, before making any
final judgment on what a stock will or will not do in the future,
always take into consideration any aspects to the stock’s planetary
tuler. This is always the planet which mules the sign in which
the Sun is placed. (For a list of the twelve signs and their
planetary rulers see Chapter III.)

The following transits influence a stock’s future trend: the
trend will be upward if Jupiter, and Uranus arte placed in a favor-
able aspect to the Sun, that is forming angles of 0, 60, and 120
degrees.

The trend will be downward if Saturn or Uranus are placed in
unfavorable aspect to the Sun or Moon in the Company's chart.
That is, forming angles of 90 degrees, 180, 135, and in the case
of Saturn, in 0 degrees or conjunction aspect. Do not invest in a
stock which is under an unfavorable aspect to the Sun or Moon.
Always invest in a stock which is coming under a favorable
aspect from Jupiter or Uranus singly or when both planets are

{120}

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

placed in favorable aspect to each other and are aspecting the
Sun or Moon of a Company. If the major planets Saturn and
Uranus ate in favorable aspect to each other and they aspect the
Sun or Moon in a Company's chart, this is also a good time to
invest in a stock. If Saturn and Uranus are in unfavorable aspect
to each other as transits and one of the planets, or both, as

the Sun and Moon in a Company's chart, the trend will be decid-
edly downward and to invest in it would bring financial loss,

In the case of U. S. Steel, Saturn moved into Pisces in March,
1935, and this was an unfavorable influence, but at the same time
the major planet Uranus formed a favorable sextile aspect with
transiting Saturn and at the same time was in conjunction with
the Moon in the chart of U. S. Steel and in a very favorable trine
aspect to Jupiter and Mars in the chart besides being in favorable
aspect to the Sun. Im the face of such testimony, even a rank
amateur in judgment could not conclude anything else but the
fact that U. S. Steel was going up and that it was an excellent
investment possibility. This is all the more true in view of the
fact that a favorable aspect between Saturn and Uranus usually
marks an upturn in the stock market. Anyone who could have
studied the possibilities ahead for U. S. Steel in this simple
manner would have been able to make a fortune. However, how
was a trader to know how long this upturn would last? In view
of the fact that U. S. Steel moves with the stock market generally,
it was a safe estimate that this stock would go up as long as the
stock market pointed upward, which would be relatively the time
during which Saturn and Uranus were in favorable aspect. This
was from 1935-1937. In March, 1935, this stock was as low as
$30.00 per share; in March, 1937, it had risen to between
$125.00 to $130.00 per share. This stock dropped to $40.00
by the spring of 1938. It is again at a buying level, Why?

During 1939, Jupiter will be in the sign of Pisces, and at the
same time will go over the mid-heaven of the New York Stock
Exchange. It is logical to conclude that this stock is going to
rise and therefore, it is a good investment proposition for 1939,
since it is ruled by Pisces.

{ 121}

 

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

In Chapter VI of this book, the planetary positions are given
for every month (at the time of the New Moon) from 1938
until 1950. This enables a trader to know the planetary transits
to a stock for almost 12 years in advance. During 1939, Jupiter
will pass through Pisces, the sign under which U. S. Steel is incor-
porated and this stock should rise during the coming year. Dur-
ing 1939, the transiting Uranus will be in favorable aspect to
Jupiter during the spring months especially and this is added
planetary strength indicating that this stock will go up.

All stocks are studied in the same manner as U. S. Steel. It is
always necessary to set up a chart as has been done in the case of
this stock and study the planetary relationships and aspects of the
Company involved. Then in order to know whether the stock is
good for investment purposes for the future, it is necessary to
study its Node positions in order to ascertain whether the stock
would work with the general trend of the stock market. The
next and [ast step is to determine the planetary aspects for any
future year which are formed by the transiting planets to the
Sun and Moon in the chart of the stock. With a little practice,
it becomes a simple matter to know whether a stock would be a
wise investment at any particular time. Naturally, as with any
other subject, the more familiar you become with this method
of studying a stock's investment possibilities the more accurate
you become in your analysis of that stock.

‘As an example of a stock which offered tremendous possibili-
ties for profit within a space of five years and which probably
nobody invested in, it is interesting to study the chart of Spiegel,
Inc. (SMS), formerly Spiegel-May-Stern Co. This stock was
incorporated April 28, 1928, in Delaware. Its planetary posi-
tions are given in Chapter V, as follows:

Sun 7 degrees Taurus; Moon 27 degrees Leo; Neptune 26
degrees Leo, Retrograde; Uranus 5 degrees Aries; Saturn 8
degrees Sagittarius, Retrograde; Jupiter 21 degrees Aries, Venus
20 degrees Aries; Mescury 2 degrees Taurus; the Moon's North
Node 11 degrees Gemini.

The chast of this company is set up in exactly the same manner

as the chart of U. S. Steel. The Sun is placed on the ascendant
with its degree, that is 7 degrees Taurus. The remaining eleven
houses have the remaining eleven signs of the zodiac placed
around the chart in their proper order with 8 degrees equally
placed on the eleven house cusps. The planets are then put in
their proper houses, depending, of course, for their positions on
the degree of the sign which they carry. For a copy of this chart
correctly set up see “Example II”.

In May, 1932, the stock of Spiegel, May, Stern Co. sold for
6214¢ per share. For the sum of $500.00, 800 shares of SMS
could have been bought. By December, 1936, the stock's value
had climbed to $114.50 per share. If this stock had been pur-
chased in May, 1932, for 621/,¢ per share and 800 shares had
been bought, these 800 shares would have been worth $91,600.00!
In five years time another opportunity for sound investment had
passed and probably there are very few people who took advan-
tage of it.

‘What in this company’s chart showed that it would have such
phenomena! money-making possibilities? A study of this com-
pany’s chart reveals much.

It is a well known fact, in this method of studying a stock's
future, that a chart which shows the Sun, which is symbolic of
the Company, under unfavorable aspects at the time of the incor-
poration has very little chance of making money. The same
tule holds true for the Moon in a lesser degree. The Moon is
symbolic of the Public; the public buying interest and the atti-
tude of the masses toward the product for sale. If the Moon is
badly aspected at the time of incorporation, the Company works
under a heavy handicap and more often than not eventually has
to go out of business.

In the Chart of Spiegel, Inc. the Sun (Company) is in favor-
able semi-sextile aspect with the epoch-making planet Uranus.
Mercury is in conjunction with the Sun giving added trading
strength. Uranus is also in favorable semi-sextile aspect to Mer-
cary. The Moon (Public) is in conjunction with Neptune and
in very favorable trine aspect to both Venus and Jupiter (fnan-

[124]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

cial possibilities), Venus and Jupiter are in conjunction with each
other in Aries. The limitations of the Company are shown by
Saturn's position and aspects. This planet in the chart of SMS
is in very favorable trine aspect to Jupiter (money-making possi-
bilities of the Company). Mars ruling the activity of the stock
is in favorable semi-sextile aspect to Jupiter and Venus. It is in
unfavorable square aspect to Saturn, but since Saturn is trine
Jupiter (financial gain), this aspect between Mars and Saturn
is not as forceful as it otherwise would be, if both planets were
not favorably aspecting the money-making planet Jupiter.

Therefore, it is easy to conclude that this stock was a good
investment. The Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and even restrictive Saturn
in favorable aspect at the time of incorporation. After this stock
was incorporated, it did not immediately go up. There were no
major transiting aspects present to bring out the latent possibilities
of the good chart, In 1932, the epoch-making Uranus, which
was favorably aspecting the Sun (Company) at the time of incor-
poration, moved into conjunction with Jupiter and Venus in
Aries, forming at the same time a very favorable trine aspect
with the Moon (Public) and Neptune in Leo. This started the
upturn which continued upward sharply from 1934 through 1936
when Uranus moved through the first 10 degrees of Taurus and
over the Sun’s degree of 7 Taurus.

To know whether this stock is a good buy for the future, or
whether any stock is a good investment for the tuture, it is neces-
sary to study the transits of the major planets which will aspect
the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter at that time. In the case of this
stock (SMS), transiting Jupiter will be in favorable sextile aspect
during the first two months of 1939. This is due to the fact that
Jupiter will be in Pisces at this time and passing through the
first ten degrees or decanate of Pisces. Pisces forms a sextile
aspect with the sign Taurus and planets passing through the first
10 degrees of Pisces would be in favorable sextile aspect to the
Sun in this company’s chart, which is in 7 degrees Taurus. This is
favorable for gains. During the summer months of 1939, Jupiter
will move into Aries and will pass through the first 10 degrees

[123]

 

 


McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

of the sign. In this position transiting Jupiter will form a con-
junction aspect with Uranus and 2 semi-sextile aspect with the
Sun. This is a favorable indication.

During all of 1939 Saturn will be passing through the third
decanate (or 20 to 30 degrees) Aries. In this position, transiting
Saturn will exert a conservative influence over the financial gains
of this company. Saturn's influence is always to limit, curb, and
restrain unless it is under very favorable aspects from transiting
Uranus at the same time. Saturn passing through the last 10
degrees of Aries forms a conjunction aspect with Jupiter, Venus,
and a trine aspect with the Moon and Neptune.

During 1940, both Jupiter and Satum will transit the sign of
Taurus and io this position will pass over the Sun of this Com-
pany. This is a mixed indication for the gains of this Company,
but in view of the fact that the Sun was well aspected at the time
of incorporation, this stock should go upward.

Every chart, like every individual, has similar characteristics,
but always there will be present a new set of conditions not pres-
ent in the other. It takes time and practice to become adept in
analysing the charts of stocks, but it is interesting, and very
worthwhile, since it helps you to obtain financial independence
through investment of a sound and practical nature. The more
time you give to this subject the more money you will be able
to make. There is no method except the theory propounded in
this book which offers such a quick and accurate analysis of indi-
vidual stocks for the average man in the street who has a small
capital to invest.

The positions of the transiting planets for every month during
the next twelve years is given in the Ephemeris in Chapter VI.
The incorporation date of every important stock listed on the
New York Stock Exchange (as of July 1, 1938), with its planetary
positions for that date, are given in Chapter V. Charts for each
and every one of the stocks listed are set up as the three charts
for the three stocks used as examples in this chapter. They are
analysed in the same way. The first step, after setting up the
chart correctly, is to study out the planetary aspects present in

[126]

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

the chart, particularly those to the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. This
gives the clue to the long life of the company; its relationship
with the consuming public; and its money-making possibilities.
The position and aspects to Saturn show the setbacks financially
and otherwise which the company is apt to experience. Mars
shows its strength and activity on the market.

The second step is to refer to the Ephemeris in Chapter VI and
see when the major planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune
aspect important planetary positions in the chart. This will give
you the clue to when a big up or down movement will take
place in the stock. When you are studying a stock and you find
it is under no major planetary aspects for that period, then you
are safe in judging that it will be in a sideways movement until
it comes under major planetary aspects and that to tie-up money
in the stock will bring you little or no financial returns. Invest
in stocks which you know are coming under favorable planetary
aspects only. Spiegel, Inc. (SMS) the stock used for “Example
IP” is a good example of a stock which was coming under favor-
able aspects for several years to come and whose favorable indica-
tions for the future were clearly pointed out by its chart several
years in advance.

If you have your capital invested in a stock whose chart clearly
shows that it is coming under unfavorable transiting aspects, the
thing to do is to find a chart of a stock which is coming under
favorable aspects and buy in the stock favorably aspected. There
is no virtue in holding a stock which is not making money
for you.

It is interesting to study the chart of Sears Roebuck Co. (S)
which was incorporated June 16, 1906, in New York, The
planetary positions for this stock, which are given in Chapter V,
ate as follows: The Sun 24 degrees Gemini; the Moon 24 degrees
Aries; Neptune 9 degrees Cancer; Uranus 7 degrees Capricorn;
Saturn 14 degrees Pisces; Jupiter 20 degrees Gemini; Mars 3
degrees Cancer; Venus 25 degrees Cancer; Mercury 3 degtees
Cancer. The Moon's North Node 14 degrees Leo. This chart
illustrates the enormous merchandising concer it represents.

‘That this company would be in existence a long time is shown by
the fact that the Sun (Company) is in a very favorable sextile
(60 degree) aspect with the Moon (Public) besides being in
conjunction with the money-making planet Jupiter. Jupiter
(financial possibilities) was in favorable sextile aspect with the
Moon (Public). Venus, which has to do with clothes, cosmetics,
or any items which have to do with women and children, was in
semi-sextile aspect to both the Sun and Jupiter. Mars, which
has to do with the activity of the company and stock, and the
planet which sometimes shows the application of the company’s
interests, is in conjunction with Mercury (the mail) and Neptune
(selling). Neptune also represents dealings which never actually
contact a person face to face. Then again the sign of Cancer
tules the home, and everything which has to do with the home,
and there are four planets out of the nine in that sign. It would
be easy to judge that this company has something to do with
merchandise that is in some way connected with the home. It
often happens that you can judge the kind of business a company
is in by studying the planetary positions in force at the time it
was incorporated. Sears Roebuck Co. is an excellent stock to
study from its chart as it reveals much about the company which
otherwise would never be known from a set of statistics concern-
ing the company and its assets.

The chart of Sears Roebuck Co. is set up in the same way as
the two other stocks used as examples in this chapter. The Sun
in 24 degrees Gemini is placed on the ascendant. The remaining
eleven signs follow in consecutive order and carry 25 degrees, ex-
cept the seventh sign of Sagittarius, which carries the 24th degree.
(The sign which falls on the seventh house opposite the ascendant
always carries the same degree as the ascendant or first house).
The planets are then placed around the chart in their proper
places. A copy of the chart correctly set up accompanies this
Chapter and is marked “Example HI’. It would be a good idea,
if you are not familiar with the setting up of charts to practice
on setting up the three example charts in this Chapter to familiar-
ize yourself with the process.

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

By studying the major transits affecting this stock for investment
purpose, for 1938, we see that Jupiter is forming a very favorable
trine aspect during this year, but that Neptune is placed in an
unfavorable square aspect at the same time. This configuration
represents two forces which are pulling against each other. Gains
should predominate, but trading caution is advised before invest-
ing. During 1939, both Jupiter and Neptune will be unfavorably
placed to the Sun and Jupiter in this company’s stock. Careful
study of the chart and actual movements of Sears Roebuck should
be studied before buying during 1939.

It often happens that transiting Mars, which moves very quickly
through the zodiac, aspects Jupiter or Mars, in a stock’s chart and
during the transit the stock becomes very active. Do not be misled
by this sudden activity of a stock, for as soon as the Mars aspect
passes, the stock is apt to resume its former position or else, if
it is not aspected by any major planets at the time, to then lapse
into inactivity.

The forecasts for the “example stocks” are intended to be used
as guides on how to forecast future trends of a stock, They are
not intended to be buying and selling information. The only way
to learn how to forecast the future trends of stocks, according to
this method, is to work out examples in real life. We learn by
actually doing a thing—not by reading pages of theory. The
analyses of the three stocks are also intended for study purposes
only. The three stocks chosen were picked for no particular finan-
cial reason, but were chosen at random from the list in Chapter V,
merely, because they would illustrate the points brought out in
this Chapter on how to forecast the trends of individual stocks.

When applying the transits to the chart of the stocks, if the
reader is not familiar with aspects, favorable and unfavorable, he
should study Chapter III and also “ASPECTS” in the Glossary of
Chapter VII. It is absolutely necessary to be familiar with the
angular relationships existing between the planets at the time a
company was incorporated, and also know how to tell at a glance
from the Ephemeris whether a planet is forming an aspect of
importance to the Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Saturn in a company’s

{130}

McWhirter Theory of Stock Market Forecasting

chart, at any given time. It is also necessary for the reader to
know the order of the signs of the zodiac in order to be able to
place them correctly around the chart.

Blank charts for erecting the charts of stocks may be quickly
drawn off on a blank sheet of paper from the one’s shown in
this book or a prepated pad may be bought at an astrological
bookstore. Any one can learn this method of forecasting the
trend of stocks in a short time, if he is willing to learn a few
simple principles and apply them.

Simplified Ephemeris of the Planets—
1938-1950

Tes simplified ephemeris of the planets is a table of the
planetary positions given every twenty-eight days at the time
of the New Moon or Junation. At this time of the month the
angular relationship of the planets give a clue to the trend of
business as well as the stack market for the coming twenty-eight
days. By means of simple proportion the degrees of the planets
are easily obtainable for any day between any two lunation
petiods. The average daily motion for the Sun is: 59/08”; the
average daily motion for the Moon is 13 degrees 10°36”; the
average daily motion of Mercury is 59’08”; the average daily
motion for Venus is 59’08”; the average daily motion for Mars
is 33’28”; the average daily motion for Jupiter is 4°59”; the
average daily motion for Saturn is 2’; the average daily motion
for Uranus is 42”; the average daily motion for Neptune is 24”.
