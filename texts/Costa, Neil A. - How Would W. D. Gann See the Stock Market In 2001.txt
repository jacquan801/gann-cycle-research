    "How Would W. D. Gann See the Stock
             Market in 2001?"

                                                                         Neil A Costa

William Delbert Gann was reputed to have made US$50 million from trading the stock and commodities
markets. We will never know how accurate this figure is, however it is clear that he made a considerable
amount of money.

Gann's awesome forecasting ability is beyond question. His annual forecasts sold for large sums of money due
to their uncanny accuracy. He was able to make such accurate forecasts after discovering his Master Time
Factor in 1908.

Soon after discovering this market timing tool, he traded two trading accounts. The first he opened with $300,
and he made $25,000 in a period of three months. The second account started with $130 and he made
$12,000 in the same 30 days.

Richard Wykoff, the well-known editor of the Ticker and Investment Digest and one of the most respected
writers on the stock market of all time, wrote an article on Gann's discoveries and his exceptional trading ability.
The article was titled 'William D. Gann. An Operator Whose Science and Ability Place Him in the Front Rank.
His Remarkable Predictions and Trading Record'.

In order to verify Gann's trading record, an independent observer monitored Gann's trading during October:


                    During the month of October, 1909, in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann
                    made, in the presence of our representative, two hundred and eighty-six
                    transactions in various stocks, on both the long and the short side of the
                    market. Two hundred and sixty-four of these transactions resulted in profits;
                    twenty-two in losses.

                    The capital with which he operated was doubled ten times, so that at the end
                    of the month he had one thousand per cent. on his original margin.

                    … We have seen him give in one day sixteen successive orders in the same
                    stock, eight of which turned out to be at either the top or the bottom eighth of
                    that particular swing. The above we can positively verify.

                    Such performances as these, coupled with the foregoing, are probably
                    unparalleled in the history of the Street.

                    Gann acknowledged having made half a million dollars from his trading over
                    the previous few years.

(Ticker and Investment Digest, Volume 5, Number 2, December, 1909, page 54.)

The representative of Ticker and Investment Digest was able to verify Gann's success as a trader. "I once saw
him take $130, and in less that one month run it up to over $12,000. He can compound money faster than any
man I ever met."

(Ticker and Investment Digest, Volume 5, Number 2, December, 1909, page 54.)

The publication of the Ticker and Investment Digest article made W.D. Gann famous. Subsequently, the New
York Herald, the New York Sun, the New York Evening Telegram, the New York Morning Telegraph and other
newspapers and journals throughout the world commented on his accurate stock and commodity forecasts.

Gann published his Annual Stock Forecast in December of each year. In his own words:


                    This forecast gives the trend of stocks for the following year; gives dates each
                    month when high and low prices will be made; tells when extreme highs or
                    lows of the year can be expected; and also informs whether stocks are in a
                    Bull or Bear cycle. This forecast is based on a "time" factor which I have
                    discovered. I have been able to forecast every major campaign for the last
                    twenty years. Copies of Forecasts of recent years mailed free.

1930, Appendix page 46. Reprinted with the kind permission of Nikki Jones, owner of Lambert-Gann Publishing
Co., Inc.)

The price of Gann's Annual Stock Forecast was $100.00 in 1930 - this was a large sum of money 70 years ago.

Late in Gann's life he taught selected students his forecasting methods. In 1954, at the age of 76, Gann's Great
Master Course sold for US$5,000 - the price of an average house at that time. I believe that this course, and
the letters he sent to his clients in the early 1950s, explained how he compiled his forecasts. Copies of many of
these letters were discovered soon after the death of Gann's former partner, Ed. Lambert, two years ago.

Gann's most famous forecast, the forecast for 1929, warned that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (See '30
Industrials' below) would peak on September 3, 1929 and subsequently crash. History confirms that Gann
predicted the exact end of the 1920's stock market boom. This was an extremely important top, as the market
declined more than 90 percent until its low in 1932.

Gann's published forecasts in the period 1919 to 1926 were 85 to 90 percent accurate in picking intermediate
and major market tops and bottoms. They are published in his courses.


How Did Gann Forecast?
Gann's forecasts were conducted using a range of techniques. He analysed major cycles, including natural
cycles, looking for history to repeat. He also used forecasting tools he developed such as squaring time and
price, or tools he modified, such as solar degrees and the square of nine.


The Stock Market in 2001
I first started presenting my analysis of the major cycles Gann followed in 1995 to a conference of the
Australian Technical Analysts' Association (ATAA). That was an easy year to forecast, as all of the major cycles
I analyzed suggested that the year would be a Bull year. In fact, Gann had called the fifth year of the decade
his 'Year of Ascension'.

I presented a similar analysis when I addressed ATAA meetings and during seminars in every subsequent
year. In each case this technique successfully forecast the direction of the Dow (and the Australian market) for
that year, and any likely sudden moves, such as the falls in October 1997, 1999 and April 2000.

The Year 2001 is a difficult year to call without seeing how it starts to unfold. Previous major cycles pertinent to
this year were as follows:


CYCLE DIRECTION COMMENTS
100-year Down   Peak in June.
90-year Flat    Peak mid-May to late July.
80-year Up      Peaks May, December. Lows June, August.
70-year Down    Peak late February.
60-year Down    Rallies July to September.
50-year Up      Strong up move late June to mid September.
40-year Up      Up January to early September, then flat.
30-year Up      Up Jan. to Apr. then down. Rally Aug./Sept., low Nov.
20-year Down    Held up until end of June. Down to late Sept. then flat.
10-year Up      Up Jan. to early March then flat. Rally in December.

As can be seen from the above, five cycles were up, four were down, and one was flat. This is not very
definitive.

There are a number of bullish and bearish factors to note:

Bullish:

      ●    The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice, with a third cut likely. There is an old market
           axiom which says "Don't fight the Fed". A low interest rate environment is generally bullish for the stock
           market.
      ●    The market is presently rallying after an initial dip. This could, of course, be a bear market rally.

Bearish:

      ●    The Price / Earnings ratios of many U.S. stocks are at historically high levels.
      ●    There is speculation in the United States and Australia of a recession.
      ●    Major world markets finished the year lower last year. These include:
               ❍ Dow (United States) - down 6%.

               ❍ Nikkei (Japan) - down 27%.

               ❍ FTSE (UK) - down 10%.

               ❍ DAX (Germany) - down 7%.

               ❍ Hang Seng (Hong Kong) - down 11%.



The declines were much greater for markets such as Taiwan.

Australia, on the other hand, finished the year up just two points. The Year 2000 was the fifth consecutive year
in which the market finished higher.

Dawn Bolton-Smith, an analyst and trader respected throughout the world, said at an ATAA meeting in
Brisbane in February 2001, "it is a year to be cautious"! I couldn't agree more.

The key is to watch the market closely, and to see how closely it parallels one of the above cycles. The rally
that is occurring at the time of writing (February 5, 2001) is consistent with many of the cycles listed above, and
thus does not give us much lead as to what is likely to happen for the rest of the year.

Around the end of March 2001, the pattern for the year may be clear. The Year 2000 paralleled the 40-year
cycle closely. Such a road map can be very helpful information for the experienced trader and/or investor.
